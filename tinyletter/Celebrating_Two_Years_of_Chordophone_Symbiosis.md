Sto­ries of ther­a­py and indis­ci­pline through­out twen­ty years of piano impro­vi­sa­tion.
I have nev­er pub­licly elab­o­rat­ed upon my rela­tion­ship with the piano as an instru­ment. I’ve banned myself from writ­ing about music, giv­en the over­whelm­ing amount of knowl­edge between the musi­cians, DJs, and pro­duc­ers of our com­mu­ni­ty, but this — the only life­long habit of mine — is about some­thing else, entire­ly. It’s defin­i­tive­ly my pri­ma­ry coun­ter­weight to *Extra­tone*-relat­ed activ­i­ties and stress­es, but I think there’s poten­tial insight in explor­ing the nature of my com­pul­sions. It’s going to be awful­ly intro­spec­tive, (and prob­a­bly vain,) so don’t con­tin­ue unless you’re intrigued by the bizarre essence of human impro­vi­sa­tion, and no more than min­i­mal­ly-miffed by the idea of a skin­ny white EIC reflect­ing on the pres­ence of music through­out his child­hood while the world burns.

When I was three, my father began giv­ing me rudi­men­ta­ry piano lessons for a bit, with col­ored stick­ers indi­cat­ing the the­o­ry behind the yel­low­ing ivory of his mid-20th cen­tu­ry upright Bald­win (which sounds like an *entiret­ly* dif­fer­ent sort of con­trap­tion than *my* mid-20th cen­tu­ry upright Bald­win.) Even at such an age, I was *not* keen on third-par­ty pres­sures on my sched­ule, or the des­ti­na­tion of my effort, so I did not enjoy it. My aca­d­e­m­ic knowl­edge of psy­chol­o­gy is lim­it­ed, but my first-hand famil­iar­i­ty with the essence of human psy­chol­o­gy is quite advanced, thanks to 4 years of full-time pres­ence in con­ve­nience stores. That said…

I sin­cere­ly believe that I have nev­er met any­one so entire­ly con­sumed by unwa­ver­ing resis­tance to wis­dom, advice, crit­i­cism, or con­sul­ta­tion as my child­hood self. I was actu­al­ly smart in a way that was notable, then (some­thing like an 8th grade read­ing lev­el in kinder­garten,) and chal­lenged, too. Whether by nature or my own voli­tion, I don’t remem­ber ever enjoy­ing any­thing that I did not dis­cov­er or seek myself. It wasn’t the “I’m going to pre­tend not to like this just because you told me to do it” act. Or — if it was — it was unshak­ably root­ed in my core psy­che; I *gen­uine­ly* despised any­thing I was told to do, with­out fail. 

I’m not descend­ing into an auto­bi­og­ra­phy: this defin­ing truth is the foun­da­tion of my entire his­to­ry of chor­doac­tion.

I went every month — I think — to see a teacher in the base­ment of a small town Bap­tist church for close to a decade, and I *did* prac­tice recit­ing lesson­book lit­er­a­ture dur­ing that time. Per­haps 10 cumu­la­tive hours. 60 min­utes of prac­tice a year, if you aver­aged it all out.
And I did learn to play sim­pli­fied melodies over that time. A few pages from scholas­tic lesson­books, here and there; recitals, duets, and the occa­sion­al tol­er­at­ed hol­i­day ambiance. I remem­ber my the­o­ry knowl­edge — though stunt­ed sig­nif­i­cant­ly by my apa­thy — just begin­ning to become some­thing usable before I quit entire­ly at 14.

I was on the verge of reli­able sight-read­ing, actu­al­ly. (A real-time trans­la­tion of chart to sound, usu­al­ly used to indi­cate lit­tle-to-no pri­or expe­ri­ence with the tune.)

Nine years lat­er, and I’d have to start count­ing spaces and lines if you want­ed me to iden­ti­fy any­thing beyond the octaves imme­di­ate­ly sur­round­ing Mid­dle-C (the very cen­ter of a stan­dard key­board.) If that doesn’t mean any­thing to you, don’t wor­ry; it doesn’t to me, either.

The­o­ry-craft­ed recita­tion and the activ­i­ty I have spent 99.5% of my key­time engaged upon are **not relat­ed in the slight­est** for me.

That may be an exag­ger­a­tion…

Per­haps I should return to ori­gin again.
The for­mal lessons I attend­ed in my youth, along with all relat­ed “assign­ments” occu­pied such a small por­tion of my space that they wouldn’t cross my mind for weeks on end.
*How­ev­er*, there was def­i­nite­ly a moment — I can­not hon­est­ly tell you that I reli­ably recall the spe­cif­ic cir­cum­stances or year it occurred, but the sum­mer after first or sec­ond grade is my best guess — when I arrived *com­pul­sive­ly* at that neglect­ed, dis­as­trous­ly out of tune, caramel-rot­ted, click­ey-keyed Baldie and pushed a key for *absolute­ly nobody.*

*When­ev­er fam­i­ly (or the occa­sion­al stranger) asks me why I can’t ‘teach’ their child, I am forced to recre­ate this sto­ry from scratch, so I guess it’s pro­duc­tive of me to final­ly get it down.* 

In my very human, very child­ish mind, I was lim­it­ed by per­for­mance anx­i­ety (and still am by a very spe­cif­ic form of it) to play­ing for a per­ceived nought. But when my father would leave me alone in that farm­house while he worked, a buffer of at least two miles would form at any spot on the clock — I had as guar­an­teed ‘a soli­tude as you can find in the Mid­west, and those oppor­tu­ni­ties are the great­est con­trib­u­tors to the rela­tion­ship I have with the instru­ment today.

I don’t remem­ber the orig­i­nal moment of dis­cov­ery, but there are three dis­tinct ele­men­tary school-era instances in my mind of blis­ter­ing my fin­gers from whole after­noons spent pound­ing away in my first two octaves. In all three cas­es, I refrained from stop­ping even after notic­ing them, and — in all three cas­es — blood was the end result.

The sound itself was *very* rudi­men­ta­ry. Dupli­cat­ed hands on a sin­gle-octave spread was all I was capa­ble of. C, E, G, Mid­dle-C, E, G, in the begin­ning. But to coax my devel­op­ing brain to pipe a trick­le of even the most basal uncon­scious infor­ma­tion to the devel­op­ing mus­cles in my tiny fin­gers so that old instru­ment could trans­late it into some­thing I could *hear*… It’s called *impro­vi­sa­tion*, and — for me, then and now — it is entire­ly irre­sistible. It is serene. 

After twen­ty years, it is also *nec­es­sary*. Two years ago, I was away from a piano for ~two weeks in Col­orado, holed up, read­ing *Die Ver­wand­lung* in a ski­ing lodge while my sib­lings actu­al­ly enjoyed them­selves. (But *I* couldn’t pos­si­bly do what I *should* have been doing.) 

Kafka’s mas­tery is in the vis­cer­al *itch­i­ness* present as the con­se­quences of Gregor’s being are pro­gres­sive­ly described, and I exposed myself to it while occu­py­ing the cheap­est, tack­i­est light-wood chairs of our utter­ly silent lit­tle cor­ner room at 10,000 feet — oxy­gen-deprived, whisky-drunk, and over­dressed. In all like­li­hood, I was deliri­ous as I’ll ever be. I’d tagged along on the annu­al trip for the first time just three weeks after the girl I’d been with for five years — with whom I’d grown up with, and had by then planned to spend the rest of my life with — had more or less inex­plic­a­bly sev­ered all con­tact with me. I was just begin­ning upon *2015: Year of Tan­quer­ay,* dur­ing which I’d spend four fig­ures on gin and accom­plish noth­ing but the post­pone­ment of my grief.
