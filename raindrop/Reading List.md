## Description

Since I first began working online in 2016, I have grown and maintained quite a curatorial habit, and therefore sought all sorts of modern curator's tools. The system I settled upon for some five years: a dedicated Reading List channel in Extratone's Discord. It wasn't until this past year that I encouraged something which (so far) has exceeded willy-nilly copy-and-paste of URLs into a single feed. It's an application/bookmarking service called Raindrop which includes tagging, public, RSS-enabled collections, and fairy competent web page archiving.

This is my main Reading List Raindrop feed, but there are a bunch more on my Profile, which will likely remain quite fluid for the time being.
