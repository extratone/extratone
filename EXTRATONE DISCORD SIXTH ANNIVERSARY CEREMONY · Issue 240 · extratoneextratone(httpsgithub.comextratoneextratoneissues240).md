In just under two hours, our @Discord server - the very first thing to be called Extratone, ever - will be SIX years old. We'd love it if you'd stop by to hang out... And/or maybe DESTROY IT VIOLENTLY. https://bit.ly/tratosix

Going to do our best to stream it to YouTube, but really I just didn't know of any other way to create a public landing page for an upcoming online event because I haven't done this in years. https://youtu.be/bTWO6bG1fI0
