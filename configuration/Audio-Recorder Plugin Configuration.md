sincere apologies if this has already been addressed before, (I see it was asked about in June but I was unable to find anything beyond the query,) but regarding the Core Audio Recorder Plugin, I was basically just wondering if *anything* about it (aside from its hotkeys) is/might soon be configurable. and of course by that I mean options like:
1. Specifying a dedicated directory for audio files?
2. Specifying/swapping between audio input devices
3. Maybe even altering the format theyâ€™re encoded in?
