This is an extension to clip websites and download them into a readable markdown file. Please keep in mind that it is not guaranteed to work on all websites.

To use this add-on, simply click the add-on icon while you are browsing the page you want to save offline. A popup will show the rendered markdown so you can make minor edits or copy the text, or you can click the download button to download an .md file.  
Selecting text will allow you to download just the selected text

## Context Menus
You can also right-click on pages, images, links and selections to copy or download snippets of Markdown.  
You can also download all tabs in a window as Markdown files

## External Libraries
It uses the following libraries:
- [Readability.js](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) by Mozilla in version from commit [52ab9b5c8916c306a47b2119270dcdabebf9d203](https://github.com/mozilla/readability/commit/52ab9b5c8916c306a47b2119270dcdabebf9d203#diff-06d8d22df421dacde90a2268083424ab). This library is also used for the Firefox Reader View and it simplifies the page so that only the important parts are clipped. (Licensed under Apache License Version 2.0)
- [Turndown](https://github.com/domchristie/turndown) by Dom Christie in version 7.0.1 is used to convert the simplified HTML (from Readability.js) into markdown. (Licensed under MIT License)
- [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com) version 2.27.0 used to format dates in template variables

# Permissions

## Pricing
Huh? This is an open-source extension I made *for fun*. It's completely free.
However, if you absolutely *have* to send me money because you like it that
much, feel free to throw some coins in my hat via the following:

# Version History
## 2.4.1
- Add option for Obsidian-style image links (when downloading images with the markdown file)
- Downloaded images should download relative to the markdown file in the case where you specify a subfolder in your title template
- Front- and back-matter template will no longer put in extra lines on Opera
- Adjusted the way text is copied to the clipboard

## 2.4.0
- Fixed typo on options page (thanks Dean Cook)
- Added option to download images alongside the markdown file
    - Also added the ability to add a prefix to the images you download, so you can, for example, save them in a subfolder

- Updated turndown to 7.0.1 and allowed iframes to be kept in the markdown
- Added a new `{pageTitle}` option for template replacement (there are many websites where the `{title}` and `{pageTitle}` actually differ)
- Added a context menu option to copy a tab URL as a markdown link, using the title configured in settings as the link title (i.e. `[<custom title>](<URL>)`)
- Added custom disallowed characters to strip from titles (set to `[]#^` by default for maximum compatibility with Obsidian)
- Added some focus styling so you can tell what is focused
- Auto-focus the download button (you can now `ctrl`+`shift`+`M`, Enter to quickly download a file)
