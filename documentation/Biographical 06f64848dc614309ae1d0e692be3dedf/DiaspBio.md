I'm #newhere, more or less, but I've been interested in the Fediverse since I [interviewed Eugen Rochko](http://extratone.com/tech/mastod) last April on Mastodon's Big Day. I *really* dove in after I suddenly (read: *finally*) realized that I hadn't been getting what I was seeking from Twitter for years, but that it was right there... here... everywhere... to be had, thanks to this community. I'm just returning to a *slightly* more balanced life after spending three years at full-throttle trying to launch an independent online magazine and have been "feeling things out," as those who have absolutely no idea what to do next say.

For the moment, the task I've set for myself is to do my absolute best to find the same magic in computers and technology again that I felt so strongly as a preteen, ten years ago, when the future seemed like it was surely bound to be the most wonderous expansion the human intellect had ever seen. This year, I've enjoyed freely writing and blogging from within this journey on [My Very Own Web Site](http://bilge.world) after punishing myself for doing the same thing anyway and [publishing it on the magazine ](http://extratone.com/red) since 2016. Said another way: **I've been fuckin around locally *and* on the web**, yet learning more than ever in the process about the [first Texan steps toward open source](http://bilge.world/compaq-portable-comeback/), [the extended, dramatic saga of word processing software](http://bilge.world/lotus-smartsuite-and-the-year-2000/), [the origin of digital publishing](http://bilge.world/panic-urine/), and *especially* [the history of streaming music](http://bilge.world/what-has-bandcamp-done-for-you-as-an-artist/). Whether or not my perspective on technology will grow to be a truly worthwhile voice remains to be seen, but I'm clinging on to the dream of the 80s and 90s for now - though I won't be [carrying it on a plane](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/101002726113716524) ever again.

If you ever need a petty, pretentious ear for a good old rabble about UX design, I'm always down to talk about the things we use and what makes them good or bad. If you ever find yourself wanting to review an electronic music record or live experience, please pitch me because I might just pay you.

I enjoy communicating with people about virtually any subject **except food**, which bores the crap out of me, sorry. It should also be made clear that any engagement regarding the Compaq Computer Corporation will be met with extreme jubilation.

A comprehensive, regularly-updated directory of my other accounts across the fediverse can be found on *[BILGE.WORD](http://bilge.world/federated) * and [Dropbox Paper](http://bit.ly/federdavid); links on the plain old megablasted hulk of the second web can be found below.

If you'd like, please [suggest a name for my new computer](http://bilge.world/name-my-surface-laptop-2/). I appreciate you and sincerely look forward to our future I N T E R A C T I O N.
