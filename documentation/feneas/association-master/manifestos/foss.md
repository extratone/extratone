# FOSS Manifesto

This document outlines the relations of Feneas to FOSS (Free and Open Source Software).

Feneas as an assocation is focused on FOSS solutions and furthering FOSS where it is able to. This manifesto should be used as a set of rules in the day to day management of association resources and making of decisions.

Major changes to this document should be approved in annual general meetings. Smaller additions and corrections can be done via the association committee decision process.

This manifesto must not be in conflict with our Code of Conduct or base legal rules of the association.

## Committee

Committee members are expected to have a strong relationship with FOSS. This should be considered when considering new committee members or voting to approve a new committee in an annual meeting.

## Community

While we prefer for everyone to commit to writing, using and promoting FOSS, we will not exclude developers who write proprietary code, since that would violate our Code of Conduct. We do however encourage proprietary software developers to release their source code under a FOSS compatible license.

## Promotion

We will never spend funds on advertising non-FOSS projects. When promoting projects via our blog, social network outlets or chat channels, we refrain from promoting non-FOSS projects. However, promoting a service to help users on non-FOSS platforms reach people on FOSS platforms is ok. We do also thank our sponsors even if their service is not fully FOSS (see Sponsors below). 

## Sponsors

Feneas accepts sponsorships, but only from organizations that have a good relationship with FOSS. Sponsorships from organizations that are seen harmful to FOSS should be rejected. Sponsorships should be evaluated case by case.

Sponsorships that are accepted can be highlighted on the association home page with a simple mention, link and logo. This can be done even if the service is not FOSS, as long as the sponsor can be said to have a good relationship with FOSS.

## Grants or funding given

Feneas should never spend association funds to fund development of a proprietary project. Funding of individual developers who work on code must be only done for work on FOSS projects or components that can be said to directly benefit FOSS projects.

## Services

The services that Feneas hosts should be composed of software licensed as FOSS.

Software that has a baseline in FOSS and extra features under an enterprise license scheme should be considered case by case if an enterprise license should be received as sponsorship. When considering the relationship with FOSS of the company providing the license on top of the FOSS base software should be considered case by case.

Funds should not be spent under any circumstance to host fully proprietary software.

## Code produced

All code produced for Feneas should be licensed under a FOSS license, unless for exceptional reasons this cannot be done. An example for this is for example repositories containing purely administrative, infrastructure or members directory related scripts.

## Political affiliation

The term "not politically affiliated" in our rules does not conflict with our FOSS manifesto. Our rules say we are not politically aligned because our Code of Conduct does not allow discriminating based on political affiliation. Additionally, "Free Software" is not a political party that we could claim to be affiliated with. The term "not politically affiliated" means we are not active in the Finnish or any other political landscape and also means we will not receive money from political parties. At no point does "not politically aligned" mean that we are not strongly committed to FOSS and the advance of Free Software.
