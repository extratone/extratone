The project's mascot is dandelion, and diaspora* servers are called \"pods\". Information about the new network spread far and wide like dandelion's seeds in the wind, attracting newcomers, increasing the number of available pods. Today it's a community project with a stable userbase. Many people joined diaspora* in search of a macroblogging platform independent from corporations.",
