**Happy 2020, fedizens!**

Storm of applause 👏 for all long-time Fediverse supporters, and a warm welcome 👍 to every new user who found Fediverse in 2019.

![Constellation of stars forming "You're in Fediverse" phrase](/en/post/fediverse-in-2019/in-fediverse.jpg)

Here's what happened to  our small corner of the Internet in the past year.

### Fediverse in numbers

In 2019 the reachable Fediverse grew from 3.986 instances to 5.027 - that's roughly 🎉 <span class="u-emphasize">1.000</span> new servers online.

The number of registered accounts increased from 2.500.000 users to roughly 4.300.000 - about 🎉 <span class="u-emphasize">1.800.000</span> newcomers explored Fediverse networks!

Five networks growing most rapidly in *online* server numbers in 2019 were:

![Pleroma +182 servers, Mastodon +159, WriteFreely +147, Pixelfed +73, PeerTube +63](/en/post/fediverse-in-2019/top-growing.jpg)

Three other Fediverse platforms that expanded significantly in 2019:

• [Misskey](/en/misskey) 🎉 +37 servers

• [Plume](https://joinplu.me) 🎉 +23 servers

• [Funkwhale](/en/funkwhale) 🎉 +15 servers


*Please, note: these numbers are an approximation based on statistics voluntarily provided by server administrators. Highly volatile (servers go offline / online every day), the numbers reflect only part of Fediverse at a given period of time (today!).*

• *Fediverse Conference* in Barcelona - 💡 follow the official [account](https://libertalia.world/@fediconf) for updates

• *Spoiler* from the future: millions of people discovering Fediverse networks and migrating from centralized silos. Be prepared!

### Issues to be resolved in 2020

One of the main goals of federating software is decentralizing the web. That requires many Fediverse servers each having a small number of users, hosting data in physically decentralized manner. That's the ideal, a perfect image.

![Illustration of many small interconnected stars](/en/post/fediverse-in-2019/ideal.jpg)

But in real world most people register on large Fediverse servers with thousands of users: they're popular, more stable and reliable, their friends are there. And server administrators tend to choose large, well-known hosting solutions: they're cheaper, more stable and reliable. This leads to a situation where 80% of total users are all crowded on 10 large ("flagship") instances, and 40% of all servers are hosted mainly by 5 companies.

![Illustration of two huge (fat) servers talking to each other](/en/post/fediverse-in-2019/de-burp-lization.jpg)

Most used providers 2019:

![list of most used hosting providers](/en/post/fediverse-in-2019/providers.jpg)

You can see Mastodon statistics on [servers](http://sp3r4z.fr/mastodon/general) and [providers](http://sp3r4z.fr/mastodon/providers). A representation of all Fediverse hosting providers may be found [here](https://fediverse.network/servers). The situation hasn't changed much since 2018 Leah's [research](https://chaos.social/@leah/99837391793032137) on server distribution. Will something change in 2020?

### Fediverse.party news:
