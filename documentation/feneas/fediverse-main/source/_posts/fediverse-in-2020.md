**Happy 2021, fedizens!**

One more year in Fediverse passed. Let's have a look at what we have achieved in 2020.

### Fediverse in numbers

The number of servers grew from 5.027 last year to ~5.900 by the end of 2020. That's <span class="u-emphasize">about 900</span> new instances.

The number of registered users, on the other hand, has decreased and by the end of the year remains slightly above 4.000.000. This may be due to the fact that several large servers went down during the year, and because some administrators periodically remove long inactive accounts to free up space for newcomers.

Whatever the reason, we may rejoice that more small instances keep appearing. That's what Fediverse is supposed to be doing – decentralizing!

Seven networks growing most rapidly in *online* server numbers in 2020 were:

• [PeerTube](/en/peertube) 🎉 +320 servers

• [Mastodon](/en/mastodon) 🎉 +237 servers

• [Pleroma](/en/pleroma) 🎉 +224 servers

• [WriteFreely](https://github.com/writefreely/writefreely) 🎉 +74 servers

• [Misskey](/en/misskey) 🎉 +58 servers

• [Mobilizon](https://framagit.org/framasoft/mobilizon) 🎉 +45 servers

• [Pixelfed](/en/pixelfed) 🎉 +40 servers

*Note: these numbers are an approximation based on statistics voluntarily provided by server administrators. Servers go offline / online every hour, every day, so the numbers reflect only part of Fediverse at the time this article was published.*
