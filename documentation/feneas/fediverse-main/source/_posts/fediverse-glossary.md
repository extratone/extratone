[Peter Gossner](https://pleroma.tilde.zone/users/petegozz) wrote an extensive Fediverse tech [glossary](https://tilde.town/%7Epetegozz/Fediverse_Glossary). Here's the **Dedication** excerpt:

    "For Artists and Hackers, Academics, and Admins.
     For Humans who Grok stuff. Those self taught, and persistent.
     For those who build for Us: Tools to own and run.
     For People in Community: Who will not be a Commodity,
     For Our Internet, And all who sail on her.
     Useful may it be. Save time may it much".
