     &lt;a href=&quot;/news/let-us-meet-on-socialhub.html&quot;&gt;SocialHub launched&lt;/a&gt;.
     This has been a successful community-run resource for discussing
     ActivityPub development and its future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since that time, a number of updates have been requested and suggested
     of this site.
     After significant delays (sorry), the frontpage of
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://activitypub.rocks/&quot;&gt;activitypub.rocks&lt;/a&gt;
     now
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/activitypub.rocks/-/commit/391cfae9d208eddb51b21c06032307f8f45d9c35&quot;&gt;better reflects&lt;/a&gt;
     the community-hosted resources where ActivityPub-oriented
     advancement and development have been happening.
     In particular, the link to the test suite, which has been down for
     ages (yes, sorry, we know),
     now instead points to the most excellent
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://test.activitypub.dev/&quot;&gt;test.activitypub.dev&lt;/a&gt;.
     Massive thank you to
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://mastodon.technology/@cj&quot;&gt;cj&lt;/a&gt;
     of
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://go-fed.org/&quot;&gt;go-fed&lt;/a&gt;
     for providing this excellent and much-needed resource.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ActivityPub has come a long way since the days when this website
     first launched... at that time, the primary focus of this website
     was advocacy for the hope that ActivityPub would become a
     W3C-recommended standard.
     We're well past those days now... the ActivityPub community is a
     flourishing one, with many implementations and more interest and
     users than ever.
     Today's update makes a few small updates to better reflect such
     changing reality, and we hope to do so more moving forward.
     At the same time, we're also happy that this website had to be
     updated to point to many external, community-oriented resources...
     a sign of a healthy community.
     May the future of ActivityPub be as bright as its present!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Let us meet on SocialHub!</title><author><name>hellekin</name></author><updated>2019-12-26T17:46:00+0500</updated><link href="/news/let-us-meet-on-socialhub.html" rel="alternate" /><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In case you missed the latest and hottest in the ActivityPub
     community, for a few months we have revived the
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/?u=how&quot;&gt;SocialHub&lt;/a&gt;
     where developers, implementors, and anyone interested in the present
     and future of the W3C Recommendation gather, discuss issues, and
     collaborate with a kind and cooperative spirit to bring forth the
     best of what our collective intelligence can invent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new SocialHub, like the previous one we had to abandon, runs
     Discourse, a forum software that can be used via email, but shines
     on the web, and is
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/software/discourse?u=how&quot;&gt;about to implement ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;
     support!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are implementing ActivityPub-compatible software, you're
     very welcome to

     to give your project visibility and point potential contributors
     to your own community's online resources (repositories, blog,
     forum, etc.). You can even use a subcategory dedicated to your
     software implementation to discuss ActivityPub-specific details
     with other developers for interoperability with your software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Non-technical people are also welcome! There's a lot to discuss,
     study, and invent in the growing Fediverse that has no equivalent in
     the surveillance capitalist counter-part that we're escaping from.
     Our
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/fediversity?u=how&quot;&gt;#Fediversity&lt;/a&gt;
     welcomes researchers, social scientists, journalists, and collectives interested
     in adopting ActivityPub for their own needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We're also discussing how to
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/discussing-the-evolution-of-the-activitypub-rocks-site/142?u=how&quot;&gt;make this site more useful&lt;/a&gt;

     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;
     is
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/6785&quot;&gt;now a W3C Recommendation&lt;/a&gt;!
     Thank you and congratulations to the many, many people involved
     in this standardization effort.
     We couldn't have done it without you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now comes the fun part... building ActivityPub applications!

     &lt;a href=&quot;/news/activitypub-reaches-cr.html&quot;&gt;reaching Candidate Recommendation status&lt;/a&gt;
     we're pleased to announce that
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;
     has now reached
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsPR&quot;&gt;Proposed Recommendation status&lt;/a&gt;!
     (We actually moved to Proposed Recommendation status
      &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-activitypub-20171205/&quot;&gt;on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;
      but... sometimes getting out news is a slow process.)
     This means that as far as the
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/&quot;&gt;Social Working Group&lt;/a&gt;
     is concerned, the group is confident that ActivityPub is ready to
     become a real specification.
     Now we wait and cross our fingers for the W3C Membership and W3C
     Management to approve.
     Assuming all goes well, that would mean moving to
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsPR&quot;&gt;Recommendation status&lt;/a&gt;
     sometime over the next couple of months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the meanwhile we're seeing the number of
     &lt;a href=&quot;/implementation-report/&quot;&gt;implementations of ActivityPub to be growing&lt;/a&gt;.
     What exciting new ActivityPub-using projects are on the horizon?
     We hope to see you submit your implementation to the implementation
     reports page next!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Test suite up, implementation reports page up... let's get more reports in!</title><author><name>Christopher Lemmer Webber</name></author><updated>2017-11-06T00:00:00+0500</updated><link href="/news/test-suite-running-and-impl-reports-page-up.html" rel="alternate" /><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I'm happy to announce that the
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://test.activitypub.rocks/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub test suite&lt;/a&gt;
     is up and running.
     Likewise, so is the
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/&quot;&gt;implementation reports page&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, these go hand in hand.
     If you go through the test suite, it'll generate an
     implementation report that you can easily submit.
     At the time of writing we have three implementation reports up,
     but we could really use more!
     Are you working on an ActivityPub implementation?
     Please submit one!
     Not only does it help ActivityPub get through the last leg of
     its standards process (we need to wrap up over the next few weeks!)
     but don't you want to look cool by showing up as an implementation
     on the
     &lt;a href=&quot;/implementation-report/&quot;&gt;implementation reports page&lt;/a&gt;?
     ;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Note that it's perfectly acceptable to incrementally submit
     reports... if it turns out that your implementation doesn't
     pass as many items on the implementation report as you'd like,
     it's okay to re-submit later.
     (At the time of writing, my own implementation Pubstrate has
     a number of items marked as not passing that I'll be getting
     passing over the next few weeks!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One note is that the test suite has two components: some of
     the tests are automated, and some of them prompt the user to
     manually test something and confirm/deny that it is passing.
     We would like to have full automated coverage in the future,
     but the working group agreed that since time is limited and
     interoperability is already being demonstrated externally
     through federation etc, this would be good enough for now.
     But it would be good to get more automated!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anyway,
     we're in the last mile of getting ActivityPub out the door.
     And if you're an implementer, you can help us get there.
     Submit implementation reports, and help us, the world,
     ActivityPub's standardization effort, and your project's own
     vanity by getting an implementation report up there!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Mastodon launches their ActivityPub support, and a new CR!</title><author><name>Christopher Lemmer Webber</name></author><updated>2017-09-10T00:00:00+0500</updated><link href="/news/mastodon-ap-and-new-cr.html" rel="alternate" /><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Greetings!
     Big news this week, from multiple directions!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Mastodon and ActivityPub, together at last!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all,
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://joinmastodon.org/&quot;&gt;Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;
     has
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://hackernoon.com/mastodon-and-the-w3c-f75f376f422&quot;&gt;launched version 1.6 with ActivityPub support&lt;/a&gt;!
     This is a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; piece of news.
     While Mastodon is not the first implementer of ActivityPub, they
     are by far the largest existing implementation, with approximately
     850k registered users.
     We're excited to have them on board!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;A new Candidate Recommendation!&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week we published a
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/CR-activitypub-20170907/&quot;&gt;new Candidate Recommendation&lt;/a&gt;
     (aka &amp;quot;CR&amp;quot;) of
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/&quot;&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt;.
     This release contains two major changes:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#follow-activity-inbox&quot;&gt;Follow&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
          requests are now explicitly replied to with either an
          &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#accept-activity-inbox&quot;&gt;Accept&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
          or
          &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#reject-activity-inbox&quot;&gt;Reject&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;publicInbox&lt;/code&gt;
          is now renamed to
          &lt;code&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#shared-inbox-delivery&quot;&gt;sharedInbox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
          and in addition to being used for distributing and reading public
          posts, it may also be used to deliver posts to followers to reduce
          the number of HTTP requests made on followers-only posts between federated
          servers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;These changes are normative, so update your implementations!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Candidate Recommendation is the period in which we try to
     stabilize the standard and get enough implementation to make it to
     Recommendation status.
     We don't take normative changes lightly, but sometimes we such changes
     are found to be necessary in this stage... in this case, we found that
     both of these changes were necessary for Mastodon, and projects the
     size of Mastodon, to adopt ActivityPub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What's next?&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;We've quietly launched the
     &lt;a href=&quot;https://test.activitypub.rocks/&quot;&gt;test suite&lt;/a&gt;...
     very quietly, because not all test suite functionality is added yet!
     Only the &amp;quot;client-to-server server&amp;quot; section is yet working.
     However, we're working on the rest of it and hope to have it up
     sometime within the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's it for now.
     Happy implementing, everyone!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>New tutorial, new logo!</title><author><name>Christopher Lemmer Webber</name></author><updated>2017-05-09T15:10:00+0500</updated><link href="/news/new-tutorial-new-logo.html" rel="alternate" /><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A

     &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/blob/gh-pages/implementation-reports/TEMPLATE.md&quot;&gt;open for implementation report submissions&lt;/a&gt;!
     In order for ActivityPub to transition from being a Candidate Recommendation
     to being a Proposed Recommendation, we need submissions showing that people
     are using the standard, and help identifying which features are used.
     (Filling in the implementation report has an added bonus: alongside
              following the standard, it's a helpful checklist to make sure
              you're implementing all the things you meant to!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you to
     &lt;a href=&quot;http://bengo.is/&quot;&gt;Benjamin Goering&lt;/a&gt;
     for adding the implementation report template, which has helped
     tremendously!
     You rock, bengo!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's coming next?
     The test suite should be out as soon as possible!
     So if you start implementing now, you'll be able to run against
     the test suite very shortly!&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>ActivityPub reaches Candidate Recommendation status!</title><author><name>Christopher Lemmer Webber</name></author><updated>2016-11-17T00:00:00+0500</updated><link href="/news/activitypub-reaches-cr.html" rel="alternate" /><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're thrilled to announce that
