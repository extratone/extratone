    <title>Using ActivityPub for Podcast Comments (exploration)</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/using-activitypub-for-podcast-comments-exploration/1909</link>
    <description>Dear ActivityPub community!

I&#39;m somewhat active in the Podcasting 2.0 community. This community works on the **Podcast Namespace**, which extends the RSS standard with new tags for podcasts. For example the `podcast:person` tag (to identify individuals heard in the podcast, both presenters and guests), or the `podcast:funding` tag (to indicate ways to financially support the podcaster). Podcast hosts should support them; podcast apps should use them.

The loose group is now also discussing **comments** (via a `podcast:comments` tag), and one venue that is being explored is ActivityPub.

The goal here is a YouTube-comment-like-experience. But then in some decentralised fashion. I see some open questions regarding
* hosting (where are the comments hosted; by podcast host, podcaster, podcast client app, or another specialised comment entity)
* moderation (should probably be the responsibility of the podcaster, but this depends on who hosts the comments)
* inclusion (should comments be gathered through a hashtag of some sorts, or is there a single thread that is displayed)
* initiation (who gets to &#39;start&#39; a comment thread, and who has control over this (client app, podcaster, no-one))
* technology (should we rely on Mastodon, or create a &#39;new&#39; ActivityPub-based standard specific to comments? If something new, in which ways should it federate?)

Adam &amp; Dave (who basically initiated the Podcasting 2.0 community) are discussing  the comments concept here - I would recommend listening to it because it probably gives a better idea than my summary above:
&gt; [Podcasting 2.0](https://podcastindex.org/podcast/920666): Episode 44: Separating the Nodes from the Noobs
&gt; https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/PC20-44-2021-07-02-Final.mp3#t=5617 [01:33:37]

**It would be great if the ActivityPub community could chip in.** Every 1,5 week or so there&#39;s a community developer meeting, and the first next one is Wednesday 7 July at 20:00 CEST. I&#39;m pretty sure that Podcast Comments will be on the agenda for that meeting.

If you prefer to chip in on Mastodon, there&#39;s a discussion thread here:

Would be great to hear from you :)</description>

I highly, highly recommend you and other interested members of Podcastindex join our community, and I hereby invite you to become members. An issue on the fediverse that we need to overcome is dispersed development of ActivityPub-related interoperability projects, where valuable knowledge and insights continue to be stuck in 'siloed' federated app projects, and specification initiatives like yours.

On SocialHub we can be stronger together (see also the [Spiral Island analogy](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/socialhub-and-spiral-island-a-fediverse-foundation-analogy/1543)), and various podcasting projects have either already joined (e.g. [Castopod](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/software/castopod/63)) or shown interest to join our community. Other media platforms like Peertube and Owncast are also participating.

---

PS. As feedback to this repo I'd like to recommend adding some more related links and explainer text to the README and to consider adding a license document (even though this repo may be meant as temp workspace). Some repo topic labels for findability would be great too (e.g. 'activitypub', 'podcasting', 'specification', etc.)

PS2. As you will close this issue at certain time, maybe you'd consider mentioning SocialHub community forum in the README. Podcasting related topics can be marked with the `#podcasting` forum tag.</span></p>

    <pre><code class="lang-md"># The Podcast ActivityStream

&gt; Version 1.0 by Yassine Doghri - 2021.04.15

The document aims to explain through examples and namespace definition how the existing RSS specification could be interfaced to [ActivityPub](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/).

This is meant as a complementary work to the existing [RSS podcast namespace specification](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace) whilst unlocking features offered by the ActivityPub protocol.

## Context

A Podcast show is essentially constituted of two entities. In the RSS specification, these are placed under the `&lt;channel&gt;` and `&lt;item&gt;` tags. The `&lt;channel&gt;`, referring to the Podcast, may include multiple `&lt;item&gt;` tags which are the Podcast episodes.

[The ActivityPub protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub) is a decentralized social networking protocol based upon the [ActivityStreams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) data format. This offers a base vocabulary for social interactions between decentralized servers and allows us to extend it for podcasting.

The syntax for defining the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format is called [JSON-LD](https://json-ld.org/), a method of encoding linked data using JSON.

Just as the RSS specification, the **Podcast ActivityStream** defines two entities:

- [Podcast Actor](#the-podcast-object)
- [PodcastEpisode Object](#the-podcastepisode-object).

            <p>The way commenting works in ActivityPub is that someone creates an object, for example a Note, and others reply to it by referencing it in the <code>inReplyTo</code> field in their notes. So it makes sense that each podcast is an actor, and each episode is an object created by that actor that people can comment on.</p>
<p>You do need a server application of some sort for ActivityPub — no getting around that. It could be very barebones, but it at the very least needs to support other actors following yours and then sending activities out to followers. In your case it would also need to store the list of comments (replies) and return them in the <code>replies</code> collections.</p>

<p>ActivityPub requires a degree of dynamic behaviors (delivery, processing incoming peer data, etc) that is far above and beyond what RSS requires, so there’s some sunk cost to adoption that may act as a barrier.</p>
<p>Where ActivityPub starts to shine is when you have to come up with the next thing to implement, after solving comments, plus how you want such software to interact with the greater web. If you need the flexibility that ActivityPub provides and have already paid the sunk cost and want other app writers to potentially integrate, then it starts to pay off dividends. If you just want a quick win for a one-off feature and less engineering work and don’t care about wider ecosystem interactions, it’s less appealing.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, the choice of whether to adopt AP is more philosophically about how one views growing an ecosystem – a question I can’t answer for others.</p>
<p>Note, at the time of this writing I haven’t listened to the Podcast in the OP.</p>

            <p>Dear ActivityPub community!</p>
<p>I’m somewhat active in the Podcasting 2.0 community. This community works on the <strong>Podcast Namespace</strong>, which extends the RSS standard with new tags for podcasts. For example the <code>podcast:person</code> tag (to identify individuals heard in the podcast, both presenters and guests), or the <code>podcast:funding</code> tag (to indicate ways to financially support the podcaster). Podcast hosts should support them; podcast apps should use them.</p>
<p>The loose group is now also discussing <strong>comments</strong> (via a <code>podcast:comments</code> tag), and one venue that is being explored is ActivityPub.</p>
<p>The goal here is a YouTube-comment-like-experience. But then in some decentralised fashion. I see some open questions regarding</p>
<ul>
<li>hosting (where are the comments hosted; by podcast host, podcaster, podcast client app, or another specialised comment entity)</li>
<li>moderation (should probably be the responsibility of the podcaster, but this depends on who hosts the comments)</li>
<li>inclusion (should comments be gathered through a hashtag of some sorts, or is there a single thread that is displayed)</li>
<li>initiation (who gets to ‘start’ a comment thread, and who has control over this (client app, podcaster, no-one))</li>
<li>technology (should we rely on Mastodon, or create a ‘new’ ActivityPub-based standard specific to comments? If something new, in which ways should it federate?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Adam &amp; Dave (who basically initiated the Podcasting 2.0 community) are discussing  the comments concept here - I would recommend listening to it because it probably gives a better idea than my summary above:</p>

<p><strong>It would be great if the ActivityPub community could chip in.</strong> Every 1,5 week or so there’s a community developer meeting, and the first next one is Wednesday 7 July at 20:00 CEST. I’m pretty sure that Podcast Comments will be on the agenda for that meeting.</p>

1) We plan on using ActivityPub for comments.  This already exists and works.  That's ActivityPub (Mastodon style).  Just taking time to get to help with implementation details, we're catching up on other things.
2) I'm like you, Adam,...</p>
