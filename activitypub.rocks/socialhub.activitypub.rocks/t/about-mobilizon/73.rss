[Mobilizon](https://joinmobilizon.org) is software that, once installed on a server, will create a website where people can create events, similar to Facebook events or MeetUp.

Although it can be used to organize a simple birthday party or a karate competition, Mobilizon will be developed to meet the needs of activists, who require specific tools to organize themselves in an autonomous and sustainable way.</description>
