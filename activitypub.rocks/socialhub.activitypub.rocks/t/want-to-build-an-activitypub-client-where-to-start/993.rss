    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/want-to-build-an-activitypub-client-where-to-start/993</link>
    <description>I&#39;d like to build an ActivityPub client, but to start off I feel that I need to define a Minimum Viable Product. What&#39;s the absolute minimum a client needs, in order to follow an Actor and receive posts? Do I need to start by implementing OAuth2?</description>

            <p>FYI, I have a small ActivityPub client demo as a part of my Inbox app. You can try it here: <a href="https://whyineedtofillusername.github.io/inbox/pleroma" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://whyineedtofillusername.github.io/inbox/pleroma</a>.</p>
<p>It only allows to login to Pleroma instance and list you statuses.

<p>Thanks, I’m getting further. When I try yours, it works.<br>
Now I tried Pleroma “<a href="https://pleroma.site/nokton" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://pleroma.site/nokton</a>”, that response “To use Pleroma, please enable JavaScript.” So I tried <a href="https://toot.whatever.cz/@nokton" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://toot.whatever.cz/@nokton</a>, there I have a better success as I receive the profile’s JSON, however it does not have the OAuth reg. endpoint defined. In your code:</p>
<pre><code>const regEndpoint = user.endpoints.oauthRegistrationEndpoint;
</code></pre>
<p>And my JSON:</p>
<pre><code>{
  "@context": [
    "https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams",
    "https://w3id.org/security/v1",
...
  "endpoints": {
    "sharedInbox": "https://toot.whatever.cz/inbox"
  }
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I tried it with the “user” path: <a href="https://greenish.red/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://greenish.red/</a><strong>users</strong>/nokton and finally I got it!</p>
<p>So thank you very much, now I’ll be working on replicating this in my app.</p>

            <p>Wow, that was quick, thank you!</p>
<p>However, I am sorry but I don’t understand how to use it. What should go to the login? From the source code I think it should be some kind of URL with login? I tried bunch of stuff, but didn’t figure it out.</p>

            <p>Pleroma <em>provides</em> AP C2S, it doesn’t have any application/frontend other than AndStatus (which sadly I don’t use as I don’t have android).</p>
<p>I’m slowly building a Qt/QML application (QtMobile-oriented but should work fine on desktop as well) that does AP C2S, yet to publish it as I’d rather freely experiment with the design of it before doing that.</p>
<p>As for the documentation, it’s quite WIP and we don’t have much things other than:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some additionnal actor endpoints: <a href="https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/ap_extensions/#actor-endpoints" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://docs-develop.pleroma.social/backend/ap_extensions/#actor-endpoints</a>
</li>
<li>A subset of ActivityPub with some transformations, yet to see how to document that properly</li>

            <p>Actually, what’s your intended time frame on this?</p>
<p>I changed my scope to write a server instead of a client, because I realized I’m more comfortable on the backend. My pace is slow. I’ve implemented webfinger (still looking at the Actor Object and figuring out what I want in it) so far. Next step is HTTP signatures, so I can start communicating with the rest of the fediverse. After that comes inboxes, I guess.</p>

            <p>Hi, I would like to share the effort and start building a basic AP client as well. Is there a list of AP servers that support the Client-to-Server API of AP?</p>
<p>I was going through the list at <a href="https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/">https://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/</a>, but obviously that list is old, since you mention that Pleroma does support it. I want to use Angular, without my server if possible.</p>

            <p>Please note that “Web-based” client doesn’t necessarily mean that the client cannot have its own server-side, including server-side (“cloud-based”) storage…<br>
Moreover, having such a server-side will allow to reuse a lot of existing code of client apps. Literally! Just add to it an embedded http server for Web access…</p>
<p>This could also be not only JVM-running code (in Java or Kotlin) that Android Open Source apps use, but also a native Linux app compiled e.g. using Kotlin native. Why not, if you are creating a new app?!</p>

            <p>If OAuth sounds quite complex to you, you could start with HTTP Basic (Pleroma supports both) at first just to test that the rest will be working but I wouldn’t use HTTP Basic other than for testing/debugging if you store tokens.</p>
<p>As for storing tokens on the client side, you could use the LocalStorage API if you use JavaScript.</p>

            <p>Regarding OAuth I agree, you can do nothing before you successfully authenticated at a server.</p>
<p>I also think that Web-based client (even if it’s a “frontend” of a collocated ActivtyPub server) should ideally use the same interface to the server as any other client app.<br>
So authentication on the Web client can be unrelated to authentication on the ActivtyPub server. Just like we unlock smartphone in order to use mobile device-based client app that, in its turn, authenticates at several ActivtyPub servers in a different way…</p>

            <p>My client will be web-based, which poses a kinnda weird (to me, at least) situation: it should itself be protected by a login, while also logging in to one or more servers…</p>
<p>Maybe I’m being impractical here. What I want to do is a frontend, but I assumed that a frontend would be the same thing as a client if it’s going to be compatible with several backends. I may be mistaken there.</p>
<p>But I take it the OAuth thing is pretty much the first thing I need to implement either way…</p>

            <p>I’d like to build an ActivityPub client, but to start off I feel that I need to define a Minimum Viable Product. What’s the absolute minimum a client needs, in order to follow an Actor and receive posts? Do I need to start by implementing OAuth2?</p>
