    <title>Lemmy Federation Alpha Version</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/lemmy-federation-alpha-version/632</link>
    <description>We are happy to announce that we have finished the initial version of our ActivityPub implementation. At the moment, it can only federate a limited set of data, like communities, users and posts, but not comments or votes. So this initial version is mainly interesting for those who are familiar with the ActivityPub protocol, and those who would like to contribute to Lemmy.

These are our test instances, Be aware that they are not permanent, and we might wipe the data at any time. Federation uses a whitelist for now, until we are confident that the implementation is secure.

If you are interested in contributing to the development, check out [this issue](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues/647) and the [dev instructions](https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/docs/contributing_federation_development.html). Please use [the issue tracker](https://github.com/LemmyNet/lemmy/issues) to report bugs, so that we can keep everything organized.

We also want to give a huge thanks to [Aode](https://asonix.dog/@asonix), whose [ActivityStreams library](https://git.asonix.dog/Aardwolf/activitystreams) and advice have helped us immensely.

If you like what we are doing, please consider donating towards Lemmy development. Besides [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/Lemmy/) and [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/dessalines), we are also on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/lemmy) now. Donations are a big help for us, because they allow us to spend more time to work on Lemmy, instead of selling our labour to a company just to pay for rent and other necessities.

<p>This is our bad, I’m realizing this should be the Accept header, not Content-Type.</p>

            <p>Oops I messed up a bit there. You can get the json with the header <code>content-type: application/activity+json</code> for now.</p>

            <p>Out of curiosity, I tried fetching AP actors for the <a href="https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/c/main" rel="nofollow noopener">https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/c/main</a> community and the <a href="https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/u/nutomic" rel="nofollow noopener">https://enterprise.lemmy.ml/u/nutomic</a> user, but both these URLs return (very compact) HTML pages regardless of the <code>Accept</code> header. There’s no <code>&lt;link rel="alternate"&gt;</code> either. The only federation-related thing I was able to use is nodeinfo.</p>
<p>Anyway, how do I get those actors?</p>
