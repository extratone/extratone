&lt;br&gt;

You  üíñ  love Fediverse, right? It&#39;s vibrant unique culture and the lovely people you meet. You want to protect it, increase its beauty, see more applications interoperate seamlessly. You know that you are part of a &#39;reimagining of social networking&#39; that is much needed, as traditional social media are destroying the fabric of society.

What you may not know is that:

- The Fediverse is still incredibly weak. That it has a tiny community of technologists that evolve it, and that this process is stalling as people are absorbed in their own projects. (&quot;The Tragedy of the Grassroots Movement?&quot;)

- That what Fediverse currently offers is just the tiny tip of the iceberg. That humongous potential still lies dormant, waiting to be explored. That we can go _way_ beyond microblogging features that dominate the fedi now.

- That YOU are instrumental in tapping this potential, and that you don&#39;t have to be a techie to help with that.

At [SocialHub community](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks) we come together to improve the Fediverse, evolve its standards and the ecosystem. And regardless of your skills and expertise we need all the help we can get to move forwards, to progress this thing we love.

Throw off your individualism and become a fedi builder. It&#39;s a win-win for all. We are &#39;United in Diversity&#39; and should build together. Join SocialHub as member and interact. And also join [Fediverse Futures on Lemmy](https://lemmy.ml/c/fediversefutures) to brainstorm on exciting ideas.

We are [Spiral Island](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/socialhub-and-spiral-island-a-fediverse-foundation-analogy/1543) still, and can become a sprawling archipelago.</description>
