    <title>Are there any C2S libraries which work with S2C in Pleroma?</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/are-there-any-c2s-libraries-which-work-with-s2c-in-pleroma/587</link>
    <description>I&#39;m told that Pleroma now has AP C2S support in addition to its Mastodon API support.

Are there any libraries that support this? I&#39;m told that there are a few pioneering apps like Tusky which support it, but I&#39;m looking for a library.</description>

            <p>Are you sure for Tusky? The only one I’m aware of doing AP C2S is AndStatus. And yeah pleroma does have AP C2S working, but it needs work, there is some rough edges and you still need MastodonAPI for most things.</p>
<p>Personally I would be quite interested in having a non-android client or library (portable java is fine though) as currently I don’t use an android (or iOS) system and writing code for this is quite out of scope for myself to do.</p>
