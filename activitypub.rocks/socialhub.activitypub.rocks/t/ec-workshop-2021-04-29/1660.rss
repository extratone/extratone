    <description>Continuing the discussion from [EC - NGI0 Liaison -- Webinars and Workshop April 2021](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/ec-ngi0-liaison-webinars-and-workshop-april-2021/1539):

# Preparing the wokshop

- [x] Access server
- [x] Set up server

## Access server

In order to participate in the workshop it would be useful that attendants provide a public SSH key in advance (e.g., the `id_ed25519.pub` from running `ssh-keygen -t ed25519`.

Please send a private message to @how. Number of keys received: 2

### SSH configuration:

```
# demo
Host demo.activitypub.eu
     HostName          159.69.23.59
     CheckHostIP       yes
     Port              22
     User              workshop
     IdentityFile      ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
     LogLevel          info
```

## Set up server

@how provisioned a machine for the workshop.

One idea would be to make this happen _during_ the workshop so that attendees can see for themselves how fast it can be.

workshop@demo:~$ cat README

Welcome to the ActivityPub workshop!

By the end of the workshop, the following sites should be running:

- Drupal with ActivityPub support:
  https://drupal.demo.activitypub.eu/
- A Peertube instance:
  https://tube.demo.activitypub.eu/
- A Mastodon instance:
  https://masto.demo.activitypub.eu/

To follow the installations, please type:

tmux attach

            <p>Will, I have to say I am really happy there was time in the workshop for the Immers demo. It was delightful and a real good addition to the more ‘mundane’ applications that people are familiar with. A great showcase of where great innovation can and will take fedi. Thank you!</p>

            <p>I think an intervention on packaging would be much better between the moment we have installed the instances and the moment we can use them. Delaying the workshop with presentation is not on my agenda.</p>
<p>After install, we can take the time to create accounts, ensure everything is OK, etc.</p>

<p>Would be great, indeed we would need someone familiar enough with NixOS to be able to give a quick rundown of how a PeerTube/Mastodon package (or service) would be able to be deployed. Will ask around and keep you updated. Let’s stick with the original plan for now.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>We might be able to get Eelco Dolstra, the original author of Nix, to do a brief introduction about the benefits of packaging (and maintaining) fediverse-tech before we kick off the workshop, so after my introduction. Mastodon is already packaged, PeerTube is on its way.</p>
<p>Also, <a class="mention" href="/u/swentel">@swentel</a> is still in between houses and does not have a stable internet connection, so he would not be able to showcase the ActivityPub-plugin.  Perhaps we can get in touch with a core contributor of Drupal, they might get it running, will let know asap.</p>

            <p>I’m on US time, so I’ll be asleep until an hour before the event. I’ve got OBS &amp; PeerTube setup to stream and save the Immers Space side of the event. I think I’ll also be able to use OBS Virtual Camera to stream the Immers Space feed into the Big Blue Button meeting as my camera feed.</p>
<p>The Immers Space room we’ll use is <a href="https://immers.link/CpbaLCn" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://immers.link/CpbaLCn</a></p>

            <p>I like the idea of starting on BBB, then those who are interested &amp; comfortable can try the immersive experience. Curious about ensuring we capture recording - if I have one PC connected to immers space and screensharing to BBB would that work, or should I sort out an independent recording option?</p>

<p>Many of them will be spectators. Actually I do not expect much presence. Most will watch the videos.<br>
So it’s better to make it attractive and fun than boring. The more the merrier I would say.</p>

            <p>Hi, the workshop is for EC if I understand it correctly.<br>
How many EC members do we expect who are interested in installing software?<br>
Don’t they rather want to see/understand what you can do with it after it is installed?<br>
Is what is going through my mind right now. But I don’t know the target audience.</p>

            <p>What happens in the workshop will be up to us. So far I received 2 SSH keys, so it’s not gonna be a monster. Most people will be watching and not touching the console.</p>
<p>My take is that we have a demand for installing 2 software : <a class="hashtag" href="/c/software/mastodon/17">#<span>software:mastodon</span></a> and <a class="hashtag" href="/c/software/peertube/27">#<span>software:peertube</span></a>.</p>
<p>We can split into two groups for installation. Once this is done, and it should take half-an-hour, we can start using one and the other and demonstrate the integration.</p>
<p>I’m also willing to install a Drupal instance so we can show that it integrates with M, but still needs work to work with P – this is to bring the discussion a bit on what are EDPS plans with regard to Drupal, since the EU uses it as their public website CMS.</p>
<p>Anyone who want to demonstrate their <a class="hashtag" href="/c/software/14">#<span>software</span></a> can do so, and I’d be happy that we use Immers.space to show that there are as many applications as you can imagine that can be built with ActivityPub support. We made a few tests yesterday with Jean-Luc Dorel from the EC and <a class="mention" href="/u/datatitian">@datatitian</a>, and Jean-Luc was pleased by this prospect. I proposed we keep the main event on the BBB until everything is in place, and then we can play among all ActivityPub implementations, including Immers Space Hub.</p>

</aside>
<p>This is not about restrictions, but about onboarding the EC, whom are main audience of this event, for a workshop where there are only 2hrs available. And what I said are mere suggestions considerations, open to any discussion, and we’ll go with whatever we decide together.</p>

            <p>Hey Arnold,</p>
<p>please note: It is just <strong>open to everyone</strong> -<br>
or as Amy wrote multiple times now also about the W3C Social CG<br>
“All welcome!”<br>
Please, again, do not try to restrict the community.</p>
<p>pukkamustard talked about openEngiadina last webinar.<br>
From my view, the EU can’t use peertube cause all their content is multilanguage and has subtitles often also when livestreaming, for parliament events always.<br>
Solid and Nextcloud were free to read the announcement.<br>
Again, everyone welcome.<br>
Cristina from XWiki had a Talk.<br>
I can contact the wordpress author too, <a href="https://workingdraft.de/435/">we made a podcast together</a> but it is a bit short note …</p>

            <p>One thing I am wondering about here…</p>
<p>On the one hand it would be really exciting to showcase something as innovative as Immers Space. But on the other hand we are making a first step in this workshop to people who are very familiar with Facebook and Twitter, and are <em>just</em> venturing to dip their toes into new technology.</p>
<p>We got very, very important feedback at the last webinar:</p>
<ul>
<li>That (non-technical) outsiders don’t understand AP/Fediverse very well, or at all, despite all information that is out there. That we need to provide a much better story to “sell” the idea of the Fediverse.</li>
<li>That people refer to “Mastodon” instead of fedi, because the project is most polished and productized. And then they still find it complex, even with its resemblance to Twitter.</li>
</ul>
<p>Immers Space is a step well-beyond traditional social media. To me it makes sense to address it in a follow-up event about Innovation and Future or something, unless maybe demo’d briefly in birds-eye overview at the end of the workshop.</p>
<p>Remember, our audience are people working in very formal organizations, invoking channels for very professional uses, atm. There was also mention in the webinar that they are not used or able to handle the more 2-directional dialog the fediverse would be excellent for (they are used to just broadcast their message out).</p>
<p>The integration of diverse, independent apps and how they interop together is the strongest case to highlight. In our last prep talk Jean-Luc Dorel mentioned the apps that receive most attention from EU/EC side currently: openEngiadina, PeerTube, Solid, Nextcloud, XWiki, Wordpress, Kazarma (and - mentioned earlier - Drupal).</p>

            <p>A friend who works at European Parliament says has has had trouble getting the audio &amp; webcam sharing working on the Hubs platform from inside their network - is there any possibility of getting one of our guests to login for a test run in advance? (or is that who the third preson in the room was when we met earlier?)</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/datatitian">@datatitian</a> it seems to be working for sound but as soon as I try sharing the camera the UI kind of freezes, I can still talk and chat, but the camera image is frozen with the buttons. We’re trying at <a href="https://hub.immers.space/Js3MWvk/qualified-secret-cosmos" class="inline-onebox">Qualified Secret Cosmos | Immers Space</a></p>
<hr>
<p>Hmmm, works now… ?? Seems to work with the VPN.</p>

            <p>I will ask Jean-Luc again, he tried once before and said “it lands well in a page asking for registration”, but I don’t know this guarantees actually joining a room would work. Will let you know.</p>
