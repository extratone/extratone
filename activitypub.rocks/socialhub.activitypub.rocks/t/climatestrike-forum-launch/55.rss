    <title>#ClimateStrike / Forum Launch</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/climatestrike-forum-launch/55</link>
    <description>Starting [date=2019-09-19 time=23:59:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Brussels&quot;] I will go on Climate Strike with my organization: our services will be shut down for one full week. As this forum is not open yet it makes not much difference whether we shut it down or not. But I&#39;m willing to leave it alone so that others can catch up and get ready for an official launch soon.

We should set a launch date so that we can announce publicly and gain traction and momentum. You&#39;re welcome to discuss this here. The #todo list still has some items...

Already some topics and categories have been posted, but so far I&#39;ve done most of the work of porting socialhub.network on my own, so I would appreciate that others chime in! Especially there are a number of groups and roles to fill as described in the **wiki** (hint hint): https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/things-to-be-done-before-announcing-the-forum/19/1.

Many thanks to you, early birds, who came from socialhub.network or from APConf.</description>
