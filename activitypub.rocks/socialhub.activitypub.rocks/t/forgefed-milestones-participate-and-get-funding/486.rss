    <title>ForgeFed milestones, participate and get funding</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/forgefed-milestones-participate-and-get-funding/486</link>
    <description>ForgeFed is getting NLNet funding. The funding is per milestone, so this is a good time to define our milestones and side projects, and get them discussed with NLNet.

Look at the **[plan](https://notabug.org/peers/forgefed/issues/87)**. Is there a task/project you&#39;d like to grab? If you do, you can get funding from NLNet for it! There&#39;s a variety of open tasks and pieces to put together :)</description>
