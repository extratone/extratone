    <title>Pointing my own domain to a shared instance via WebFinger .... it works but</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/pointing-my-own-domain-to-a-shared-instance-via-webfinger-it-works-but/1178</link>
    <description>So ... I have managed use use my custom domain and make it point to a shared instance, without hacking Mastodon 
... and, it kinda works ...

I have developed a small python app  [webfinger-proxy](https://github.com/raphaeljolivet/webfinger-proxy) to alias your own domain handles to a shared instance. 

I have setup it on my own domain [rjo.name](https://rjo.name).
The handle `testrjo@rjo.name` points to `testrjo@mamot.fr` 
See the response of the Webfinger [https://rjo.name/.well-known/webfinger?resource=testrjo@rjo.name](https://rjo.name/.well-known/webfinger?resource=testrjo@rjo.name)

I have managed to follow this account and send it private messages.
I have another account on the same shared instance, and `testrjo@mamot.fr` appears as a completely separate remote account though. 

I am not sure whether this is only on the UI or if Mastodon now have a duplicate account for this guy ... 
I would need some help from the developers to figure this out : Is the handle a primary key ? Or is it the URL ?
Can you see any have adverse effects ?
Do you think the physical migration of accounts from one instance to another would still work ?

I will continue my tests with other implementations : 
Pleroma, mobile clients, etc ....</description>
