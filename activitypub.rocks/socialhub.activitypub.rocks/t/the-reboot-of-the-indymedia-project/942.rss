We are a wide affinity group working to reboot the global indymedia network using modern federated protocols such as #activitypub. This reboot will be based on the OMN project code.
What is the OMN (Open Media Network):
The project is to shift power to the producers and consumers of media. It’s about good UI and simple empowering #KISS tools to move content, by categorising it with a grassroots folksonomy. This simple approach is balanced by shared site level syntax for the complex crew.

[Background](http://hamishcampbell.com/index.php/tag/indymedia/)
In the end it’s about bringing trust back into news.

            <p>One of the first things to do is create a good website with an overview of the project and its objectives. Above in this thread there is <em>some</em> context to your last post, but the link was also posted in the <a href="https://community.humanetech.com/t/5143">HTC</a> forum as-is without context (I edited slightly to give this context, but best-practice not to just post a link and nothing else). In the blog post the only thing describing what this is about is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you would like to help with moving away from this current world/media mess please create an account</p>
</blockquote>
<p>(And there was a certificate issue on <a href="https://indymediadev.openworlds.info/">https://indymediadev.openworlds.info/</a> but that may temporary, as now it is down. Maintenance I guess).</p>

            <p>I use <span class="hashtag">#XR</span> as an example of changing public experience - they put climatechaos into the public domain. Their way forward is limited, and shifting rapidly to liberal creareist agenders.</p>
<p>Yes, its needed, encryption in a openmedia network is a 10% encryption to 90% open. The problem for the last years is that 90% encryption to 10% open has been pushed over radical tech projects, its been a real mess.</p>
<p>Good insite about our BLANK history as a current outcome.</p>
<p>Distributed moderation is what the fedivers is doing kinda, this is the subject of the BOF group on folcsonermys and catorgorys, come talk there.</p>

            <p>This kinda covers the same as the talk <a href="https://wp.me/p9Vw7k-he" rel="nofollow noopener">https://wp.me/p9Vw7k-he</a></p>
<p>Why PGA and 4opens matter:</p>
<p>The <span class="hashtag">#4opens</span> are a kinda of constitution that keeps the “post truth world” at bay. As long as you keep the <span class="hashtag">#4opens</span> in place and respect the diversity they hold in place.</p>
<p>Its a chicken and egg issue.</p>
<p>The <span class="hashtag">#OMN</span> is a social technology held together by the <span class="hashtag">#4opens</span> that pushes into being a digital commons. What we then do with this liberated space is up to us.</p>
<p>The rebooted <span class="hashtag">#indymedia</span> project is a radical media project motivated by the <span class="hashtag">#pga</span> hallmarks that can only be built as a trust based network in this <span class="hashtag">#TAZ</span> space.</p>
<p>Wikipedia is kinda your friend, arty view of <span class="hashtag">#TAZ</span> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Autonomous_Zone" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temporary_Autonomous_Zone</a></p>
<p>And <span class="hashtag">#PGA</span> <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples%27_Global_Action" rel="nofollow noopener">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peoples'_Global_Action</a></p>
<p>The advantage of rebooting an existing mature project is that it gets round the nihilism of the new in tech.</p>
<p>Am thinking that we need to drop back to more community focused tech rather than the current individualist implementations.</p>
<p>Thinking of news rather then social networking there.</p>
<p>Ideas on what happens were choosing to federate or not becomes core to building a web of content flows. Rather than federate to everything with some blocks.</p>

            <p>I totally concur on with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The idea is to use human moderation flows as a feature to spread federation wider.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and also</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we build in automation then we will have lots of middling quality sites that are borderline useful. A signal to noise issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Less is more is a core of the project. The <a href="http://hamishcampbell.com/index.php/tag/geekproblem/">#geekproblem</a> is the desire to improve the network with better tools.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The scalability issue seems to converge with the way of life: in order to build trust and scale up moderation, you need to meet the people or at least spend quality time with them – and I think this barely comes with online-only encounters, even if online interaction makes it easier to lower prejudice<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote-3294-1" id="footnote-ref-3294-1">[1]</a></sup>. Certainly the <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/intermapping/838" class="inline-onebox">Intermapping</a> session can be a good place to mention this topic since both <a class="mention" href="/u/pukkamustard">@pukkamustard</a> and <a class="mention" href="/u/natacha">@natacha</a> relate to local-first and collective agency.</p>

<li id="footnote-3294-1" class="footnote-item">
<p>and even there, you certainly can build prejudice on the quality of expression or types of written interaction you happen to have with the person. <a href="#footnote-ref-3294-1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>

            <p>Thank you <a class="mention" href="/u/hamishcampbell">@hamishcampbell</a> for the ocean view and the clearly political content, including the opening (although I don’t have much appreciation for XR<sup class="footnote-ref"><a href="#footnote-3113-1" id="footnote-ref-3113-1">[1]</a></sup>) and the explanation of the death of Indymedia – very useful, once again, to understand social dynamics at work and the different perspectives that can diverge sometimes although they converge most of the time.</p>
<p>I appreciate the simple approach to the OMN tools: link/subscribe, moderate/flow, rollback, edit metadata, publish content. It keeps the service as simple as it can be, or as you say <strong>the project is more important for what it does not do</strong>. I share your insights on encryption: although I think it’s entirely indispensable for OPSEC, if encryption becomes the norm you cannot keep a public record, and all that historians will have to chew on in copies of Vogue and the Sears catalog: the story of the resistance will disappear from the record because all of it is encrypted.</p>
<p>The articulation of social and technical approach to OMN is also very instructive and useful. I’d be interested in talking more about distributed “moderation”, especially in the meaning of Agent-based content validation, where Agents are made of collectives of humans eventually assisted with some automated tools, but mostly to help a social, grassroots process to take place as closely as possible to the data source.</p>
<hr class="footnotes-sep">

<ol class="footnotes-list">
<li id="footnote-3113-1" class="footnote-item">
<p>I frown at XR mostly because of their lack of criticism of the concepts of “transition” (so-called ecological transition, and so-called energetic transition – which does not exist) and the forces at work behind them, or, as a friend puts it: XR? Ha! The Liberals. <a href="#footnote-ref-3113-1" class="footnote-backref">↩︎</a></p>
