    <description>Sometimes you need to reach out to someone else, anyone, for advice or support. You may do so in the dedicated #community:well-being category. This category is only available to members (users with [trust level](https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/) 2 or higher), and you may post anonymously there.

Please see https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/welcome-to-socialhub/7/1 for alternatives to posting anonymously if you need support.

When replying to this topic and any topic under the #community:well-being category, you should take extra care for using inclusive, welcoming language, and avoid impulsive reaction -- even more so than anywhere else on this forum. You are bound to community norms for civilized discourse and a decent attitude towards yourself and others.

If you cannot see the Well-Being category, that means you did not participate enough in this community to reach the required trust level. If you think this is an error, please contact @staff. You can see who&#39;s staff on the [about page](/about).</description>
