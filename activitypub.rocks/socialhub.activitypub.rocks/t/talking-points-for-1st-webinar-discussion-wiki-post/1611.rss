## Preparing topics for discussion

[quote=&quot;j8ter, post:214, topic:1507&quot;]
By the way here are some suggestions for points of discussion after the presentation:

* Methods of moderation: how to deal with misinformation and harassment
* Taking responsibility: trustworthy tech or third party privacy policy
* Beyond ‘ethical alternatives’: the possibilities of decentralized federation
* Actually interoperable: the risk of gatekeepers setting the rules

What do you think , are these rather self-explanatory?

## Please add your suggestions:

Interoperability rather technical affair for policy-focused audience, instead maybe:
- Broadcast or communicate: who is your audience and how to engage

**We have to snip the very natural urge and energy to do it better.**

The is a large part of luck and long time digging to make something that is useful and used like #activertypub - that&#39;s why it is important to focus on it and both the serendipity that brought it into being and the community that made it relevant.

I would like to not get pie in the sky with future project visions of the fedivers as this is #fahernista fluff. 

Let&#39;s hold back on filling the limited space with all the &quot;exciting&quot; new projects and keep the focus of the event on activertypub and why they should use it.</description>

            <p>Apologies, for some reason I don’t have an Edit-link or button, only Reply, which is why I’m replying and immediately ruining your idea, sorry <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"><br>
I suggest to replace the final discussion point on interoperability with something concerning possible use cases of fedi-tech for public services, something like:</p>
<pre><code>Broadcast or communicate: who is your audience and how to engage
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is more in line with the content of the webinar and the policy-focused audience.</p>
