    <title>Unit-Testing Federations (or networks in general)</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/unit-testing-federations-or-networks-in-general/1296</link>
    <description>Hello !

I&#39;ve been writing unit tests in Django and we rely quite heavily on ActivityStreams messages being sent between servers in the federation. The first solution I wrote turned out to have an infinite loop in it, because two servers were reacting to each other&#39;s messages by sending another one :grin: infinite oneupmanship

if I had a magic wand I&#39;d love to be able to write unit tests in which I had multiple servers. I haven&#39;t been able to find anything like this for Django specifically, but does anyone know of any examples in other frameworks, have any insight into the topic or any interesting reading ?</description>
