    <description>This guide is a collaboratively-edited introduction to ActivityPub and provides links to sources of more information.

## What is ActivityPub?

ActivityPub is a standard that allows different web applications to interact so that users can pool their information and collaborate across instances (websites, applications), even ones running different software.

Although only adopted as an official World Wide Web Consortium recommendation in 2018, the [ActivityPub protocol](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub) is already implemented in a significant range of projects. These include:

* Microblogging platforms like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org), [Misskey](https://joinmisskey.github.io) and [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social).
* Decentralized media hosting and sharing platforms like [Funkwhale](https://funkwhale.audio) (audio), [PeerTube](https://joinpeertube.org/en) (video), and [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org) (images).
* Blogging platforms like [Plume](https://joinplu.me) and [WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org).
* Social network platforms like [Friendica](https://friendi.ca).

ActivityPub supports common social network activities like following, liking, announcing, adding, and blocking. For example, if you have an account on a Mastodon instance like [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/about), you can follow someone on a WriteFreely instance like [Qua](https://qua.name) and receive updates whenever they have a new blog post.

### Why ActivityPub?

Christopher Lemmer Webber, one of the co-authors of ActivityPub, noted in [a post announcing the standard](https://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/victory-for-libre-networks-activitypub-is-now-a-w3c-recommended-standard):

&gt; Increasingly, much of our lives is mediated through social networks, and so network freedom in these spaces -- and thus removing central control over them -- is critical. One thing you may have noticed in the last decade is that many decentralized free software social networking applications have been written. Sadly, most of those applications can&#39;t actually speak to each other -- a fractured federation. I hope that with ActivityPub, we&#39;ve improved that situation.

### Terminology

#### Federation

In IT, [a federation is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federation_(information_technology)):

&gt; a group of computing or network providers agreeing upon standards of operation in a collective fashion.

Federation is the term used to describe the interoperability that ActivityPub and other protocols can enable between different websites running different softwares. Sites that are connected in this way are said to be *federated*.

#### Fediverse

See [Fediverse.Party](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse) for a good introduction:

&gt; It is a common name for federated social networks running on free open software on a myriad of servers across the world.

The term Fediverse includes but is not limited to applications supporting ActivityPub. There are other standards such as [diaspora](https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora_federation), [Zot](https://zotlabs.org/help/developer/zot_protocol), [OStatus](https://github.com/OStatus) and [DFRN](https://github.com/friendica/friendica/wiki/Protocol) (this list from [Fediverse.Party](https://fediverse.party/en/fediverse)).

## Resources

There&#39;s a growing set of information out there about ActivityPub and how to use it. Here are some places to look.

### Discussion, news and announcements

* The [ActivityPub Rocks site](https://activitypub.rocks) has a general intro and historical announcements.
* The [forum](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks) on ActivityPub Rocks is an active discussion site with many categories and topics.
* The [Feneas forum](https://talk.feneas.org) is &quot;a neutral place for all federated projects (and their users!) to come and discuss.&quot; It includes [ActivityPub discussion](https://talk.feneas.org/c/activitypub/6) as well as broader topics to do with the Fediverse.
* Some technical discussion related to the ActivityPub specification takes place in the [issue queue for the ActivityPub specification](https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues).
* [We Distribute](https://wedistribute.org) is &quot;a publication dedicated to Free Software, decentralized communication technologies, and sustainability&quot; with lots of Fediverse-related news.

### Conferences

#### ActivityPub Conference 2019, Prague

Extensive conference materials, including session videos, are posted on the [conference site](https://redaktor.me/apconf). This is a great place to get up to speed on current discussions and initiatives in the ActivityPub space.

#### FedConf 2020, Barcelona

A Fediverse conference will take place September 25 - 27, 2020 in Barcelona. See:

* The [conference website](https://fediconf.org).
* A [planning forum](https://talk.feneas.org/c/fediverse-conf/39).

### Introductions and overviews

* [ActivityPub, the secret weapon of the Fediverse](https://homehack.nl/activitypub-the-secret-weapon-of-the-fediverse)

https://video.writeas.org/videos/watch/cc55e615-d204-417c-9575-7b57674cc6f3

### Fediverse aggregators

Various projects that crawl, aggregate, and map the different instances that form the fediverse provide potentially valuable insights into what&#39;s currently done in ActivityPub and the other federation protocols.

#### [Fediverse network](https://fediverse.network)

#### [search.social](https://search.social)

&gt; a fediverse search engine.

#### [fediverse.space](https://www.fediverse.space)

&gt; a tool to visualize networks and communities on the fediverse. It works by crawling every instance it can find and aggregating statistics on communication between these.

#### [the-federation.info](https://the-federation.info)

Provides an opt-in listing of Fediverse instances and the software that runs them.

#### [instances.social](https://instances.social)

Offers a wizard-based interface to identify suitable Mastodon instance based on user preferences.

### Organizations

#### Feneas

[Federated Networks Association (Feneas)](https://feneas.org) is:

&gt; a non-profit volunteer organization that aims to spread knowledge about federated web projects and help people and projects involved in this area.

#### Social Web Incubator Community Group

The [Social Web Incubator Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/SocialCG) exists:

&gt; to continue and extend the development of vocabularies, formats and protocols to support the distributed / federated social web, as well as related technologies (such as anti-abuse and anti-spam techniques suitable for an open web). This group continues the work of the W3C Social Web Working Group.

<blockquote>
<p>but what if there are 100 users in that same server following User D? if user D has more people following him on that remote server it has to post in every user inbox? It wouldnt be easier to post to server inbox<br>
(why the difference between shared inbox and personal inbox?)?<br>
User D create a <strong>Note</strong> which is sent to the server inbox (where are hosted A,B,C) with a <strong>to:</strong> attr pointing to its followers, and all followers can get that object(<strong>Note</strong>) the same way as it was a local user. User D server just need to filter per unique domain of his followers, that it is to where it will send any specific activity for his followers or an specific user. It would use less band width.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>sharedInbox</code> <em>is</em> what you want there, instead of sending to each user’s inbox you send to a common one. It is called shared because ActivityPub has no concept of an instance/server/node, <code>https://example.org/users/A</code> and <code>https://example.org/users/B</code> could completely use different software.</p>
<p>I would recommend looking at other software to get an idea of how to use ActivityPub btw, in the same way that you quite need to look at other websites to see how to use HTML.<br>
For example in Pleroma/Mastodon/… an user <code>inbox</code> is <code>/users/:username/inbox</code> and the <code>sharedInbox</code> is <code>/inbox</code>.</p>
<p>And to take your example again, D sending to A, B, C would:</p>
<ul>
<li>take all their <code>sharedInbox</code> urls (if there is one, <code>inbox</code> otherwise)</li>
<li>deduplicate the urls (will likely obtain only one url as A, B, C are on the same server)</li>
<li>proceed to sending it</li>
</ul>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.<br>
I quite understand all that, but from programming point of view…its where i am struggling with inbox/outbox. Let me try to explain again…<br>
User A its following user B and C, they are all in the same server, so to get a timeline for user A, I just need to query all objects created by B and C. In this case I dont need an inbox here right. User A is also following user D in a remote server, so every time user D create a <strong>Note</strong>, it is posted to user A Inbox, but why, that will be fine if it was just user A, but what if there are 100 users in that same server following User D? if user D has more people following him on that remote server it has to post in every user inbox? It wouldnt be easier to post to server inbox(why the difference between shared inbox and personal inbox?)? User D create a <strong>Note</strong> which is sent to the server inbox (where are hosted A,B,C) with a <strong>to:</strong> attr pointing to its followers, and all followers can get that object(<strong>Note</strong>) the same way as it was a local user. User D server just need to filter per unique domain of his followers, that it is to where it will send any specific activity for his followers or an specific user. It would use less band width.</p>
<p>I hope I could be clear enough.</p>

<p>I’m not so sure in your message as it is quite confusing, but I’ll try anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li>All actors basically need an inbox for federation, follows are activities, they need to be accepted/rejected(/ignored)</li>
<li>You have an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#activity-types" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Activity(Create/Announce/…)</a> of an <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#object-types" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">Object(Note/Article/Video/…)</a> by 1+ <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/#actor-types" data-bbcode="true" rel="nofollow noopener">actor(Person/Service/Organisation)</a>
</li>
<li>To federate an Activity you send it to all the relevant(<code>to</code>/<code>cc</code>/<code>bcc</code>/<code>bto</code> and every known one with <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public</code> aka <code>as:Public</code>) actors by using their <code>inbox</code> or <code>sharedInbox</code>, the latter often reduces the number of requests to do</li>
