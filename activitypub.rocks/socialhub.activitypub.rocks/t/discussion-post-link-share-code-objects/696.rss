    <title>Discussion: Post / Link / Share Code Objects?</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/discussion-post-link-share-code-objects/696</link>
    <description>Wacky idea: add a `code` Object Type that would consist of WebAssembly [modules](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/binary/modules.html) and optional source code. The `code` Object would potentially have imports and exports, allowing a user to link together multiple `code` posts into another executable (either statically or by &quot;dynamically&quot; linking against the `code` IRI) or library.
Would really open up new avenues for experimentation and social coding taking advantage of the cool new possibilities afforded by WASM and ActivityPub.

Totally insane idea? Could be cool? Maybe even useful?</description>

            <p>Could be interesting to have for some specific uses cases but would have to avoid being too near a botnet: “Network(s) giving the ability for a minority/single-person to execute/update code without explicit consent to a large swarm of end nodes owned by other people” (which is why automatic software updates are considered botnets by some)</p>
<p>I think just using rich-text and/or attachments is enough. At least until someone has a good use case.</p>
