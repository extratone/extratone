    <title>What is Expected Behavior POSTing to Inbox?</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/what-is-expected-behavior-posting-to-inbox/1554</link>
    <description>This is more of a &quot;Server to Server to Client&quot; question, but this feels like the best place for it.

I&#39;m trying to implement very basic ActivityPub features in my [Little Library](https://github.com/Alamantus/little-library/tree/activitypub) (link to `activitypub` branch in GitHub) app that allows other accounts to `Follow` it so they can get updates in their timeline when a book is added or removed. So far, I have succeeded in `Accept`ing incoming `Follow` requests and removing followers on `Undo{Follow}` and `Delete` activities, but I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m sending my `Create` activities correctly because when I send it to the follower (my Mastodon account), it does not appear to show up in my Mastodon timeline at all.

The actual process involves running through a queue of followers and sending them the activity, but here are the most relevant lines of code in GitHub:

- [createActivity method](https://github.com/Alamantus/little-library/blob/74d6c55c244a6acb12583cb5b03e1936c0de9e5e/server.js#L363-L400) (generates the `Create{Note}` activity that is sent)
- [sendActivity method](https://github.com/Alamantus/little-library/blob/74d6c55c244a6acb12583cb5b03e1936c0de9e5e/server.js#L402-L433) (actually `POST`s the activity to the target inbox)

I&#39;m not receiving any errors or anything after sending to my Mastodon inbox, but it&#39;s not showing on my timeline like other messages. Am I missing something required to get it to show up in the follower&#39;s timeline?</description>

            <p>Oh dang if you get a chance and you’re ok with it, it would be awesome if you could check the logs! The activities would be coming from <code>https://ap2.library.alamantus.com/activitypub/actor</code> and being sent to whatever the inbox is for <code>@Alamantus@cybre.space</code> is.</p>

            <p>happy to look into the <a href="http://cybre.space">cybre.space</a> logs for you when I get a second <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>I <em>think</em> the thing you did with cc: followers should be sufficient? I’d have to look in more detail though.</p>

            <p>Really? Well that’s slightly comforting… I don’t need to include the inbox I’m sending to in the <code>to</code> or <code>cc</code> or <code>bcc</code> field or anything like that? Would it help/hurt if I did?</p>
<p>I can’t easily look at the logs because I’m testing using live instances I don’t own like cybre.space and toot.cafe, but I guess I’ll have to figure out a good way to set one up to test with huh?</p>

            <p>I’m not seeing anything obviously incorrect here, you’ll have to look at the mastodon server logs for more information</p>
