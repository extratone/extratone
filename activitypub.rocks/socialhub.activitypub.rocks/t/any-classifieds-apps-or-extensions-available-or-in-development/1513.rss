    <title>Any classifieds apps or extensions available or in development?</title>

    <description>Hi fediverse!
It seems to me like local classifieds sites are a real use case for activitypub or other fediverse protocols. Is there anything like this available or in development? I definitely like the idea of having the fediverse as a way to serve &#39;real life&#39; instead of a being distraction from it (like facebook etc.), and would also like to fight the development where the largest businesses control the market itself (often to redirect from local / second hand sales to new products from amazon etc.) I know very little about implementation of the protocol, so it might very well be that the kind of search/filtering you would need to do can&#39;t be supported though. I looked through [the list on fediverse.party](https://fediverse.party/en/miscellaneous) and couldn&#39;t seem to find any</description>

It seems to me like local classifieds sites are a real use case for activitypub or other fediverse protocols. Is there anything like this available or in development? I definitely like the idea of having the fediverse as a way to serve ‘real life’ instead of a being distraction from it (like facebook etc.), and would also like to fight the development where the largest businesses control the market itself (often to redirect from local / second hand sales to new products from amazon etc.) I know very little about implementation of the protocol, so it might very well be that the kind of search/filtering you would need to do can’t be supported though.
