    <title>How are you handling deletes / undeletes?</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/how-are-you-handling-deletes-undeletes/655</link>
    <description>@nutomic and I currently have the ability in Lemmy to delete a thing, but then undelete it, since deleting really just sets a `deleted` boolean column for the object, and all actions in Lemmy are reversible. 

In adding federated actions, we&#39;re using a Delete activitypub , which sends a tombstone to the other servers (I don&#39;t know if this is correct, maybe it should just reference the object URI?

```
Shared inbox received activity: {&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Delete&quot;,&quot;
actor&quot;:&quot;http://lemmy_beta:8550/u/lemmy_beta&quot;,&quot;object&quot;:{&quot;type&quot;:&quot;Tombstone&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;http://lemmy_beta:8550/c/trawl_4&quot;,&quot;formerType&quot;:&quot;Group
&quot;,&quot;deleted&quot;:&quot;2020-04-30T21:15:21.690553+00:00&quot;},&quot;id&quot;:&quot;http://lemmy_beta:8550/c/trawl_4/delete/7e0cdb49-1d16-47cd-8026-970e6c0945db&quot;,&quot;
@context&quot;:&quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams&quot;,&quot;to&quot;:&quot;https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams#Public&quot;,&quot;cc&quot;:&quot;http://lemmy_beta:8550/c/

```

But also, how are yall handling undeletes? Maybe `Undo` referencing the delete id?</description>

            <p>True, but I think we could avoid this problem by making the delete permanent after 24 hours or so.</p>

            <p>Tangential, but not ‘really’ deleting posts that user requested to be deleted is probably a GDPR violation.</p>
<p>We don’t handle undeletes either in Pleroma, on deletion we replace the existing object with a Tombstone and that’s it.</p>

<p>I don’t have such a concept. Deleting posts is irreversible, and deleting users is not yet implemented.</p>
<p>(even though I’m cloning VK and it does have undelete for most of the things you can delete)</p>

</aside>
<p>But why do this? The only valid kind of Delete is signed with the post author’s private key. Again, I don’t have moderation implemented (yet), but since your instance has that private key anyway, it’d make sense to sign the moderator deletions with it as well.</p>

            <p>Also, do you distinguish between posts deleted by the creator or deleted by a mod? Our current code does, but its complicated to write all that in activitypub. In general we have a lot of duplicate code…</p>
