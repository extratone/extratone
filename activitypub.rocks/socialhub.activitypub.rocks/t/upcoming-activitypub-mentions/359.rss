    <title>Upcoming: ActivityPub mentions</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/upcoming-activitypub-mentions/359</link>
    <description>We&#39;re taking our time building more interaction into WriteFreely at the moment. A full-fledged commenting system is probably a ways off. But in the meantime, we&#39;re slowly adding interactivity where it makes sense.

The first way will be with support for ActivityPub mentions. This is getting wrapped up right now here: [#195 Send out ActivityPub mentions (T627)](https://writefreely.org/pull/195), and should be in the next major release, v0.12.

We&#39;re imagining that for now, people might leverage other fediverse accounts to have conversations around their WF posts. So in my original WF post, I could include the text: &quot;Respond to this post by mentioning @matt@writing.exchange&quot;, which would actually send me a notification on Mastodon, and automatically include that handle when people reply through other microblogging platforms.

We&#39;re hoping some weird new uses will come out of this -- you might imagine mentioning a bot to trigger some kind of action, or a federated service doing an interesting thing with the post when it&#39;s mentioned. Once this feature is live we&#39;ll definitely want to hear about how it works out for everyone, and get your feedback on how we might improve it.</description>
