    <title>Where in SocialHub Can I Talk about ...?</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/where-in-socialhub-can-i-talk-about/15</link>
    <description>This is the place where you can ask where is the more appropriate place for a topic you have in mind: maybe there&#39;s already an ongoing discussion relevant to that topic, or someone can guide you to the right category.

Here&#39;s a [list of top-level categories](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/welcome-to-socialhub/7/1#list-of-top-level-categories) and their purpose.

If you&#39;re wondering about a missing category, you reached the right topic: please describe the category you have in mind and why it should be created. Each category requires one or more _hosts_ who will be in charge of organizing, facilitating, and moderating it so that it remains active, relevant, and welcoming.</description>

            <h2>Beyond ActivityPub</h2>
<p>It was suggested to me that there’s a category missing to invite non-technical talks related to ActivityPub and its milieu. Something that would be welcoming to academics, journalists, and a public curious about the purpose, history and outreach of the ActivityPub community. For example, the following topics could belong there:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/articles-about-activitypub/404" class="inline-onebox">Articles about ActivityPub</a></li>
<li><a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/twitter-to-develop-an-open-and-decentralized-standard-for-social-media/380" class="inline-onebox">Twitter to "develop an open and decentralized standard for social media"</a></li>
</ul>
