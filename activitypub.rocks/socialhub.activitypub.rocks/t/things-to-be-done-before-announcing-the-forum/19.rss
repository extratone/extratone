    <title>Things to be done before announcing the forum</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/things-to-be-done-before-announcing-the-forum/19</link>
    <description>_Moved to #uncategorized so that everyone can see it, as there&#39;s no staff yet :)_ 

Welcome to the new SocialHub, @staff member!

First, please read https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/welcome-to-socialhub/7. Please reply here so we can discuss changes...

Before we can open the forum, there are a few things to be done:

- [\*] Fix the @system user with an avatar, description, etc.
- [\*] Create the categories that we need to continue from SocialHub.network and what we discussed so far:
  - [\*] #fediversity (@fediversity.team, give to @tao)
  - [\*] #meeting
    - [\*] #meeting:socialcg
    - [\*] #meeting:fosdem2020
    - [] #meeting:fediconf (@capmisson contacted)
    - [] #meeting:apconf (post-mortem?)
  - [\*] #packaging
  - [\*] #software
    - [] See also https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/creating-a-template-for-software-implementation-categories/39
    - [] #software:foo as they come... (@software-name, @person-in-charge)
    - [\*] #software:discourse ([@discourse](/g/discourse), ?)
    - [\*] #software:funkwhale ([@funkwhale](/g/funkwhale), @agate)
    - [\*] #software:go-fed ([@go-fed](/g/go-fed), @_cj)
    - [\*] #software:mastodon ([@mastodon](/g/mastodon), @nightpool) 
    - [\*] #software:mobilizon ([@mobilizon](/g/mobilizon), @tcit)
    - [] #software:write.as ([@write.as](/g/write.as), @thebaer), 
- [\*] Fix and populate required groups
  If you see @system in https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/about, probably we need some volunteers ;)
  Some group descriptions should be updated and made more attractive.
  - https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/g?filter=hosts
  - https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/g?filter=team
- Populate @staff: 
  - who wants `root`? @how, @nightpool 
  - who wants admin? @how, @nightpool 
  - who wants moderator? @maloki
    - [\*] activitypub.hosts
    - [\*] software.hosts
    - [\*] meeting.hosts
    - [\*] fediversity.hosts
  - [\*] contact @nightpool, @how  
  - [] well-being.team
- [\*] Change ownership on all #about posts from this initial list to @system so that it does feel welcoming and collective
- [] Bootstrap topics to get the conversation started
  - [\*] About FOSDEM https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/devroom-proposal/25
  - [\*] About OCaps (@cwebber can you start a topic in #activitypub?)
  - [] About the SIG and the relation to SocialCG (Policy, in #community:socialhub-policy?)  
  - [\*] Datashards / DHT / Hashtags (in #activitypub?) 
- [\*] Restore settings to
  - [\*] default invitee trust level to 1
  - [\*] remove invite only to open public registration
  - [\*] remove logged-in required to open to the world

I did not set the right color not images because I’m on my mobile now. Will fix later. Check out messages advice for further guidance. Good to have you here.</p>

            <p><a class="mention" href="/u/maloki">@maloki</a>, would you like to post your blog somewhere?</p>
<p>You can simply paste the link to <a href="https://blogghoran.se/2019/09/23/activity-pub-its-all-connected/" rel="nofollow noopener">https://blogghoran.se/2019/09/23/activity-pub-its-all-connected/</a> in a new topic’s subject, then add a blurb in the body (but keep the link!) and change the subject field to reflect your article’s title. Otherwise someone else could refer to it. Maybe <a class="mention" href="/u/sebastian">@Sebastian</a> since you were organizing this. Maybe that’s a candidate for creating an APConf category… Whatever you think is best!</p>

<p>A good number of them are already here. The others decided to split. I guess you could try to convince them, but I would rather let them come; at least I tried and failed before. <span class="mention">@mxb</span> is MIA, <span class="mention">@dansup</span> withdrew early on from s.n and never came back; maybe try to invite them here?</p>

            <p>I guess the best is to report it to the Discourse team, describing what you would prefer, or create a plugin to fix it. Not sure how it works: it’s a rather new feature reheated to per category moderation groups.</p>
<p>Maybe it can be fixed with CSS in Customize…</p>

            <p>I think the way that sub-categories show up on that page with their own set of team members is kind of confusing—do you know if there’s a way to customize that? Went poking around in the discourse options and didn’t see one immediately</p>

            <p>Ack. So that’s actually the <a href="/g/meeting.hosts">meeting.hosts group</a>.</p>
<p>We still need some people to fill in roles in</p>
<ul>
<li>activitypub.hosts</li>
<li>community.hosts</li>
<li>software.hosts</li>
<li>well-being.team</li>
</ul>
<p>Since software.hosts is kind of repetitive and simple, I can do it, but it would be much better if someone else would be able to do it. I can write a runbook for adding new software and teams.</p>
<p><a class="mention" href="/u/sebastian">@Sebastian</a> could you ping Chris and  Serge so they register and start the topic they’re supposed to bring about OCAP and Datashards?</p>

<p>At <a href="https://redaktor.me/apconf" rel="nofollow noopener">APConf</a>, in the community session, we discussed the relation between this forum, the SocialCG, and the W3C in general. People familiar with the W3C processes suggested that the correct term to use when referring to a group that is part of a larger Community Group would be called a Special Interest Group. The attention was to not hijack the SocialCG, while still provide a dedicated space for ActivtyPub-relevant conversation.</p>

<p>I tried editing the wiki, but I got the error “you can only mention 10 users in a post”. I’d like to have root, admin and be on the contact email for bus-factor reasons, and to share the maintenance load. I’m also down to volunteer for the <code>activitypub.hosts</code> group, although the category description mentions a “ActivityPub SIG”, and I’ve never heard of that—i’d like to understand what it is before volunteering for it <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
<p>The groups page also has a SocialCG group but there’s no corresponding item in the Wiki—I’m happy to volunteer for that as well.</p>

            <p>Would you find another team member who would “own” that post? The idea is that your team handles it so that you can makes relevant changes whenever you like. In the meantime I’ll give it to the system user.</p>

            <p>That makes sense, but i’m not prepared to be the “public face” of Mastodon in that way here, and I don’t think I should be the topic owner. I’m not here in a public relations capacity, only in a federation and interoperability capacity. Please remove my name from the topic. (Although i’m happy to have the Mastodon icon and the Mastodon team badge).</p>

            <p>I guess people who come here will be one of:</p>
<ul>
<li>existing ActivityPub developers</li>
<li>interested developers</li>
<li>prospecting sysadmins</li>
<li>interested Fediverse users and community managers</li>
<li>investors/funders, Press, random people</li>
</ul>
<p>I would imagine an “id card” that would include:</p>
<ul>
<li>what the software is about</li>
<li>language and license info</li>
<li>a bit of branding</li>
<li>team info</li>
<li>where is:
<ul>
<li>the source code</li>
<li>documentation</li>
<li>communication channels including security reports and announcement feeds</li>
<li>community norms</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Others might want to keep an announcement topic – actually, I’m waiting for the moment when you can federate your announcement feed here <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <p>Ah, you’re right, I missed that topic. Although I’m still not sure I understand the value of an “identification card”? Who’s the intended audience?</p>

            <p>As a piece of general feedback: this seems like a lot of to-do items. I think getting feedback earlier is better, and the social cg community feels like it would be better served by a less-fully-polished forum <em>now</em> rather then a more polished forum <em>later</em>. Also this just seems like a lot of structure and I think it just makes more sense to build some of these things out (groups, teams, etc) once there’s a need for them.</p>
<p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>I’m also happy to volunteer for moderator or admin positions as necessary to help shepherd things, chris and gargron and others can vouch for me, or any of the users on the mastodon servers I co-admin: <a href="https://cybre.space" rel="nofollow noopener">https://cybre.space</a> <a href="https://glitch.social" rel="nofollow noopener">https://glitch.social</a></p>
