    <title>2021-04-17 Social CG Meeting</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/2021-04-17-social-cg-meeting/1607</link>
    <description>I’m trying to show up more for these meetings. It’s hard for me to keep up to date on the daily, but once a week is literally the least I can do.

I think I did the right thing in trying to join [this telecom link](https://bbb.w3c.social/b/rhi-vp1-fv6-vn7), but haven’t managed to connect with anyone. Perhaps next time.

There are several places I looked for meeting links:
* https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG#Meetings &lt;— this seems relatively up to date
* https://denof.theoccasionoctopus.net/a/w3_social_web_incubator_community_group/event/details/f310a0d4-899b-4563-9356-12e0479cafc5

Brainstorms (can inform resolutions/actions):
* Add some link about ‘Meetings’ to https://www.w3.org/community/SocialCG/ -&gt; https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG#Meetings
  * Anyone that gets to the [socialcg  page](https://www.w3.org/community/SocialCG/) may try to join the mumble server, which is one of the newest (if not new) posts on the CG page
  * BLOCKER: (for me) HOWTO update the SocialCG page with latest meeting link. @rhiaro any ideas on how to do this, or who might know?

Resolutions:
* Resolving ‘what is the primary issue tracker that the SocialCG should treat as a job queue? https://github.com/swicg/general/issues/27</description>
