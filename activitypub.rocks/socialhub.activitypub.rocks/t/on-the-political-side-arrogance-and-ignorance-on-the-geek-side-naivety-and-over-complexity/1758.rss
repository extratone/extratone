    <description>This is a good read to highlight some social/tech issues we are talking about here https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2021/the-oss-bubble-and-the-blogging-bubble/

And why we need to talk about the #dotcons and how we can build useful things in the current #techmess.</description>

            <p>Well, you don’t hear me arguing for “technical solutions”. I mentioned “solutions” i.e. stuff that addressess social issues. How tech plays a role in supporting a solution is an implementation detail, and part of the elaboration.</p>

<p>Good activist have stopped pushing “technical solutions” and started to push “social solutions”.</p>
<p>Thinking If we change society the people can fix the problems themselves and this is the ONLY way good change actually happens.</p>

            <p>Yet, in that thread too, while there’s plenty problem analysis, there’s only little solution-focus coming into the picture. This makes these discussions TL;DR for many people, leaving them with a “been there, done that” hopeless feeling, without reading the bright spots and broadening these out.</p>
<p>(This is a general rant/gripe of mine, which I see everywhere, like also in Humane Tech Community: this is bad, that is evil… but what is the right way, and how do we get there? I miss that solution perspective very often. Btw, with climate activists this issue is also very prevalent).</p>

<p>The Great Transformation is a book by Karl Polanyi, a Hungarian-American political economist. First published in 1944 by Farrar &amp; Rinehart, it deals with the social and political upheavals that took place in England during the rise of the market economy. Polanyi contends that the modern market economy and the modern nation-state should be understood not as discrete elements but as the single human invention he calls the "Market Society".
 A distinguishing characteristic of the "Market Society" is...</p>

<p>The Invisible Hand is an economic concept that was first introduced by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, written in 1759. The Invisible Hand is a metaphor describing the unintended greater social benefits and public good brought about by individuals acting in their own self-interests though according to Smith it was literally Divine Providence, that is, the hand of God working to make this happen.
 By the time he wrote The Wealth of Nations in 1776, Smith had studied the economic mode...</p>

            <p>This is a brilliant article and a MUST READ. Thanks for posting, Hamish. Finding sustainable income from FOSS development is one of my driving forces. The concerns expressed in that article have been with me for a long time, and are among the reasons why I spend a ton of time volunteeering, advocating and doing community work, rather than deep-diving into code projects (which, really, I would rather do).</p>
<p>Here on the Fediverse, I feel, we have greater opportunities to build flourishing initiatives in that regard than we have at other places.</p>
