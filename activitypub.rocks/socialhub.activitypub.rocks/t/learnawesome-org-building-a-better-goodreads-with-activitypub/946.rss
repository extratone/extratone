I have been building [LearnAwesome.org](https://learnawesome.org/) as an ActivityPub compliant equivalent of GoodReads - generalized to learning, rather than reading. It’s both a repository of learning resources (books, but also blogs, courses, podcasts, newsletters, livestreams etc) and a social network. In this talk, I will talk about the system design, a demo and walk you through the steps I took to implement ActivityPub source and sink support in this Ruby on Rails based webapp.
