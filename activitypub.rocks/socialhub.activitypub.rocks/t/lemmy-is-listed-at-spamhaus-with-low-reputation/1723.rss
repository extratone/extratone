    <description>Hi @lemmy team,

Just came here to notify some findings. As https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/fediverse-futures-is-now-on-lemmy/1557 I am sharing links around to the community space. At LinkedIn I noticed that the URL is marked as Malicious and LI does not allow access, but redirects to this [LI genneral malware page](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/general-malware-page?url=https%3A%2F%2Flemmy%2eml%2Fc%2Ffediversefutures).

I tested with @bengo on LI a couple of other Lemmy URL&#39;s and found only fediverse futures URL to have this. So I contacted LI support:

Hi Arnold,

Thanks for reaching out to us. My name is Natalia from the LinkedIn Member Support Team and I will be happy to help you today.

LinkedIn does not block any external links and does not mark them as &quot;dangerous&quot;. Your external URL has been marked as unsafe/spam/malicious by &quot;Spamhaus&quot;, which you can check here: https://check.spamhaus.org/listed/?searchterm=lemmy.ml

In order to remove your address from &quot;Spamhaus&quot;, I recommend reading detailed information provided in the link above. This link also provides instructions on what steps to take to have your site recognized as safe. 

I hope you find the information I have given you useful! 

I am wishing you good luck and please contact me again if you have any questions about your account in the future!

Kind Regards,
 
Natalia

Now, @bengo told me that at his end &quot;All of those were marked as potentially harmful, and I had to click to show the full URL :/ Wonder if it‚Äôs based on the TLD?&quot;

There is indeed one entry for Lemmy: https://check.spamhaus.org/listed/?searchterm=lemmy.ml</description>
