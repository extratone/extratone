    <title>Detecting Language (i.e. English, Spanish, Russian, etc)</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/detecting-language-i-e-english-spanish-russian-etc/1349</link>
    <description>Does anyone have a good solution to the problem of servers that post content that don&#39;t contain the @language tag in the @context for &quot;Note&quot; Objects, for example. That would for example have &quot;en&quot; for English language. I&#39;m noticing that tons of messages in outboxes I&#39;m reading from across the web don&#39;t have language specified, so I get tons of foreign language stuff on my English language server.

I know I can use a spell checker to impose a rule of like if more than 60% of words are unknown think of it as non-English, but that would be quite a hack.</description>
