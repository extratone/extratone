    <title>Installation issue</title>

    <description>I&#39;m not familiar with Drupal, and I could not find anything clear about what `private://activitypub/cache` means in terms of UNIX. After fiddling around I figured it might be by default `$app_root/sites/default/files/activitypub/cache` but it does not seem to be the case. I tried using `$settings`, etc. but never found a good solution: I&#39;m stuck with the following errors:

![image|641x389](upload://icIhyo7HZcoW5smUZqsJNdIleUc.png) 

If only I knew what is the corresponding path on the filesystem I could check for permissions. All the permissions are OK for `www-data` user which is running the PHP process. 

Apart from this I have a running drupal 8 (9 would not install!) at https://drupal.demo.activitypub.eu that alledgedly support ActivityPub :innocent:</description>
