    <title>Public Spaces conference March 11 and 12, registration required</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/public-spaces-conference-march-11-and-12-registration-required/1483</link>
    <description>I heard about https://publicspaces.net/conference-2021/ which seems like it might be interesting to some in this community. It&#39;s free to attend, but you need to register. Starting [date=2021-03-11 time=17:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/Berlin&quot;].

&gt; We would like to start a conversation on how to bridge the gap between these public organisations and open source developers. Where to get funding? How to start co-creation with a public organisation? And how to create better designed, user-centric, value driven tools that are easy to implement by broadcasters, museums and festivals? A discussion with developers, investors, politicians and public organisations.</description>

            <p>Confirm. <a href="https://waag.org/en">Waag</a> is great. I also use their Jitsi instance (to alleviate load on main Jitsi servers) at <a href="https://meet.waag.org">meet.waag.org</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://publicspaces.net/timetable/event/mapping-the-ecosystem/">Mapping the ecosystem</a> track might be a good place to bring up the Interoperability plans of SocialHub, and how federation might support <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/standardizing-on-a-common-community-domain-as-ap-extension/1353">“community has no boundaries”</a> paradigm in support of this ecosystem.</p>

            <p>Organised by Waag it says on front page - they are pretty cool and helped set Fairphone up, so that’s a good track record.</p>

            <p>Yes, I got the exact same feeling, not even by trying to subscribe. I am missing an About Us providing some transparency who’s behind the initiative, and other than that the Contact Us form also doesn’t feel very ‘public space’ to me <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

            <h2>Unfortunately I cannot register since this is not a public space</h2>
<p>I tried to register to this conference, only to facepalm at the service provider “hopin”: their website does not work at all without JavaScript and each call to their pages <strong>require</strong> calls to at least a dozen different domains “just to work”, including many trackers. Coming back to Public Spaces <a href="https://publicspaces.net/manifesto/">manifesto</a>, where you can read, among other things:</p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Our guarantees</h2>
<p>In our view, founded in our values and principles, the internet should house truly public spaces, where specific guarantees can be extended to all those who enter these public spaces:</p>
<ol>
<li>User data are safe and can never be provided to third parties.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Etc.</p>
<p>Well, maybe the Public Spaces Conference could start with actually providing this setting to their own participants. Otherwise I cannot see how they will gather people working on digital public spaces besides those who do not have a clue about what they’re talking about, or do compromise enough not to find it problematic to send user data to GMAFIA in the process of registering to the conference.</p>
<p>Once again, this situation repeats where people prefer to ignore the technical issues underlying their positions rather than embrace them and make a stand. I am so sad that it happens yet again, despite the appetizing round table participants. I cannot see anything good coming from there where a (digital) public space is not provided to discuss and debate about (digital) public spaces. This kind of oversight generates thought bubbles way too present within academic circles where only a small piece of the puzzle is taken as the whole.</p>
