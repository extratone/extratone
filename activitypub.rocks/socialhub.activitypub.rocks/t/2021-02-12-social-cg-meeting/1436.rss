    <title>2021-02-12 Social CG Meeting</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/2021-02-12-social-cg-meeting/1436</link>
    <description>Hi all,

Unfortunately this week once again we have no chairs available for the SocialCG meeting. However, the [BBB](https://bbb.w3c.social) is available for anyone to use who would like to chat with others at the usual Friday time. Perhaps reply in this thread with topics you would like to discuss, so that others know who might be around.

Date: [date=2021-02-12 time=17:00:00 timezone=&quot;Europe/London&quot;] 

If some people do meet and you decide you would like to take notes in IRC that get persisted to the W3C servers, you can see [how to do that on the SocialCG wiki](https://www.w3.org/wiki/SocialCG#Meetings). Ping me in IRC if you&#39;re stuck and I&#39;ll help if I&#39;m online.</description>

    Following the recent <a href="https://redaktor.me/apconf/" rel="nofollow noopener">APConf in Prague</a>, I tried going through the resources at hand for new ActivityPub implementers, <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/discussing-onboarding-for-developers/61">reviewing what we could improve to ease the onboarding</a>. activitypub.rocks plays a major role in this, being the main landing page for the protocol. 
In the meantime, this forum has been created and made public. It could play a major role at organizing the information long-term for varied audiences, but would not replace ap.rocks as a landing page, which means we have to properly l…

    Setting up the dev environment
Cloning from git
First clone and change directory to a checkout of <a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/activitypub.rocks" rel="nofollow noopener">the git repository</a>: 
git clone https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/activitypub.rocks.git
cd activitypub.rocks

Setting up dependencies the easy way: use Guix
Next you’re going to get the environment up and running.  The “easy” way to do this is to use <a href="https://guix.gnu.org/" rel="nofollow noopener">Guix</a> (which can be run as its own operating system distribution or as a userspace package manager under any GNU/Linux distribution): 
guix environment -l guix…

            <p>Some suggestions (but I don’t know if I am able to join yet):</p>
<h3>SocialCG / SocialHub repository management</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The AS / AP repo’s are full of longstanding open issues. Should we breathe life in repo maintenance again? How?</p>
<ul>
<li>Closing issues leads to updates in spec. How are these handled? Is there a vNext planned?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>We have tons of actionable ideas, some small some large, dwelling in this forum. Should we issue track them in a new repo?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a class="hashtag" href="/c/fediversity/fediverse-futures/58">#<span>fediversity:fediverse-futures</span></a> topics contain many ideas. I’d like to track them in a repo issue tracker. Allowed?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is the Discourse Github plugin active, so issues + topics are auto-linked? (<a class="mention" href="/u/how">@how</a>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>SocialHub website maintenance</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I guess burden to maintain SocialHub website lies mostly with <a class="mention" href="/u/cwebber">@cwebber</a>. How can we share the burden?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shouldn’t we significantly update the website, maybe completely revamp it first?</p>
</li>
</ul>
