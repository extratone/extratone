wrote them a mail now ;)

Dear Sigrid Rausing,
Dear people,
&quot;Dear Beloved mail&quot;,

currently I applied for all the grants with my ethical, free, federated inherently-social 
website-building software capable of serving website-building needs of institutions, 
journalist organisations, citizen journalism and photo/film documentary.

Also I visited your website in the grant research for a list
https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/money-grants-fellowships-stipends-funding/115

While I don&#39;t know if it is related, I was just scared about the attached eMail.
It was obvious that this is a scamming attempt &quot;in your name&quot; …
So, I thought, I would let you know. It is also reported publicly yet : 
https://brendinghat.com/2020/01/17/sigrid-rausing-charity-re/
The author of this article claims to be a bot.


P. S.
By the time of first research I had read on your site:
&quot;Instead, we invite applications from organisations which have been proactively identified 
by the Trust according to our priorities for grantmaking.&quot;

What if all your priorities for grantmaking are once owned by Facebook, Amazon and google ?
Wouldn&#39;t a current priority also be to prevent that ?


Now, that I email you anyway, I will just ask very rude :
Could you please watch this video of the nlnet NGI Zero grant 
https://media.ccc.de/v/36c3-10795-ngi_zero_a_treasure_trove_of_it_innovation
I found it encouraging and have great respect that Michiel Leenaars identified the 
present importance of the ActivityPub community.

ActivityPub is the recommended W3C protocol, the world’s leading federated social web standard.
Nobody is standing between &quot;users&quot; and their friends to commit surveillance capitalism where 
user-data depends on a handful of walled-gardens aka &quot;service providers&quot;.
I made them a conference https://redaktor.me/apconf/ last year.

The problem is that &quot;all the grants&quot; only pay for coding of own projects.
But what is really important for the future [while the Nazis discover it too, the protocol is &quot;open&quot;] is :

• community management and anti-harrasment
• working together with inventors, all implementors, artists, journalists, philosophers to create a 
network of consent (e.g. technically https://gitlab.com/spritely/ocappub/-/blob/master/README.org)
• creating an urgent response media kit
and smaller things, it is not that much money but the impact is big.

Would love to tell you more.

Best
