    <title>EU Consumers confirm need for effective interoperability in DMA</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/eu-consumers-confirm-need-for-effective-interoperability-in-dma/1682</link>
    <description>In latest [Interoperability News toot](https://activism.openworlds.info/@InteropNews/106153145767687515) there was mention of this article: https://interoperability.news/2021/04/european-consumers-confirm-need-for-effective-interoperability-in-digital-markets-act/

It refers to some interesting work by the European Consumer Organization [BEUC](https://www.beuc.eu/):

- A [Position Paper on the Digital Markets Act Proposal](https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2021-030_digital_markets_act_proposal.pdf) (PDF)
- A [Factsheet on the Digital Markets Act](https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2021-031_proposal_for_an_eu_digital_markets_act.pdf) (PDF)
- An [Assessment of the Digital Markets Act](https://www.beuc.eu/publications/beuc-x-2021-035_overview_of_beucs_assessment_of_proposed_digital_markets_act.pdf) (PDF)

The factsheet mentions what the proposed Digital Markets Act would do for consumers, quoting..

&gt; The DMA would prohibit gatekeepers from using a number of unfair practices that harm consumers, such as:
&gt; 
&gt; - **blocking  users  from  un-installing**  pre-installed  software or apps
&gt;
&gt; - **mixing  user’s  personal  data**  collected  on  one  of  their  core  platform  services  with  personal  data  collected  on  another  of  their  services  or  personal  data from third parties
&gt; - **prohibiting  services  using  a  gatekeeper’s  app  store   from   selling   discounted   subscriptions** bought  directly  from  the  service  provider’s  own  website rather than the app store
&gt; - **discriminating   against   other   providers’   apps** on  their  app  stores  or  prohibiting  competing  app  stores on devices
&gt; - **forcing  customers  to  sign  up  for  other  core  platform  services**  in  order  to  access  the  specific  service they wanted to use (e.g. consumers wishing to  use  Instagram  could  not  be  obliged  to  have  a  Facebook account)
&gt; - **gathering  data  on  their  business  customers  to  ascertain  how  best  to  compete  with  them**  and  whether  to  themselves  market  their  customers’  most successful products
&gt; - **ranking  their  own  products  or  services  more  favourably than third party services** e.g. in search results• locking in customers by“technically restricting” users from switching away from default apps and services

And to top it off they wrote a nice blog post about all this:
