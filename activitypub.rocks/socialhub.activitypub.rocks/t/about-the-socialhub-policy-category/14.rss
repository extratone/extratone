    <title>About the SocialHub Policy category</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/about-the-socialhub-policy-category/14</link>
    <description>Members of the ActivityPub SocialHub community practice collective governance and co-construct shared policies to reflect common norms.

Each topic matches a given policy that is proposed, debated and eventually adopted or rejected.

Only @staff can start a policy topic. If you&#39;re interested in proposing one, please open a new topic under #community.

## Using the Policy Feature

The policy feature is available to @staff members and can be set with a special markup:

```plain
[policy group=staff reminder=daily]
We strive to be excellent to each other.
[/policy]
```

In the example above, the policy applies to members of the @staff group, who are reminded every day -- nagged -- to adopt it. In order to propose a policy for everyone, the `trust_level_0` group can be used.

For more detailed information about this feature, you can see the [discourse-policy topic on Meta](https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-policy/88557).

And for good measure...

[policy group=staff reminder=daily]
We strive to be excellent to each other.
