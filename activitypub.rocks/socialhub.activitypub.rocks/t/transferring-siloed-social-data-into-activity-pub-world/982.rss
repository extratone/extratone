    <title>Transferring siloed social data into activity pub world:</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/transferring-siloed-social-data-into-activity-pub-world/982</link>
    <description>I’m interested in accessing my own social datasets through the activity pub protocol, with a simple user-interface based on it becoming my primary interface to the social networks.
I’ve begun an open-source project with a React front-end and a Scala back-end to enable this. beginning with twitter data obtained through archive export, api access, and the real-time account activity stream capability.
Please join this BoF if you’d like to see a quick demo, are interested in the idea of an activitypub ‘bridge’, or have ideas about an activitypub UI for managing your extended network and inbox/outbox.
