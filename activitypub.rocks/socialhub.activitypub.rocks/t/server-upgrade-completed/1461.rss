    <description>The original server is a tiny VM, and I need to double it up so it can take the next Discourse upgrade.

The monthly cost will go from 3.01 to 5.93 EURO per month. But we&#39;ll have double RAM and double disk space, enough to see coming for the next round of updates this year and hopefully the next one.

I will proceed to the upgrade tonight so it does not disrupt our usage. It should be a short downtime. I will make a banner announcement so people know what to expect.

20:50 UTC -- The banner is in place, announcing downtime at 22:00 UTC.
22:27 UTC -- The service will be read-only during backup...
22:36 UTC -- Rescaling the service from 2 to 4GB RAM, from 20 to 40GB SSD.
22:48 UTC -- Service restored and upgraded.</description>

            <p>No the RAM was fine, it was the disk space that was short. I had the choice between adding a volume or making the machine bigger. I preferred the second option since it gives more power as well for a similar cost. 2GB of RAM is plenty. Here’s the current usage:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">socialhub:~$ free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           3850        1528         287         282        2033        1803
Swap:          2047           2        2045
</code></pre>
<p>In comparison, another Discourse running with 2GB RAM:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-auto">@nsl:~# free -m
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           1947        1360          67         115         518         290
Swap:          2047         147        1900
</code></pre>

            <p>Oh wow, couldn’t you upgrade Discourse with the 2GB mem VPS? I am happy I’ve chosen 4GB from the start for my own installation, but I hope to run some more services from this VPS besides Discourse.</p>
