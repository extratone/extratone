    <description>If you search for &quot;events&quot; on this forum, you come across a number of discussion threads, spread across a bunch of the different boards:

Would it help to have a board specifically for this area of work? This might help devs working on free code projects that have events-related features, to break the problem of federated events  into smaller, more manageable chunks.</description>

            <p>Perhaps the category could cover both events and groups, incorporating discussions like this?<br>

    I’ve implemented groups in <a href="https://gitlab.com/ngerakines/tavern" rel="nofollow noopener">Tavern</a> and would like feedback and comments. All of the group specific actor and activity behavior is documented in <a href="https://gitlab.com/ngerakines/tavern/-/blob/issue-21-groups/FEDERATION.md" rel="nofollow noopener">https://gitlab.com/ngerakines/tavern/-/blob/issue-21-groups/FEDERATION.md</a> as well. 
Groups share the same namespace as users and it is up to instance operators to moderate how that namespace is managed. For example, both @sneakerheads@groups.tavern.town, @sneakerheads-group@tavern.town, and @sneakerheads@tavern.town are all valid names. I’m considering ad…

            <p>Might make it easier for people like me who try and follow discussions - and I do specifically want to follow and commit to event related federation. My focus on activitypub is very sporadic (based on available time/headspace in relation to paid work on other topics) so something to follow, collate, read, could help.</p>

</aside>
<p>Yes. What I’m seeing is that it’s too big a field of activity, with too many interested parties, to be sorted out in a single discussion thread. It seems like it needs a dedicated space in which to separate out the discussion into multiple threads. That’s what I mean by a “board” (from pre-web “bulletin board”), which I think is what you mean by “category”.</p>
<p>What do others think?</p>

            <p>I’m not sure what you mean by “board” in this context. Several discussions were started in various contexts (e.g., <a class="hashtag" href="/c/software/mobilizon/20">#<span>software:mobilizon</span></a> or <a class="hashtag" href="/c/software/14">#<span>software</span></a>), but the main discussion for developers of <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/federated-events/305" class="inline-onebox">Federated Events</a> happens in that topic of <a class="hashtag" href="/c/activitypub/5">#<span>activitypub</span></a>. It really depends on the context: interop, a specific implementation, etc.</p>
