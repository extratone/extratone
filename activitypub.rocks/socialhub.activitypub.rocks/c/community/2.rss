<p>Now this website is not a ‘foundation’ in the sense of a non-profit. It is meant to provide a foundation to both the SocialHub community and the Fediverse technology base. To read more about it, you can visit the following pages:</p>

          <title>Proposal: New top-level forum section for Domains</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[aschrijver]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Community</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>With a host of <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/hospitality-exchange-community-considers-moving-to-the-fediverse/1765">Hospitality platforms</a> now considering federation, and already a bunch of different application categories being covered by various apps (Microblogging, of course, Blogging, Media platforms, etc.) I would like to propose adding a new top-level forum section “Domains” for this. A subcategory would then be “Domains/Hospitality”.</p>
<p>Though <a class="hashtag" href="/c/fediversity/fediverse-futures/58">#<span>fediversity:fediverse-futures</span></a> can be used for general-purpose discussion, these domain subcategories are meant to deep-dive into e.g. specific vocabulary extensions, messaging patterns and all kinds of other interop issues that are specific to apps within that domain.</p>

            <h2>
<a name="motivation-1" class="anchor" href="#motivation-1"></a>Motivation:</h2>
<p>information note towards a more complete followup to <a href="https://github.com/swicg/general/issues/27" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">this resolution swicg/27</a></p>
<h2>
<a name="status-of-this-document-2" class="anchor" href="#status-of-this-document-2"></a>Status of this Document</h2>
<p>Drafted based on ACTION from 2021-04-23 SocialCG call.</p>
<p>Comments requested to help ensure this links to all the relevant issue trackers this community considers important.</p>
<h1>
<a name="social-cg-issue-trackers-3" class="anchor" href="#social-cg-issue-trackers-3"></a>Social CG Issue Trackers</h1>
<p>This is a mapping of SocialCG Topic Area to an issue tracker where community members can file issues.</p>
<ul>
<li>ActivityPub: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/issues" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Issues · w3c/activitypub · GitHub</a>
</li>
<li>ActivityStreams2: <a href="https://github.com/w3c/activitystreams/issues" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Issues · w3c/activitystreams · GitHub</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is no subproject-specific issue tracker, use:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/swicg/general/issues" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">swicg/general on GitHub</a></li>
</ul>
<h1>
<a name="on-multiple-issue-trackers-and-consensus-4" class="anchor" href="#on-multiple-issue-trackers-and-consensus-4"></a>On Multiple Issue Trackers and Consensus</h1>
<p>If there is one issue tracker, there is an numbered ordering that would let the group process issues one-by-one. With multiple issue trackers, there is no obvious ordering on how to process issues from each issue tracker ‘queue’ (e.g. round-robin, chronological, etc.).</p>
<p>Issues can be filed without consensus of the group. They can also be discussed ad infinitum based on individual decisions. If the group were to attempt to work on all issues, the group would be subject to denial of service attacks. Thus, it may be best for the group and calls to only spend much time on issues that the group adopts by consensus. See <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/c-t-butler-and-amy-rothstein-on-conflict-and-consensus-a-handbook-on-formal-consensus-decisionm" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“On Conflict and Consensus”</a> for one definition of Formal Consensus.</p>
<h2>
<a name="recommendation-5" class="anchor" href="#recommendation-5"></a>Recommendation</h2>
<p>If possible, resolve issues outside the meetings. If you file an issue, set a reminder to check on it weekly to see if you can close it or consider it resolved without action in a meeting. If you’d like to raise attention in a meeting (2 minutes), request a small amount of time in a meeting to present the issue verbally, and request comments async.</p>
<p>If an issue has been open for awhile, and you think a group discussion could unblock it (not always the case), propose a <em>Work Item</em> in the group, which we can try to adopt via consensus. Reasonable objection to this would be:</p>
<ul>
<li>already having other work items in progress. <a href="https://kanbanize.com/kanban-resources/getting-started/what-is-wip" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Limiting work in progress in one way of maximizing throughput</a>
</li>
<li>the Work Item does not have a clear definition of done to know when it will be complete.
<ul>
<li>See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_charter" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">“Project Charter”</a> for inspiration on how to charter a work item such that its cost and benefits can be understood to prioritize against other Work Items.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Work Items related to protocols MAY result in a deliverable of a Fediverse Enhancement Proposal:</p>

          <title>The SocialHub on Conf.Tube</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[how]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Community</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>From the beginning, we adopted <a href="http://conf.tube">http://conf.tube</a> to disseminate videos related to the ActivityPub community. The <a href="https://conf.tube/accounts/apconf/video-channels">APconf account</a> was created for the <a class="hashtag" href="/c/meeting/apconf2020/53">#<span>meeting:apconf2020</span></a> and remains there to give witness to the work accomplished.</p>
<p>Yesterday I obtained from <a href="https://floss.social/@rgggn">@rgggn</a>, the admin of conf.tube a dedicated <a href="https://conf.tube/accounts/socialhub">socialhub</a> account for the ActivityPub community at large. I would like here to propose how we could use this account collectively, notably to avoid further hiccups with timely access to the <em>publish</em> button.</p>
<p>Here are a few topics we can discuss here…</p>
<h2>
<a name="what-is-the-socialhub-account-for-1" class="anchor" href="#what-is-the-socialhub-account-for-1"></a>What is the socialhub account for?</h2>
<p><em>This section is to define what goes to the video channels</em></p>
<p>Description: <a href="https://conf.tube/accounts/socialhub/about" class="inline-onebox">The ActivityPub Community - ConfTube</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/">SocialHub</a> brings together members of the W3 Social CG, ActivityPub implementors, users, researchers, and other interested people to further the development of the specifications and explore the Fediverse together.</p>
<p>This account provides channels to share ongoing work with the community. For the ActivityPub Conference, see the <a href="https://conf.tube/apconf">APConf</a> account.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
<a name="access-to-the-socialhub-account-on-conftube-2" class="anchor" href="#access-to-the-socialhub-account-on-conftube-2"></a>Access to the socialhub account on conf.tube</h2>
<p><em>How to hit this publish button</em></p>
<p>As for other SocialHub assets, the <a class="mention-group" href="/groups/sysadmin.team">@sysadmin.team</a> shares credentials to access the account.</p>
<ul>
<li>should we define another team to share credentials with?</li>
<li>should we define some dedicated channels?<br>
2 initial channels come to mind:
<ul>
<li>ActivityPub for Administrations (our current webinars/workshop series)</li>
<li>APconf 2021 if we want to do that</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>should we define a following policy?</li>
</ul>
<p>For all questions my guts feeling is that we should trust our community members and respond to requests here. When questions arise, we can discuss the specific cases.</p>

          <title>SocialHub and Spiral Island: A Fediverse Foundation Analogy</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[aschrijver]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Community</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Spiral Island was created by Richart Sowa from stuff other people considered trash. An inspiring symbol of sustainability and hope, it was nonetheless destroyed by a hurricane. Richart’s work in a way mirrors how we build our beloved Fediverse… but we must prepare to be hurricane-proof…</p>

<p>The people that are passionately advocating and building the Fediverse…</p>
<p>They are a friendly bunch from all around the world having very diverse backgrounds and leading interesting, colourful lives. Online they are together as one, united in humanity, these fedizens. The Fediverse they build are like small and fragile islands anchored precariously in the waves of society. Flourishing island communities, together they form an archipelago, where a unique culture thrives. It is worth protecting. It is unique. It is promising too, and deserves to grow.</p>
<p>Exposed to rough seas of inhumane technology and raging tides of Big Tech, the fedizens take great care to maintain and expand. Building things the way they like it best. There is freedom. A speck of beauty among dark waters and threatening clouds. There’s an economy on the islands. People exchanging thoughts and ideas, they inspire and encourage each other to make things better. Ever improving.</p>
<p>Like Spiral Island everything rests upon its floating foundation, the Fediverse technology base. It is mashed together by bits and pieces of knowledge re-applied - discarded bottles, that others made to trash, reused here… revived as Humane Technology. The island fedizens, techies and others, work tirelessly to make things more buoyant and expand the space. This group of builders, of friends, is called the SocialHub. A great team that everyone can join to help and build.</p>
<p><a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/organizing-for-socialhub-community-empowerment/1529">Foundations are important</a>, they are vital. They are the ground upon which we stand. Not all bottles stick well together all so easily. They need to be bound and tied together. If done well, then marvelous structures - our federated apps - can stand upon them and never fall apart. There’ll be bridges between them, and hanging gardens. Places of wonder to behold.</p>
<p>Builders are important too, and those that support them in whatever ways. They allow the Fediverse archipelago to evolve ever further, and maintain what already floats. Collaboration is key, and - while freedom reigns - some coordination is required here. So that balance is maintained.</p>
<p>It is easy to find supporters, because the story of these great small islands is so inspiring. Turning trash into beauty. Do things the way they are meant to be done. Humanely, passionately and with vibrant life. A compelling story, this Tale of the  Fediverse. It will naturally spread.</p>
<p>Just being on these islands, to participate and walk its winding paths, means one educates oneself on how things ought to be. No need to preach, or even to convince and force ideas on others.</p>
<p>Come join us! Just follow the signs, our rallying cry. They read clearly and loud: <em>“Social Media Reimagined”</em><br>
Let’s imagine it together.</p>
<hr>
<p>Enough prose for now. There’s more to this anology, and not all is well, but that’s for later. What is important is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>This Foundation exists already, but we don’t realize enough its importance to keep us afloat and weather storms together!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we have now is still too loose. It is hard to extend and build upon. And there’s good chance it won’t survive a hurricane.</p>

          <title>Rationale for participation in SocialHub</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[aschrijver]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Community</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>This is a reaction to <a class="hashtag" href="/c/software/forgefed/60">#<span>software:forgefed</span></a> intention to move from Feneas to SocialHub and <a href="https://talk.feneas.org/u/bill-auger">@bill-auger</a>’s observation in <a href="https://talk.feneas.org/t/moving-to-socialhub/389/10?u=aschrijver">Moving to SocialHub</a> arguing that ForgeFed might as well be stand-alone, rather than “be with family” on SocialHub. This because of its differrent nature to most other federated social apps. I started typing on Feneas, then moved here because there are important points I want to make re:Community, namely that:</p>
<p><strong>We at Fediverse and ActivityPub ecosystem should not overestimate ourselves: We are still but weak!</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>I am a big AP / Fediverse advocate, taking much spare time to promote it, because I strongly believe in its all-FOSS, humanetech, and “social media reimagined” potential. I have name-dropped ForgeFed + URL’s at least 100+ times, including on occasion to people with “Sigh, it’s dead” reactions, explaining this is not the case.</p>
<details><summary>My collapsed argument that AP/Fedi evolution too slow, making us weak and needing focal points of coordination (click to expand).</summary>
<p>On AP / Fedi itself I notice that - while its install base is healthy-ish - its dev community overall is very small and thus quite weak-ish in upholding innovation pace. And the fragmentation by which development takes place is hampering fedi + standards evolution, imho.</p>
<p>Though we are proponents of decentralized technology our community needs central focal points to coordinate, where “the family” comes together, so to say. In this we only really have SocialCG and SocialHub (plus <span class="hashtag">#social</span> irc channel, and some matrix rooms, but they are less effective for knowledge gathering and coordination). A metric ton of useful developer information goes lost each day, because it happens on isolated islands and others aren’t aware. The onboarding experience for new devs that want their apps to federate and make sense of the technology is horrible.</p>
<p>And as a result AP / Fediverse innovation &amp; evolution speed is lagging imho, when compared to other decentralized technologies. Even though we have truly production-ready platforms, tested to reality, slowly other tech may become the more attractive candidates. Solid project, though doing zero community-building and having no apps in production is 3x as large as SocialHub, and SAFE community is 16x as large, IPFS 10x exceeds our little group.</p>
<p>There was excitement and trepidation about Jack Dorsey’s Bluesky report. But the questions are a) if they’d choose AP could we handle it and b) if they’d choose another tech could we handle it? We should not become irrelevant, folks. We want to lobby the EU to become a recognized interop standard, but we currently simply have no good story.  Finally I wan to once more point to <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/are-we-ready-for-the-threats-to-the-fediverse-and-decentralization-movement/810" class="inline-onebox">Are we ready for the threats to the Fediverse and decentralization movement?</a> My conclusion:</p>
</details>
<p><img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/loudspeaker.png?v=9" title=":loudspeaker:" class="emoji" alt=":loudspeaker:"> &nbsp; <strong>We urgently need a stronger SocialHub to reinforce the ActivityPub ecosystem !</strong></p>
<p>Now as for ForgeFed, an AP extension: This community is all about ActivityPub, the standard specifications itself and their extensions. Even though at times it may appear to be more about Fediverse and Social Apps. With that focus we are losing the Linked Data aspects of AP out of sight sometimes, and I’ve argued to <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/positioning-activitypub-de-emphasize-being-part-of-the-fediverse-as-primary-usp/1197" class="inline-onebox">Positioning ActivityPub: De-Emphasize "Being Part of the Fediverse" as primary USP</a>.</p>
<p>ForgeFed is an exemplar of this broader perspective on the use of AP, and a most welcome addition in the range of AP apps already present here. Also, while ForgeFed is otherwise catering to code forge projects, there are also other AP projects with relations to ForgeFed, like <a class="hashtag" href="/c/software/go-fed/18">#<span>software:go-fed</span></a> that does code generation from ForgeFed vocabulary and is eyed by Gitea for implementing. Similarly if code forges start to investigate ForgeFed, where better to do that than on an active forum that is chock-full of AP info and helpful hands?</p>
<p>So I for one truly hope ForgeFed will come/stay here. You are great, you are needed, and represent the new way of federating apps, even beyond social realms.</p>

            <p>The original server is a tiny VM, and I need to double it up so it can take the next Discourse upgrade.</p>
<p>The monthly cost will go from 3.01 to 5.93 EURO per month. But we’ll have double RAM and double disk space, enough to see coming for the next round of updates this year and hopefully the next one.</p>
<p>I will proceed to the upgrade tonight so it does not disrupt our usage. It should be a short downtime. I will make a banner announcement so people know what to expect.</p>
<p>20:50 UTC – The banner is in place, announcing downtime at 22:00 UTC.<br>
22:27 UTC – The service will be read-only during backup…<br>
22:36 UTC – Rescaling the service from 2 to 4GB RAM, from 20 to 40GB SSD.<br>
22:48 UTC – Service restored and upgraded.</p>

<h3>Proposal stage</h3>
<p>Since this is a <a class="mention-group" href="/groups/staff">@staff</a> proposal, the policy <s>will</s> enter<ins>ed</ins> into force <del>after a week</del> <ins>on</ins> (<span data-date="2021-02-19" class="discourse-local-date" data-timezone="Europe/Brussels" data-email-preview="2021-02-18T23:00:00Z UTC">2021-02-18T23:00:00Z</span>), to leave a bit of time for debate, in the hope to clarify any ambiguous point that may appear.

            <h2>Be CareFOO!</h2>
<p>Happy to introduce the “Care FOO” policy! Please take the time to read it thoroughly.</p>
<hr>
<div class="policy" data-group="trust_level_1" data-version="1" data-reminder="weekly" data-accept="I agree to abide by these values" data-revoke="I disagree and will go elsewhere">
<h1>We Care For Our Own</h1>
<p>Members of the Social Web Incubator CG agree to abide by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>On top of this, we acknowledge that Web and communication technologies are inherently political and can be used to cause harm, against the intent of the original creators. We recognise power imbalances already endemic in the tech industry, and in Social Web systems in mainstream use. With that in mind, we do not welcome participation (however polite) by contributors to projects which are designed or primarily used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>oppression, or encouraging oppression, of vulnerable people or minority groups.</li>
<li>planning, encouragement of or inciting violence against vulnerable people.</li>
<li>promoting fascism, nazism or other authoritarian systems and practices.</li>
<li>perpetuating, promoting, or enacting systematic injustices, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are vigilant for the use of imagery, language and dogwhistles related to such behaviours. We reserve the right to exclude projects which tolerate such behaviours within their communities, or have not made a good faith effort to discourage such behaviours.</p>
<p>The intent of this policy is <em>not</em> to exclude wholesale any developers involved with projects or communities who unknowingly interact with bad actors, or who are struggling to or unable to eliminate behavior that goes against this policy in their wider communities. Similarly, we do not expect developers of open source projects to be responsible for every installation or fork of their codebase and will of course take the realities of this into account when making any moderation decisions.</p>
<p>SocialCG chairs and forum administrators may use their discretion to remove posts or suspend user accounts. SocialCG chairs may similarly refuse access to or remove individuals from virtual meetings.</p>
</div>
<h3>Active stage</h3>
<p>The policy is now active, from <span data-date="2021-02-19" class="discourse-local-date" data-timezone="Europe/Brussels" data-email-preview="2021-02-18T23:00:00Z UTC">2021-02-18T23:00:00Z</span>.</p>

Policy Details</summary>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>It does concern you!</h3>
<p>Following <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/policy-proposal-socialhub-community-values/1453">intense discussion during the proposal phase</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/rhiaro">@rhiaro</a> updated the Policy to make it clear we are not trying to place unreasonable burdens on developers or other participants in open source communities who can’t be held responsible for actions of wider communities or other users of their projects.</p>
<p>The policy above is destined to anyone willing to become a member of the SocialHub community, and applied here to <a class="mention-group" href="/groups/trust_level_1">@trust_level_1</a> – a group you’re automatically part of when you spend a few minutes reading around…</p>
<h3>Here’s how it plays…</h3>
<p>Once you’re in this group, you will receive a <em>weekly</em> reminder until you accept or refuse the policy.</p>
<p>You can simply click the “I agree to abide by these rules” button to accept the policy. If you want to refuse the policy, you first have to click the same button, and then the “I disagree and will go elsewhere” button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts with no policy agreement or with disagreement will be suspended indefinitely.</li>
<li>Accounts who do not abide by these rules will be removed as well.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<h3>Proposal stage</h3>
<p>The proposal stage got some intense discussion which is now archived at <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/policy-proposal-socialhub-community-values/1453">https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/policy-proposal-socialhub-community-values/1453</a>.</p>

            <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>Had a couple of complaints about the google reCAPTCHA barrier to <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/SocialCG/">joining the W3C Social Web CG</a>. The great news is the W3C systems team are receptive to our feedback, and may be able to put something on their roadmap about removing CAPTCHAs altogether.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, they have asked for advice about robust alternatives specifically to the google reCAPTCHA they could consider. They said “We’re aware of hCaptcha but at least when our team evaluated it a few months ago, it didn’t seem to have the level of usability/accessibility we needed.”</p>
<p>Does anyone have any suggestions I can pass on?</p>

            <p>Related: I have been thinking about a welcome or etiquette bot, that instance admins could suggest, or have auto-followed by new users.</p>
<p>It could take many forms, but some of the basics would relate to welcoming and informing about fedi-etiquette.</p>
<ul>
<li>Suggest to new users to make an intro post and pin it to profile</li>
<li>How the timelines, and privacy settings work</li>
<li>Explain how hashtags work</li>
<li>Remind users to use alt text if they have posted images without</li>
<li>Resources to getting started, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Obviously a bot like this would’t replace the welcome a community instance might offer, but it might be useful for on-boarding, and establishing a common culture across instances.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Given the many open discussions with unresolved stuff in it, would it be beneficial to add:</p>
<ol>
<li>An <code>open-issues</code> tage for the topics that have them.</li>
<li>A ‘mark as solution’ checkbox to highlight said solutions (requires plugin, I believe)</li>
</ol>
<p>What are some other ways in which we can make the forum more efficient?</p>
<ul>
<li>On mobile the pinned topics show part of the topic text, not just title, which takes too much space.</li>
<li>On mobile too the plugin to default to <code>/latest</code> is disabled (due to APConf troubleshooting of DB corruption)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>
<p>There’s also a Discourse menu plugin that gives you a full-blown dropdown menu on top of the forum. We can use this to provide an easy overview and quick drillfown to all the various fragmented sites and places where the community does her work. Like e.g. right now if I want to go to the FEP repo, I type in the FF address bar and let its history guide me. Others will  just not be aware of it unless they bump into + read the proper FEP thread.</p>

<p>If I’m adding fields to an ActivityPub object, and I expect them to be used widely in the future, which namespace should I be using? My own, i.e. <code>http://smithereen.software/ns#</code> ? ActivityStreams? Something else?</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Excellent question.</p>
<p>FEPs do not have any control of what should be added to ActivityStreams. Maybe it might make sense to add a FEP namespace (e.g. <code>https://activitypub.dev/fep/ns#</code> ) where things can be added but in the mean time I think it is better to use your own.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>I am sorry in advance if this shows technical ignorance (to my regret and own fault I don’t manage to get rid of non-technical stuff in favor of ‘deep work’ and coding).</p>
<p>In <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/fediverse-futures-visions-dreams-feedback-wanted/1238" class="inline-onebox">Fediverse Futures: Visions &amp; dreams. Feedback wanted</a> I make a case in elaborating business cases for specific application domains, aligning with the idea of defining specific and standardized Linked Data vocabularies for that (think ForgeFed) and implementations able to handle them (think go-fed, openEngiadina, BonFire, etc.)</p>
<p>(PS I also suggested Domain Driven Design as an excellent way to elaborate these vocabularies)</p>
<p>In terms of the namespace to use for them, a <code>https://activitypub.dev/fep/ns#</code> wouldn’t cut it then. The namespace should specifically address the application / business domain that the vocabulary extension targets, e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>https://activitypub.dev/fep/e7b9/campaigns/ns#</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or (different scheme):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>https://activitypub.dev/fep/communities/1.0/ns#</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or something else entirely, as <a class="mention" href="/u/pukkamustard">@pukkamustard</a> suggests we elaborate.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>W3C has started monitoring levels of activity in Community Groups (all groups actually) by watching mailing list and github traffic. Since the SocialCG doesn’t use a mailing list, and has work spread out in places other than <a href="https://github.com/swicg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://github.com/swicg</a> the monitoring tools basically make the group look abandoned (thanks <a class="mention" href="/u/sebastian">@Sebastian</a> for noticing this).</p>
<p>I’ve reached out to the W3C systems team, who do want to support the CG’s work mode better (and in the meantime have disabled the misleading activity chart on the CG homepage).</p>
<p>One thing that other CGs I’ve been involved with have is a process for including work items under the remit of the CG. This often involves moving or creating a repo under the CG’s gh organisation, but I’d understand if folks working on adjacent projects didn’t want to move their repos (or even use github).</p>
<p>Anyway, first I want to ask if we were to create a list of projects that we could consider under the remit of the CG, what to include? Any thoughts on criteria? An advantage for projects to be “CG projects” might include wider exposure, and time to discuss issues at CG meetings, but I’m not sure how attractive that is.</p>
<p>And if anyone else has any thoughts about this generally? Perhaps this extremely loose organisation is working for everone, and we shouldn’t try to introduce more process. But if we look like an active CG from the W3C’s perspective, we may get more visibility (and thus more participation) from people approaching via W3C.</p>

          <title>Anyone working on Event Discovery? (+ Intro to my project)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[jarofgreen]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Community</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I know there are several projects for events: <a href="https://framagit.org/framasoft/mobilizon" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Mobilizon</a>, <a href="https://github.com/GetTogetherComm/GetTogether/issues/60" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GetTogether</a>, <a href="https://github.com/lowercasename/gathio" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gathio</a>, <a href="https://framagit.org/les/gancio" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Gancio</a>, <a href="https://fairmove.it/fairsync/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Fairmove</a> …</p>
<p>Many of these projects are for people organising events, with features like attendee signup.</p>
<p><strong>Is anyone working on projects for discovering events that other people organise and then directing people back to the original home of the event online?</strong></p>
<p>(I know that may seem like a subtle distinction, but I think that brings up some important points on how the app works - and I back this up with 7 years running a popular events listing site with user feedback on this.)</p>
<p>I am, and even thought it’s very early days for my project I wanted to introduce it: <a href="https://www.theoccasionoctopus.net/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://www.theoccasionoctopus.net/</a></p>
<p>This is an event discovery app where everyone can have their own account and list things that interest them. You can then follow other people and discover other interesting events they list. There is no RSVP features; instead we try to direct people back to the original home of this event, wherever that is.</p>
<p>It’s intended not to only rely on people adding events by hand, but to encourage other people to publish event open data it can reuse. It can import from iCal, and it has a full write API and some existing bots that scrape information from other websites (with backlinks).</p>
<p>There is basic federation, but, er, not with ActivityPub yet - that’s something I want to support in the future. Expect more questions <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/events-and-discovering-relevant-information-later/1114">like this one</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s early days and there are many rough edges, but I’m just going to keep working on it slowly. I’m interested to chat with others working on event discovery, and interested in anything to encourage more open data on events!</p>

          <title>Easing the onboarding of new developers to the Fediverse</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[aschrijver]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Community</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>(This is a continuation of <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/discussing-onboarding-for-developers/61" class="inline-onebox">Discussing onboarding for developers</a> which veered into technical discussion)</p>
<h2>TL;DR</h2>
<p>Onboarding new devs to AP/Fediverse is a weak spot that is hampering the evolution (speed) of the ecosystem. Information is super-fragmented and many of the complexities are not readily obvious. Starting new projects is an adventure for the brave.</p>
<p>There are efforts to improve this, but time-constraints of experts and - in general - lack of appetite to do the work involved, means this process is very slow.</p>
<p>What can we do to change this?</p>
<h2>Objective</h2>
<ul>
<li>Set up a good-enough organization to start with</li>
<li>Devise a process to make crowdsourcing of dev-docs easy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I continuously witness would-be AP devs struggling. The <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/56c17fb8-bf55-4963-9d4e-e6345bee8de4" rel="nofollow noopener">newbie experience</a> to AP is not good. On the fedi itself I see people asking questions, and they don’t know about the existence of SocialHub or the Feneas forums. Devs literally have to look <em>everywhere</em> to get their info together, delve into various codebases, reverse engineer for their own use case. Want to implement C2S? A lucky person finds <a class="mention" href="/u/yvolk">@yvolk</a> issue <a href="https://github.com/andstatus/andstatus/issues/499" rel="nofollow noopener">#499</a> to analyse. OAuth2? Webfinger? NodeInfo? Plan some days to do your spikes…</p>
<p>Much of the knowledge remains stuck in github issues, matrix chat rooms, or even in this forum like with e.g. the <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/groups-implementation/591">Groups implementation</a> (still ongoing, but will the results be summarized somewhere?).</p>
<p>Ongoing developments regarding the future of the specs are even harder to come by. Extensibility, shards, capabilities, encryption, forgefed, etc. etc. Seems to me that lots of the discussion is not easy to come by for the (casually) interested, unless one dedicates to become deeply involved.</p>
<p>What is needed is a one-stop-shop to drill-down into all of this. A place that is maintained and up-to-date. A hard thing, because there is lotsa work involved.</p>
<h2>Current efforts</h2>
<p>On SocialHub <a class="mention" href="/u/nedjo">@nedjo</a> started the <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/guide-for-new-activitypub-implementers/479" class="inline-onebox">Guide for new ActivityPub implementers</a> wiki post (to which I make occasional updates) which is slated to become part (presumably) of fediverse.rocks once/if this site gets an overhaul. <a href="https://activitypub.rocks">ActivityPub Rocks</a> has best SEO for ‘ActivityPub’ search term (<span class="hashtag">#1</span> on DDG, <span class="hashtag">#4</span> on Google) and it is a pity that the site looks so… bare.</p>
<p>I recently started helping out with improving the <a href="https://git.feneas.org/feneas/fediverse/-/wikis/home" rel="nofollow noopener">fediverse wiki</a> (research area for fediverse.party). <a href="https://fediverse.party" rel="nofollow noopener">Fediverse Party</a> has best SEO for ‘Fediverse’ search term (# 1 on DDG and Google) and is great for fediverse end-users with their nice UX and all. I opened an <a href="https://git.feneas.org/feneas/fediverse/-/issues/28" rel="nofollow noopener">issue</a> proposing for fediverse.party to also target developers and extend the site accordingly.</p>
<p>Either of these two, or both, could be top-level homes for AP/Fediverse developers.</p>
<h2>WDYT?</h2>
<p>I am not an ActivityPub expert (but a big fediverse advocate, and very concerned <a href="https://community.humanetech.com/u/aschrijver/summary" rel="nofollow noopener">humanetech</a> proponent). I am sure y’all have concrete plans already, better ideas than me, and I’d love to hear your opinions and ideas <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/smiley.png?v=9" title=":smiley:" class="emoji" alt=":smiley:"></p>
