            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/cjs">@cjs</a>,</p>
<p>Only now do I discover the <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/go-fed-work-tracker-megathread/1170">Go-Fed Work Tracker Megathread</a> and the grant proposal part:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Write <a href="https://nlnet.nl/propose/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">NGI0 Discovery</a> grant proposals:
<ul>
<li>For ActivityPub <a href="https://github.com/go-fed/testsuite" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">testsuite</a> completion</li>
<li>For engineering of an OCAP-based transport/routing protocol based off of <a href="https://github.com/cjslep/eris" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">eris</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cjslep/scr" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">scr</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I would be very motivated to work with you on a grant application to implement <a href="https://discourse.gitea.io/t/forgefed-federation-in-gitea/1157" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">federation in Gitea with go-fed</a>. I have <a href="https://forum.fedeproxy.eu/c/funding/5" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">some experience</a> and although I do not really enjoy the administrative process (I’m a developer at heart), I acknowledge that there is value in <a href="https://forum.fedeproxy.eu/uploads/short-url/67QsDhlh47dpvuJxZf4hAsffZF9.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">clearly articulating the goals and outline the process to get there</a>.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge there is no ongoing call for proposal at the moment, therefore no pressure, which I like (being extremely bad at doing things at the last minute). There will however surely be at least a few open calls by the end of the year and it would help continue the effort that will hopefully be bootstrapped if a developer is motivated to take baby steps with <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/14186" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the seed funding</a> (tiny tiny seed <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/seedling.png?v=9" title=":seedling:" class="emoji" alt=":seedling:"> <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) that was made available this week to work on federation for Gitea.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<h2><a href="https://opencollective.com/go-fed-activitypub-labs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Go-Fed ActivityPub Labs OpenCollective</a></h2>
<p>The <a href="https://opencollective.com/go-fed-activitypub-labs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Go-Fed ActivityPub Labs OpenCollective</a> is set up to push for free (libre) and accessible ActivityPub application development. The Go-Fed ActivityPub Labs Collective aims to cover many open and transparent human activities around ActivityPub development, including a core focus around open source software written in Golang.</p>
<p>This Collective aims to do lightweight accounting to ensure the community is fiscally healthy and capable of supporting multiple kinds of work, not just code contributions.</p>
<h3>Contacts</h3>
<p>Matrix: <code>#go-fed:feneas.org</code><br>
Individuals:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>@cj@mastodon.technology</code></li>
</ul>
<h3>Operations</h3>
<p>Right now it is just <a class="mention" href="/u/cjs">@cjs</a> maintaining the Collective and doing core work. The goal is to better finance and incentivize others who wish to contribute to the community, including but not merely limited to coding contributions. <a class="mention" href="/u/cjs">@cjs</a> counts his blessings and is currently able to reimburse the OpenCollective for his time, to better stretch the fiscal contributions towards other efforts and other people. Life happens, and this blessing is not a perpetual certainty.</p>
<p>The OpenCollective aims to do some very basic accounting and reporting so that some funds can be set aside and budgeted for larger chunks of work. However, we do not want to introduce too much red tape, so we split work into <em>Budgeted</em> and <em>Unbudgeted</em> items. <em>Budgeted work</em> simply has some degree of funding earmarked for it. <em>Unbudgeted work</em> is still paid work, it just comes out of a general pool of money.</p>
<h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
<p>To be eligible for expense reimbursement, folks are expected to follow the <a href="https://github.com/go-fed/activity/blob/c7bbac61b652d31589f6744937369164ca36ea59/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Code of Conduct</a> when conducting their work.</p>
<h3>How To Get Involved</h3>
<p>If you’d like to learn more about the collective or donate, check out the <a href="https://opencollective.com/go-fed-activitypub-labs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OpenCollective page</a>. Since everything is done transparently and in the open, there are no donation tiers: donate what you wish, when you desire to.</p>
<p>If you’d like to tackle some work, either by pitching an idea of your own, discussing existing work items, or simply browse what’s been identified, head on over to the <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/go-fed-work-tracker-megathread/1170">Go-Fed Work Tracker Megathread</a>.</p>
<p>If you’d like to submit an expense, please head over to the <a href="https://opencollective.com/go-fed-activitypub-labs" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">OpenCollective page</a> and submit an expense.</p>

          <title>Unofficial Test Suite (go-fed/testsuite)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[cjs]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Go-Fed</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’ve heard there’s still trouble getting the official test suite up and running in its original form. I don’t want to detract from that effort, if it is still going on.</p>
<p>However, I did want to have a bit more of an automated experience. And, in a great exercise of NIH syndrome, I started hacking on go-fed/testsuite, built on go-fed: <a href="https://github.com/go-fed/testsuite" rel="nofollow noopener">https://github.com/go-fed/testsuite</a></p>
<p>When a user wants to begin testing their AP application, the server launches a TestRunner, which entirely contains its own hermetic environment: an isolated in-memory DB, isolated web serving paths, isolated AP actors. Yes, it basically spins up a whole S2S+C2S “federated app” that acts as a giant shim for the tests to leverage. Yay for the go-fed library!</p>
<p>Here’s a sample screenshot of the very bare-bones UI showing that a test needs further input and is awaiting the user to input more. There’s a table of pending tests (blocked by the instructions or simply being late in the order) and a table of completed tests:<br>
<div class="lightbox-wrapper"><a class="lightbox" href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/uploads/default/original/1X/d97fa74f1b2bd45c9681dcd169649f1414162909.png" data-download-href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/uploads/default/d97fa74f1b2bd45c9681dcd169649f1414162909" title="Screen Shot 2020-07-15 at 21.39.31"><img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d97fa74f1b2bd45c9681dcd169649f1414162909_2_690x391.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-07-15 at 21.39.31" data-base62-sha1="v256FsfEvlspuEWrbgFf82pm4bL" width="690" height="391" srcset="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d97fa74f1b2bd45c9681dcd169649f1414162909_2_690x391.png, https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d97fa74f1b2bd45c9681dcd169649f1414162909_2_1035x586.png 1.5x, https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d97fa74f1b2bd45c9681dcd169649f1414162909_2_1380x782.png 2x" data-small-upload="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/uploads/default/optimized/1X/d97fa74f1b2bd45c9681dcd169649f1414162909_2_10x10.png"><div class="meta"><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-far-image svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#far-image"></use></svg><span class="filename">Screen Shot 2020-07-15 at 21.39.31</span><span class="informations">1433×814 60.1 KB</span><svg class="fa d-icon d-icon-discourse-expand svg-icon" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#discourse-expand"></use></svg></div></a></div></p>
<p>If a test succeeds or fails, each test has a very detailed log of what it was doing to execute those tests, so end-users can get an idea of what was going on and where things started going wrong:<br>

<p>Clearly there’s more work to be done (more tests to be written, a hell of a better UI to make). I would definitely appreciate help if folks are interested.</p>
<p>It is my hope that most of these tests are automated and there are as few “on your honor, check the box” type of questions as possible.</p>
<p>All of this was hugely inspired by the original official test suite, thank you to those who built it (<a class="mention" href="/u/cwebber">@cwebber</a> I believe!).</p>

          <title>Discussion: A Next Step In Federated Data Protections</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[cjs]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Go-Fed</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am building out <code>go-fed/apcore</code>. <code>apcore</code> is a server framework that provides both an ActivityPub server and an OAuth2 server in one, with support for things like webfinger, NodeInfo2 (soon), http signatures, some basic ActivityPub handlers. It’s super hand-holdy. I’d like to propose a flow like the following to include in <code>apcore</code> and welcome feedback.</p>
<h1>motivating scenario</h1>
<p>Given: I am operating an <code>apcore</code> app on Instance A; there is User B on an <code>apcore</code> app on Instance B; User B has Data1, Data3, and Data4 that has federated to my Instance A:</p>
<ol start="0">
<li>User B goes to Instance A</li>
<li>User B clicks on a “federated data checkup” button (I don’t have a good name for this)</li>
<li>This initiates the OAuth2 Authorization Code grant flow between Instance A and Instance B. Instance A redirects User B to Instance B, who logs into Instance B, and Instance A obtains an authorization code. In this case, an authorization code is given, but <strong>no scopes are granted</strong>. Instance A just knows Instance B said “User B is authorized to act as User B” for the current web session only (the only time the auth code is tied to the user).</li>
<li>Now User B can do the following, until their session ends:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Request Instance A to count/list all federated Activities and Objects where User B is the <code>author</code> or <code>attributedTo</code>.</li>
<li>Request Instance A to delete some/all of the data counted/listed, but inform them that Instance A may still fetch and cache their content in the course of routine operations serving its users.</li>
</ul>
<p>The benefits to User B:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never has to create an account on Instance A</li>
<li>Does not grant Instance A any scoped powers</li>
<li>Sees their data on other instances (digital right to know)</li>
<li>Have the power to self-service (digital right to delete) their data cached on other instances.</li>
</ul>
<h1>a big can of worms</h1>
<p>In addition to listing and deleting their cached data, <code>apcore</code> could also let User B opt into an option that says:</p>
<ul>
<li>Never process my federated data. I understand Instance A can still process derivative content produced by others that references or contains my data (such as Announces). This requires Instance A to record me as opting in.</li>
</ul>
<h1>how is this different than blocks?</h1>
<p>Blocking, muting, ignoring, or any other of these sorts of actions would, using the scenario above, be on <em>Instance B</em>. This focuses on a different problem (a user’s digital rights) and attempts to expand it to peer instances, so this would bring <em>User B’s</em> digital right to <em>Instance A</em> as well. However, there are similar end-result effects.</p>
<h1>closing thoughts</h1>
<p>This is a path I’d like to go towards with <code>apcore</code> if possible, so that all app developers that use it are encouraged to interoperate and respect user’s digital rights in this way.</p>
<p>I understand other federated software isn’t necessarily an oauth2 server and would require work to reach par on this.</p>

            <p>The past month has been:</p>
<ul>
<li>Implementing more of <code>apcore</code>, the FLOSS ActivityPub server framework in Go. Goal is to basically be plug-in-your-mux for web handling, plug in functions for ActivityPub processing, and just launch (with either S2S / C2S or both). Provides lots of sensible behavioral defaults for the <code>activity</code> library, lets admins have lots of configuration options, etc…</li>
<li>Improving <code>activity/astool</code> code generation. This has been a big one, formally supporting the <code>security</code> ontology (which has type-less “types”), and trying to cram JSON-LD’s square peg into static typing’s round hole, but investing early on in the multi-vocabulary understanding of the tool paid off rather well otherwise. Code generation as metaprogramming still is a sucky problem.</li>
<li>Fixed a hash sum bug in <code>httpsig</code> for Digests. Proof that the <code>hash.Hash</code> interface in go was foot-gun designed.  Yes, <code>httpsig</code> now does both HTTP Signatures and Digests, but still behind a very simple interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’d like to thank Ben for stepping up and filing issues against Go-fed as he’s been building out a Guild Wars 2  guild application of some sort.</p>
<p>Also I am slightly late to the topic <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/help-needed-with-pherephone-development-boosts-not-federating-to-pleroma/145">here</a> but apparently go-fed’s serialization strategy of non-functional properties can cause problems in pleroma. That’s a TODO of some sort for someone, I’m sure.</p>
<p>This winter I hope to get the <code>apcore/example</code> live.</p>
<p>No matter if it is the <code>activity</code>, <code>httpsig</code>, <code>apcore</code>, or any sub-packages, always open to collaboration.</p>
