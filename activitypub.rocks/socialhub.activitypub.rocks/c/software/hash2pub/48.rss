            <p>a fully-decentralised relay for global hashtag federation</p>
<p>It allows querying and subscribing to all posts of a certain hashtag and is implemented in Haskell.</p>
<p>The implementation is work-in-progress.</p>
<p>Use this category for architecture discussions, implementation considerations and later on for support requests or bug reports.</p>
<p>The code is still developed in a closed repo until ready.</p>
<h3>More about the project</h3>
<p>I proposed my decentralised architecture of AP relays at ActivityPubConf 2019. For further information about it take a look at my <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/340eb706-28c0-4a43-9364-700297ca96cb" rel="nofollow noopener">talk there</a> (30min) or take a look at <a href="https://git.orlives.de/schmittlauch/paper_hashtag_federation" rel="nofollow noopener">the full paper</a>.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have finally started implementing my ActivityPub relay that is going to allow subscription to hashtags and querying a more or less consistent list of posts of that hashtag.<br>
The current working title for that software is <strong>Hash2Pub</strong>.</p>
<p>The final goal for that project is to have a component that runs alongside to the main AP server and talks to it using the existing ActivityPub relay mechanism. But all these relay instances build a fully-decentralised DHT infrastructure to manage the assignment, resolution, relaying and storage of posts with a certain hashtag.<br>
As I am doing this implementation for a study research project, the current phase of implementation unfortunately will focus on functionality that is necessary for proper evaluation, simulation and profiling of my architecture.</p>
<h2>Give me some feedback!</h2>
<p>Iâ€™ll be posting about the current state of the implementation, design choices I made and open questions. If you disagree with one of my choices or can provide valuable input to one of these questions, please let me know.</p>
<p>I am implementing the project in Haskell, so if there are experienced Haskell programmers around I may decide to already publish the code and let you take a look at it. (implementation is currently happening in a closed repo as it is interwoven with my real-name study publications. It will be released under AGPL once ready.)</p>
