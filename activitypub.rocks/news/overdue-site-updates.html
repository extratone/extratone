     <a href="let-us-meet-on-socialhub.html">SocialHub launched</a>.
     This has been a successful community-run resource for discussing
     ActivityPub development and its future.</p><p>Since that time, a number of updates have been requested and suggested
     of this site.
     After significant delays (sorry), the frontpage of
     <a href="../index.html">activitypub.rocks</a>
     now
     <a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/activitypub.rocks/-/commit/391cfae9d208eddb51b21c06032307f8f45d9c35">better reflects</a>
     the community-hosted resources where ActivityPub-oriented
     advancement and development have been happening.
     In particular, the link to the test suite, which has been down for
     ages (yes, sorry, we know),
     now instead points to the most excellent
     <a href="https://test.activitypub.dev/">test.activitypub.dev</a>.
     Massive thank you to
     <a href="https://mastodon.technology/@cj">cj</a>
     of
     <a href="https://go-fed.org/">go-fed</a>
     for providing this excellent and much-needed resource.</p><p>ActivityPub has come a long way since the days when this website
     first launched... at that time, the primary focus of this website
     was advocacy for the hope that ActivityPub would become a
     W3C-recommended standard.
     We're well past those days now... the ActivityPub community is a
     flourishing one, with many implementations and more interest and
     users than ever.
     Today's update makes a few small updates to better reflect such
     changing reality, and we hope to do so more moving forward.
     At the same time, we're also happy that this website had to be
     updated to point to many external, community-oriented resources...
     a sign of a healthy community.
     May the future of ActivityPub be as bright as its present!</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/activitypub.rocks">Site contents</a> dual licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 4.0 International</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">the GNU GPL, version 3 or any later version</a>.
