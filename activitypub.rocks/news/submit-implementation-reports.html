         Oops!</em></p><p>We're happy to announce that ActivityPub is now
     <a href="https://github.com/w3c/activitypub/blob/gh-pages/implementation-reports/TEMPLATE.md">open for implementation report submissions</a>!
     In order for ActivityPub to transition from being a Candidate Recommendation
     to being a Proposed Recommendation, we need submissions showing that people
     are using the standard, and help identifying which features are used.
     (Filling in the implementation report has an added bonus: alongside
              following the standard, it's a helpful checklist to make sure
              you're implementing all the things you meant to!)</p><p>A huge thank you to
     <a href="http://bengo.is/">Benjamin Goering</a>
     for adding the implementation report template, which has helped
     tremendously!
     You rock, bengo!</p><p>What's coming next?
     The test suite should be out as soon as possible!
     So if you start implementing now, you'll be able to run against
     the test suite very shortly!</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/activitypub.rocks">Site contents</a> dual licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 4.0 International</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">the GNU GPL, version 3 or any later version</a>.
