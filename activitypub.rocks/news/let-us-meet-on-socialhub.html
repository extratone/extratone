     community, for a few months we have revived the
     <a href="../../socialhub.activitypub.rocks/index.html@u=how.html">SocialHub</a>
     where developers, implementors, and anyone interested in the present
     and future of the W3C Recommendation gather, discuss issues, and
     collaborate with a kind and cooperative spirit to bring forth the
     best of what our collective intelligence can invent.</p><p>The new SocialHub, like the previous one we had to abandon, runs
     Discourse, a forum software that can be used via email, but shines
     on the web, and is
     <a href="../../socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/software/discourse@u=how.html">about to implement ActivityPub</a>
     support!</p><p>If you are implementing ActivityPub-compatible software, you're
     very welcome to
     <a href="../../socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/last-tasks-before-launch/78/15@u=how.html">settle home on the SocialHub</a>
     to give your project visibility and point potential contributors
     to your own community's online resources (repositories, blog,
     forum, etc.). You can even use a subcategory dedicated to your
     software implementation to discuss ActivityPub-specific details
     with other developers for interoperability with your software.</p><p>Non-technical people are also welcome! There's a lot to discuss,
     study, and invent in the growing Fediverse that has no equivalent in
     the surveillance capitalist counter-part that we're escaping from.
     Our
     <a href="../../socialhub.activitypub.rocks/c/fediversity@u=how.html">#Fediversity</a>
     welcomes researchers, social scientists, journalists, and collectives interested
     in adopting ActivityPub for their own needs.</p><p>We're also discussing how to

     for the world. Keep your eyes peeled!</p><p>You may
