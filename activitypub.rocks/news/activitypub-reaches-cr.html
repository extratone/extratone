     <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
     has officially reached
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsCR">Candidate Recommendation</a>
     status!
     This is a huge milestone, signaling that ActivityPub has moved to a
     point of stability where we're no longer planning major revisions
     and would like to see as many projects move to implement as possible.</p><p>In other words, now's a great time for <em>YOU</em> to start implementing!
     Head on over to
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">the standard</a>
     and start building!</p><p>We're also planning tools to
     <a href="../test/index.html">test</a>
     your implementations soon, and
     <a href="http://activitypub.rocks/implementation-report/">submit implementation reports</a>.
     There's a lot to do, but we're on track towards being a proposed
     recommendation to the W3C!</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/activitypub.rocks">Site contents</a> dual licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 4.0 International</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">the GNU GPL, version 3 or any later version</a>.
