     <a href="https://test.activitypub.rocks/">ActivityPub test suite</a>
     is up and running.
     Likewise, so is the
     <a href="../implementation-report.html">implementation reports page</a>!</p><p>As it turns out, these go hand in hand.
     If you go through the test suite, it'll generate an
     implementation report that you can easily submit.
     At the time of writing we have three implementation reports up,
     but we could really use more!
     Are you working on an ActivityPub implementation?
     Please submit one!
     Not only does it help ActivityPub get through the last leg of
     its standards process (we need to wrap up over the next few weeks!)
     but don't you want to look cool by showing up as an implementation
     on the
     <a href="../implementation-report.html">implementation reports page</a>?
     ;)</p><p>Note that it's perfectly acceptable to incrementally submit
     reports... if it turns out that your implementation doesn't
     pass as many items on the implementation report as you'd like,
     it's okay to re-submit later.
     (At the time of writing, my own implementation Pubstrate has
     a number of items marked as not passing that I'll be getting
     passing over the next few weeks!)</p><p>One note is that the test suite has two components: some of
     the tests are automated, and some of them prompt the user to
     manually test something and confirm/deny that it is passing.
     We would like to have full automated coverage in the future,
     but the working group agreed that since time is limited and
     interoperability is already being demonstrated externally
     through federation etc, this would be good enough for now.
     But it would be good to get more automated!</p><p>Anyway,
     we're in the last mile of getting ActivityPub out the door.
     And if you're an implementer, you can help us get there.
     Submit implementation reports, and help us, the world,
     ActivityPub's standardization effort, and your project's own
     vanity by getting an implementation report up there!</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/activitypub.rocks">Site contents</a> dual licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 4.0 International</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">the GNU GPL, version 3 or any later version</a>.
