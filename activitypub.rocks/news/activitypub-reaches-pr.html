     <a href="activitypub-reaches-cr.html">reaching Candidate Recommendation status</a>
     we're pleased to announce that
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/">ActivityPub</a>
     has now reached
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsPR">Proposed Recommendation status</a>!
     (We actually moved to Proposed Recommendation status
      <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2017/PR-activitypub-20171205/">on Tuesday</a>
      but... sometimes getting out news is a slow process.)
     This means that as far as the
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/wiki/Socialwg/">Social Working Group</a>
     is concerned, the group is confident that ActivityPub is ready to
     become a real specification.
     Now we wait and cross our fingers for the W3C Membership and W3C
     Management to approve.
     Assuming all goes well, that would mean moving to
     <a href="https://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#RecsPR">Recommendation status</a>
     sometime over the next couple of months.</p><p>In the meanwhile we're seeing the number of
     <a href="../implementation-report.html">implementations of ActivityPub to be growing</a>.
     What exciting new ActivityPub-using projects are on the horizon?
     We hope to see you submit your implementation to the implementation
     reports page next!</p></div></div></div></div><div class="footer"><a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/activitypub.rocks">Site contents</a> dual licensed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 4.0 International</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html">the GNU GPL, version 3 or any later version</a>.
