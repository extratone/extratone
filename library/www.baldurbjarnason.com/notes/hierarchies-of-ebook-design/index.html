 <p>
  What follows are two hierarchies of ebook design, outlines that climb from the
  trivial and decorative to the integral and necessary.
</p>

<p>
  The visual design examples are books that I happen to have on my desk. The
  interactive design examples are, for the most part, major titles from
  interactive media history.
</p>

<h3 id="visualdesign">Visual design</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    All meaning is in the text. A good default stylesheet is preferred over
    having to design and test a custom one. (Most novels.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Type and cadence has meaning and connotations that a default stylesheet
    can&#8217;t convey. (Bringhurst&#8217;s
    <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881792063/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332174288&amp;sr=8-1"
      ><em>The Elements of Typographic Style</em></a
    >.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Strong and distinctive aesthetics are a part of the message. (Twyla
    Tharp&#8217;s
    <a
      href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Creative-Habit-Learn-Life/dp/0743235274/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332174337&amp;sr=1-1"
      ><em>The Creative Habit</em></a
    >. Constance Hale&#8217;s
    <a
      href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Sin-Syntax-Constance-Hale/dp/0767903099/ref=sr_1_1_title_0_main?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332174376&amp;sr=1-1"
      ><em>Sin and Syntax</em></a
    >)
  </li>
  <li>
    Design as UI, essential to the reading, but doesn&#8217;t require a complex
    layout. (Most computer/programming books. Jesse James Garrett&#8217;s
    <a
      href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Elements-User-Experience-User-Centered-Design/dp/0321683684/ref=tmm_pap_title_0"
      ><em>The Elements of User Experience</em></a
    >.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Design is dense with meaning, fancy layout needs. (Tufte&#8217;s books.
    David Pye&#8217;s
    <a
      href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Nature-Art-Workmanship-David/dp/0713689315/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332259792&amp;sr=8-1"
      ><em>The Nature and Art of Workmanship</em></a
    >. Josef Müller-Brockmann&#8217;s
    <a
      href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Grid-Systems-Graphic-Design-Typographers/dp/3721201450/ref=sr_1_14?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1332174259&amp;sr=8-14"
      ><em>Grid systems in graphic design</em></a
    >.)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Ereader platforms serve the first type of ebook very well and, since most
  designers who think they&#8217;re working on type 2 books are actually working
  on type 1 books, they serve type 2 books very well as well.
</p>

<p>
  (Bringhurst&#8217;s book was the only book I found on my desk where the
  typographic style was, appropriately, an integral part of the book&#8217;s
  meaning. I&#8217;m sure there are others, but they aren&#8217;t common. In any
  case, the web platform isn&#8217;t capable of delivering the typographic
  nuance necessary for type 2 designs. Not until the spec for CSS
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/-moz-font-feature-settings"
    >font-feature-settings</a
  >
  settles and is more broadly implemented.)
</p>

<p>
  Type 3 books are largely let down by ereader platforms as all of them require
  the ability to adjust margins and set backgrounds properly, something that
  <em>all</em> major ereader platforms prohibit, even iBooks and Kindle Fire.
</p>

<p>
  (I&#8217;m counting Apple&#8217;s .ibooks format as a separate platform. It
  isn&#8217;t a major one yet.)
</p>

<p>
  Type 4 and 5 books are possible to a degree in Apple&#8217;s .ibook format,
  but even those are partially let down by its inability to use embedded fonts.
  (Just try and open one up to embed fonts. Crasherama.) Those books would also,
  unfortunately, only work on iPads.
</p>

<p>
  Some of these books (types 3, 4, and 5) are available on the Kindle platform
  but have had their personality and style completely removed in their ebook
  versions. Charging anything <em>at all</em> for these mutilated remains is too
  much. That publishers pretend that these editions are in any way equivalent to
  their printed versions borders on criminal fraud.
</p>

<p>
  Even worse: There is no way for readers to discover which is which when they
  browse ebookstores. They aren&#8217;t given the tools to tell the books that
  have been mutilated in their ebook transition from those that haven&#8217;t.
</p>

<p>
  Fixed layout ebooks, as implemented by Apple and Amazon, don&#8217;t solve any
  of these design problems as they are all pre-paginated. These books are
  text-heavy. Doing them in fixed-layouts would be insane. It would prevent text
  from reflowing when resized (where resizing is even possible) and involve a
  massive amount of work to create a sub-par book.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/fxl/">IDPF&#8217;s Fixed Layout spec</a> would
  solve most of these problems because it adds several important capabilities
  that Amazon&#8217;s and Apple&#8217;s implementations lack:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    You can mix pre-paginated fixed layout chapters with reflowable chapters.
    This lets you drop into a fixed layout for sections with complex
    requirements.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can create adaptive &#8216;fixed&#8217; layout chapters, ones that
    don&#8217;t define a fixed viewport but use media queries to adapt the
    design to the ereader.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can use <code>overflow: scroll</code> to create chapters that scroll
    like web-pages.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  These three capabilities mean that IDPF&#8217;s Fixed Layout specification is
  actually useful to regular books, not just illustrated books. It would let a
  regular text-oriented ebook have a beautiful title page and elegant section
  divisions using fixed layout pages, something that many designers have been
  struggling with during the entirety of the ebook transition so far.
</p>

<p>
  Incompatible file formats reduce innovation and harm the ebook market. The
  time that ebook designers spend implementing several versions of their ebooks
  is time that isn&#8217;t spent on finessing the design and implementing new,
  innovative, features.
</p>

<p>
  It holds back the entire ebook market and sabotages the transition from print
  to digital.
</p>

<p>
  At least during the browser wars we only had to deal with two incompatible
  approaches.
</p>

<p>
  Fully supporting the IDPF Fixed Layout spec and letting designers both adjust
  page margins and set full-bleed backgrounds would cover more than 90% of the
  publishing industry&#8217;s visual design needs.
</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="aside:full-bleedbackgroundsandmargins">
  Aside: Full-bleed backgrounds and margins
</h3>

<p>
  I&#8217;ve been looking into how ereaders handle backgrounds set on the HTML
  or BODY elements of an xhtml file. After trying my
  <a href="../../bgtests.epub">test</a> <a href="../../bgtests2.epub">files</a> in several
  readers I can only come to two conclusions.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The ereaders&#8217; overrides result in a non-standard mess that is both
    ugly and can result in the body text becoming invisible. Neither does the
    reader any favours.
  </li>
  <li>
    There is no consistency from ereader to ereader on how they override margins
    and HTML/BODY backgrounds.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  When I first started investigating how ereaders implement page margins and
  backgrounds I was under the impression that their overrides caused them to,
  essentially, set the HTML element&#8217;s
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS/background-clip"
    >background-clip property</a
  >
  to &#8216;content-box&#8217;.
</p>

<p>I was mistaken.</p>

<p>
  My guess now is that their implementation is based on an interpretation of
  <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/page.html"
    >CSS 2.1&#8217;s section on paged media</a
  >
  where the content is clipped by the page&#8217;s margins. Ereader vendors seem
  to take this as an indication that backgrounds in on-screen paginated contexts
  should be clipped to the page&#8217;s margins as well.
</p>

<p>
  That is, I&#8217;d argue, a misinterpretation. CSS 2.1&#8217;s paged media
  section is discussing printed media, where almost no printer shipped to
  consumers can print full-bleed backgrounds. The spec as defined is merely
  putting order to a real-world limitation that cannot be removed.
</p>

<p>
  This limitation does not apply to on-screen paginated contexts and so in my
  view the only correct thing would be to render the backgrounds set on the HTML
  element edge-to-edge, i.e. full-bleed. Maintaining consistency with default
  screen rendering behaviour should trump the print media edge case.
</p>

<p>But using CSS 2.1&#8217;s section on page margins seems sensible.</p>

<p>
  Allowing authors to set the page&#8217;s margins using <code>@page</code> and
  a full-bleed background using the html selector would solve a lot of design
  problems ebook developers are facing.
</p>

<p>
  And it would have the added benefit of being entirely compliant with the CSS
  2.1 standard.
</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="interactivedesign">Interactive design</h3>

<p>
  True to the non-linear nature of interactivity, this isn&#8217;t a true
  hierarchy. More of a bag of interrelated goodies that you can mix and match.
  Nevertheless, they are listed in the order of increasing impact.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>None. Just a book. Nothing wrong with that.</li>
  <li>
    Decorative. Added video or 3D models where illustrations would do. Links
    used as simple references. (Most &#8216;enhanced&#8217; ebooks.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Functional. Important parts of the book require interactivity.
    (Apple&#8217;s .ibooks textbooks. Voyager&#8217;s expanded ebooks.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Structural. Interactivity is integrated into the book&#8217;s structure.
    (Books with extensive cross-references.
    <a href="http://www.rivertext.com/monks.html"><em>If Monks had Macs</em></a
    >.
    <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/Afternoon.html"
      ><em>Afternoon</em></a
    >.
    <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/catalog/PatchworkGirl.html"
      ><em>Patchwork Girl</em></a

    <a href="http://www.touchpress.com/titles/solarsystem/"
      ><em>Solar System</em></a
    >. <a href="http://www.touchpress.com/titles/skulls/"><em>Skulls</em></a
    >.
    <a href="http://www.touchpress.com/titles/theelements/"
      ><em>The Elements</em></a
    >.
    <a href="http://www.touchpress.com/titles/thewasteland/"
      ><em>The Wasteland</em></a
    >.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Networked. Outside meaning enters into the book, surrounds and frames parts
    of it. (Kindle notes and popular highlights.)
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Most attempts at ebook interactivity over the last few years have been
  <em>decorative</em>. Add a few videos and gloss to an established text, raise
  the price, and hope nobody notices that it&#8217;s a lazy ripoff. Most of the
  ereader platforms allow for this kind of interactivity, at least to a limited
  extent.
</p>

<p>
  With Apple&#8217;s announcement of the .ibooks format we&#8217;ve begun to see
  renewed interest in <em>functional interactivity</em>, where widgets add
  substantially to the meaning and important parts of the text are delivered
  through interactivity.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Structural interactivity</em> is the kind that is the most difficult to
  implement and has drawn the most attention.
</p>

<p>
  How difficult is it in practice? Most of the major titles of this type come
  from a single developer: <a href="http://www.touchpress.com/">Touch Press</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Most developers misunderstand <em>networked interactivity</em>. They almost
  always take it to mean that data can be pulled into the book and the book
  changed in some suitable way.
</p>

<p>
  What it actually means is different: Networked interactivity is about
  re-contextualising data.
</p>

<p>
  Most of the time this means data that&#8217;s pulled from or pushed into the
  network, but that&#8217;s not a requirement of the basic concept.
</p>

<p>
  These types of interactivity are easily implemented on the web with standard
  tech but the situation in ebooks isn&#8217;t nearly that simple, for a variety
  of reasons:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Most ebook platforms don&#8217;t offer javascript or only offer a
    non-standard selection of javascript APIs (like iBooks).
  </li>
  <li>
    App platforms have a larger mindshare and offer a much larger, more unified,
    user base. They also offer
    <a href="http://developer.android.com/index.html"
      >developer documentation</a
    >
    and
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/technologies/tools/">extensive tools</a
    >, something that the ebook world doesn&#8217;t offer at all.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most javascript touch APIs are non-standard and many are
    <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/45559/status"
      >patent-encumbered</a
    >. It is almost impossible to implement non-proprietary interactivity that
    builds on the tablet experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most of the attempts at rich interactivity in ebooks so far have been
    proprietary extensions (flash embeds in Adobe Reader and Apple&#8217;s
    .ibooks format).
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The complete absence of
  <a
    href="../treat-ebook-developers-as-developers/index.html"
    >developer documentation or tools</a
  >
  in the ebook field is a large part of what makes app- or web-based interactive
  books so attractive to publishers. Add to that the iPad&#8217;s large,
  relatively uniform, and paying user base and you begin to see why so many
  &#8216;enhanced ebook&#8217; efforts begin and end with native iPad apps.
</p>

<p>
  If you&#8217;re going to go proprietary, you go for the largest, best
  documented, most productive platform around.
</p>

<p>
  (This ties in with
  <a
    href="../treat-ebook-developers-as-developers/index.html#addendum"
    >my earlier theme</a
  >: ebook platforms are competing with other platforms, both for talent and for
  customers. A publisher&#8217;s biggest enemy isn&#8217;t Amazon but Angry
  Birds.)
</p>

<p>
  Approaches and tactics for ereader vendors, publishers, and readers need to be
  considered separately.
</p>

<h3 id="ereadervendors">Ereader vendors</h3>

<p>
  There are two approaches ereader vendors can and have taken in terms of
  interactivity:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Add capabilities to the platform that publishers and ebook developers can
    build on.
  </li>
  <li>Add interactive features directly to their apps and devices.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="capabilities">1. Capabilities</h4>

<p>
  Adding capabilities hasn&#8217;t really resulted in much. A bunch of titles
  appear that include video or Fancy New Widget™ but most of them are either
  unpolished or badly thought out. None of them play a major role in the sales
  charts.
</p>

<p>
  What else do you expect when we are given
  <a
    href="../treat-ebook-developers-as-developers/index.html"
    >poor documentation and no tools</a
  >?
</p>

<p>
  What else do you expect when you can&#8217;t even trust basic CSS formatting
  to be preserved across all of the major platforms?
</p>

<p>
  What else do you expect when we have to implement fixed layout books
  <em>at least</em> twice?
</p>

<p>
  Time that is wasted working blind, testing across half a dozen platforms with
  no tools to help you, and reimplementing the same fixed layout again and
  again, is time that doesn&#8217;t go into product development, doesn&#8217;t
  go into polishing the book, doesn&#8217;t go into play-testing widgets, and
  doesn&#8217;t go into turning a half-baked design into something fantastic
  that will blow the reader&#8217;s mind.
</p>

<p>
  <em>News flash:</em> Incompatible platform capabilities are a crap way to
  differentiate your product.
</p>

<p>
  Polish, however, is a great way to differentiate, to rise above the rest. If
  your implementation is the best, that&#8217;s a differentiator. Having the
  capability in the first place is a differentiator. (&#8220;X now supports
  videos in ebooks!&#8221;) Incompatible capabilities aren&#8217;t, because they
  <em>won&#8217;t get used</em>.
</p>

<p>
  All of the major platforms, Kindle, Kobo, Nook, and iBooks, can trust that –
  no matter how market share is distributed among them – publishers and ebook
  developers will test and try to make sure their books work on all four.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, that&#8217;s kind of the problem. Unless a capability is compatible
  across all of the major platforms that implement it, that capability will
  never see widespread and <em>profitable</em> use, because developer will
  either target a compatible subset of the feature, or they will do a simple
  design that is easy to port.
</p>

<p>
  So, a plea: when you add a capability to your platform, either make it
  compatible with existing capabilities on other platforms, base it on an
  existing standard, or make sure it can degrade gracefully. Then write some
  documentation. Then make some nice tools.
</p>

<p>
  (I.e. don&#8217;t do what Apple did with .ibooks and do a wholesale,
  incompatible, fork of a standard format. Extend the standard format in ways
  that tie into the built-in fallback capabilities.)
</p>

<p>
  Do this wrong and you&#8217;ll end up with a bunch of badly thought out titles
  languishing unsold on your servers. Do this right and you might end up
  enabling ebook genres that grow the ebook market by appealing to non-readers
  or satisfy needs readers didn&#8217;t know they had.
</p>

<h4 id="features">2. Features</h4>

<p>
  One area where ereader vendors have free reign in their attempts at
  interactivity is when it comes to implementing new features for their
  platforms.
</p>

<p>
  Kobo has been doing this in its effort to integrate facebook and gameification
  doohickeys, although I can&#8217;t really test it because I don&#8217;t use
  facebook and enjoy gameified UIs about as much as I would having my toenails
  chewed off by a badger.
</p>

<p>
  Which isn&#8217;t a bad thing, per se, for Kobo. For every person like me, who
  hates the direction they&#8217;ve gone into, there&#8217;s going to be at
  least one other person who thinks it&#8217; is exactly what they&#8217;ve been
  looking for&#8217;s the most brilliant thing since Spice Girls.
</p>

<p>
  Amazon has been going in this direction as well, albeit in much less intrusive
  and more usable way (at least for me, see what I said above about polarised
  opinions). Popular highlights, for example, is a clever use of network data,
  re-contextualised into the book for the curious.
</p>

<p>
  More interesting to me are the
  <a href="https://kindle.amazon.com/faq#PublicNotes0">Public Notes</a>, which
  are live, networked, footnotes. Imagine being able to issue a correction to a
  book and have it appear as a footnote in all copies of the book,
  automatically.
</p>

<p>
  They haven&#8217;t seen much uptake but I think that´s because they
  didn&#8217;t go far enough.
</p>

<p>
  I think that all books should have the Public Notes by its author enabled by
  default and I think that they should let authors use HTML in their public
  notes. They don&#8217;t need much HTML support: bold, italic, links, and maybe
  images. Send a plaintext version to legacy devices and the fancy HTML notes to
  newer ones. Then give authors a nice web-based GUI for creating and updating
  their notes.
</p>

<p>
  It&#8217;d be popular. But it&#8217;d have to be on by default, otherwise it
  won&#8217;t work.
</p>

<p>
  These suggestions and these tactics don&#8217;t apply to just Kobo and Kindle.
  Reading software has a long history of experimentation, starting with some of
  the early hypertext systems and continuing into the Multimedia CD-ROM era and
  that&#8217;s before you even get into the possibilities the internet offers.
</p>

<h3 id="publishers">Publishers</h3>

<p>
  The problem with generalising about publishers is that you can&#8217;t
  generalise about publishers. Big or small, they are all uniquely crazy.
</p>

<p>
  I don&#8217;t mean that as a bad thing. They have to be a bit crazy. Sane
  people pick easier industries to work in.
</p>

<p>
  I&#8217;m not going to go into specific implementation tactics. The options at
  the moment are very limited. You can do simple audio and video on most ereader
  platforms but for anything more than that you either need to go proprietary
  (.ibooks), online (a website) or native (iOS or Android app).
</p>

<p>This will change in the future but exactly how, we don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>
  Ignoring the technical side (yeah, I know, that&#8217;s ignoring
  <em>a lot</em>) the problem with interactivity can be broadly broken down into
  three areas:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Extending existing titles.</li>
  <li>Re-appropriating existing material.</li>
  <li>Original works.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="extendingexistingtitles">1. Extending existing titles</h4>

<p>
  Given that most publishers are built around making books, it&#8217;s
  understandable that their first attempts at interactivity involve extending
  those books, to promote them, add value, extend their shelf-life, etc..
</p>

<p>
  This rarely works.
  <a href="http://www.touchpress.com/titles/thewasteland/">It can</a>. But it
  usually doesn&#8217;t.
</p>

<p>There are a few good reasons why not:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Most of the material would add more value on the web. There is a
    considerable opportunity cost to locking a good author video inside a book
    when it could be on the web, promoting the book and increasing its sales.
  </li>
  <li>
    The books weren&#8217;t written with interactivity in mind and so
    don&#8217;t benefit.
  </li>
  <li>
    The mode switch from text to video, interactive maps, widgets, whatever is
    too disruptive because the writing style is too immersive. Multimodal
    interactivity requires compromises in all of the forms that are to be
    integrated. You can&#8217;t do full narrative videos. You can&#8217;t do
    detailed radio-style productions. You can&#8217;t do involved, deeply
    immersive, prose. You need to write differently and edit differently.
  </li>
  <li>
    It adds no value to the book. Seriously, why are you doing this? People want
    the damn story, not a grab-bag of your marketing materials bundled with
    their fantasy yarns.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Publishers who are focused on text-oriented books are better off spending
  their interactive efforts on making their websites interesting.
</p>

<p>
  The exception are, of course, illustrated books. The writing style and
  materials are more suited to multimedia and in some cases additional
  interactivity lets the original breathe, gives it the space it needs to do its
  concepts justice.
</p>

<p>
  The publishers whose backlists are full of these titles know this already and
  are way ahead of pundits like me. They have been quietly making the most of
  their titles, with none of the fanfare or massive expense that follows the
  more high-profile efforts by big publishers.
</p>

<h4 id="re-appropriatingexistingmaterial">
  2. Re-appropriating existing material
</h4>

<p>
  The world isn&#8217;t limited to books. A lot of companies own the rights to
  large libraries of film, video, audio, and short form text. Building original
  works with existing stuff is a lot easier than shooting, recording, and
  writing everything from scratch, and you have a lot more freedom to mess
  around and adapt everything to work in an interactive context.
</p>

<p>
  You still need developer talent and you can&#8217;t just recruit anybody.
  Building entertainment software requires a different skill- and mindset from
  that of building an ecommerce website. People that do entertainment-oriented
  interactive media are few and far between and usually get to work in
  environments that are considerably less frustrating than today&#8217;s ereader
  platforms.
</p>

<p>
  Which is why you end up seeing a lot of native apps or websites and very few
  interactive ebooks proper. The talent goes where the tools are.
</p>

<p>
  The alternative is to train your own people. Then you let your staff pad their
  CVs with a couple of your own titles before they head off into other fields.
  Fields that give their developers actual tools to accomplish their goals and
  documentation on how to get there.
</p>

<h4 id="originalworks">3. Original works</h4>

<p>
  The problem with creating original interactive works from scratch is exactly
  the same as with problem 2, multiplied by ten. You need talent. You need
  writers who understand interactivity, hypertext, and feedback loops. You need
  developers who think in terms of
  <a href="http://www.theoryoffun.com/grammar/gdc2005.htm"
    >game-like mechanics</a
  >
  and play-testing. You need people and you need them skilled and with
  experience.
</p>

<p>
  There aren&#8217;t that many of them around, so they&#8217;re relatively easy
  to find. They are also, for the most part, gainfully employed.
</p>

<p>Or they&#8217;re academics, which I guess counts as employed.</p>

<p>
  The biggest problem here is that nobody really knows how to pull this off.
  Games come the closest, but there&#8217;s no science there that can solve our
  problems. This is an art, pure and simple, and an immature one at that.
</p>

<p>
  With good developer tools and documentation, it&#8217;ll take years of
  experimentation before original interactive ebooks become an industry of their
  own.
</p>

<p>Without tools and documentation? Well…</p>

<h3 id="readers">Readers</h3>

<p>
  Let&#8217;s be honest here. As readers, we never asked for interactivity in
  our books, and the interactivity we need we won&#8217;t get, because both
  ereader vendors and publishers view us as cattle to be herded, locked up, and
  milked until we die.
</p>

<p>
  Publishers&#8217; attitudes towards readers are roughly analogous to that of a
  tax collector to a tax payer. It has escaped them that they aren&#8217;t as
  inevitable as death or taxes—that they operate in a free market, competing
  with other forms of entertainment and other, more easy-going, publishers.
</p>

<p>
  Ereader vendors, on the other hand, operate under the assumption that
  competition is constant, never-ending, brutal, and ruthless, and will apply
  whatever method they can think of to grab and maintain advantage.
</p>

<p>
  They may not state it plainly but it&#8217;s clear from their behaviour that
  features that could even remotely diminish platform lock-in aren&#8217;t
  likely to be implemented.
</p>

<p>
  Which is a pity, because most of the features that readers need are features
  that might be seen to compromise lock-in. They would all increase platform
  <em>loyalty</em> but decrease lock-in.
</p>

<p>
  For example, the single most valuable – productivity boosting – feature that
  an ereader platform could add would be a complete and open API for bookmarks,
  highlights, and notes.
</p>

<p>
  If I could have all of my highlights and notes automatically sync – marked up
  and tagged – to my <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">Simplenote</a> account,
  that would trump any design feature or widget ereader vendors can possibly
  think of.
</p>

<p>
  Reading is a big part of the writing process,
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book">always has been</a>.
  It&#8217;s been the one part of writing that computers haven&#8217;t helped
  improve so far. Ereader platforms have the chance to make <em>history</em> by
  integrating their reading tools with existing writing tools
</p>

<p>
  Imagine every Kindle highlight or note automatically appearing in
  <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine all of your Kobo notes and highlights syncing to Simplenote and from
  there, as if by magic, into
  <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>,
  <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">Scrivener</a>, or
  <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Imagine all of your iBooks data, your scribbles, bookmarks, highlights,
  available through a simple API call to all of your iOS writing apps. (Only
  with permission, of course.)
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://simplenoteapp.com/">All</a>
  <a href="http://evernote.com/">of</a>
  <a href="http://notational.net/">these</a>
  <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">amazing</a>
  <a href="http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php">applications</a>
  have revolutionised the art and craft of writing, but their reach is limited
  to what we can put into them. The one transformative feature that ereader
  platforms can add that isn&#8217;t reliant on developers, publishers, or file
  formats, is open access to reader&#8217;s annotations (highlights and notes).
