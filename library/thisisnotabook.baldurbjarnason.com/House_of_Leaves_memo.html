<div class="e-content EntryContent EntryContent--page">
<p><em>I met Mark Z Danielewski in 2014. He’s charming, fiercely intelligent
and a writer whose work I admire, even if I don’t always find a
connection to it. In 2001, he published his first novel (although it was
published by Pantheon Books, the extent to which Danielewski was
involved in the design and production of the book clarifies his
imprimatur), <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves, to which this short memo is directed</em>.</p>

<p>Dear HoL. Dear Editors. Dear Johnny, Zampano and Will. Dear Pelafina.</p>

<p>It is periodically suggested, proposed even, that <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves will
be published as a digital text. An eBook of some sort. Almost certainly
enhanced (about which more, later) and supplemented in some manner to
offer value to the digitally-enabled reader, whose attention will
otherwise slip away from pages bearing a facsimile of print to their
social media feeds, their Facebooks and their Twitters, to their
surroundings that cannot possibly be an armchair, or a sofa, because if
digital surely frees us from anything, it is the abject misery of
reading somewhere comfortable and safe, somewhere with tea, or strong
coffee and a single light behind our heads, throwing shadows onto the
page.</p>

<p><span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves (you’ll excuse me referring to you in the first person?)
is book as artefact. It attends to the idea of the book as Citizen Kane
does to film, or Welles’ War of the Worlds to radio drama. It embodies
something unsayable, although I shall certainly attempt to say it here,
and in doing so, renders itself perfectly unadaptable into any other
medium. The thing about unsayable things though, is that they can say
thing about what is not possible, by means of what is.</p>

<p>The limitations of e-text, as we currently encounter it, are those of
process, and of related form. The eBook is a reproduction of the printed
book; in that it arises from the same word-processed source, sometimes
rendered through a page-layout software, sometimes not, but regardless;
text unaltered from that which will be set, printed and bound. It is
tied to the physicality of the book by a tangled skein of commercial
opportunity and myopia. For most texts, regardless of their content,
this is not an unideal scenario. A best-selling thriller, the motion of
which is forward, always forward into the unknown and the solving of a
case, or reconciling a body, is served well by an eBook edition. The
clumsy rendition of page-turning on an eReader is a scant inconvenience
to bear. For a book designer, the sudden replacement of typographic
choices is galling, but not necessarily about to induce a fainting
spell. Books, for the most part, are adaptable things. The form has
survived for so long in part because of that adaptability, rather than
in spite of it. Even the Kindle’s facility for increasing typesize,
offering a readable text without recourse to magnifying lenses or
powerful microscopes, doesn’t dent the book’s permanence, even in a
digital form.</p>

<p>Then there is <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves.</p>

<p>On the one hand, there is the sheer physicality of the book. I do not
refer to its heft, or the shape and size of the object itself. Rather
the manner in which it demands to be read. Buried inside those pages is
a reminder of the potential every airport paperback has forgotten, or
had lobotomised. The book is a thing, a thing to be turned and handled
with care. That we have to shift the book around in our hands to read it
is just one thing that will collapse under an iPad’s auto-rotation
‘feature’. We will be denied something fundamental to the book’s
content, unless we cripple some small, minor, but inherent function of
the digital. Unless the construction of the digital edition attends to
this; makes it a feature of the reading experience just as the footnotes
and pacing are a feature of the print original. Then, of course, it’s an
app, not a book, because eBook file formats cannot accommodate textual
play without rendering every page as an image file. Every single page.
But is that important?</p>

<p>Paper is thin, and words require our full attention lest we miss
something.</p>

<p>The first question that ought to be asked before attempting a
transposition<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="House_of_Leaves_memo.html#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> of <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves, is ‘what is the book?’</p>

<p>The book is unease. It is the paranoia that sets in when you are sure
there is something else in the <span class="houseblue">house</span> with you. It is invasion (I
treasure the examination of the Uncanny that <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves contains.
The origins of the term are accompanied and surrounded by an example—as if in situ—of the affect) and it is dread. That it is contained
within 705 sequential pages only highlights this. A book offers escape,
a place in which we can imagine and explore another life, another world.
The escape offered by <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves is not safe, or comforting. It
crawls under the skin and it’s trickery, the slippage between reality
and fiction within those pages, is anything but a welcome escape. The
formal qualities of its design, too, implicate this. Our relationship
with a written text is comfortingly linear, is based on a knowledge that
the book is limited by endpapers and cover, that it has been brought
down somehow and confined. A book should not escape those pages and
infect our imagination, demand to be held up to a mirror and deciphered.
It should not be the subject of discussion forums as to what exactly is
going on in there.</p>

<p>All of those things are possible, as this “book” (of which this
memo is an excerpt) makes clear. They are possible, though, because
those extra-textual elements have been designed into the work. They
should not be possible within the conventions of a novel.</p>

<p>But here we are, and there they are, and now the question is: What might
a digital edition of <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves attempt to do with that?</p>

<p>Let us be clear. Were <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves to be directly adapted into a new
form, with every footnote, typographic trick, intertextual referent,
typeface and layout completely intact then it will have failed. The
nature of the book - as a book - is part of the power of the story. We
don’t read it so much as it allows us to glimpse something inside its
pages. We make sense of what we can, and we search for the rest.</p>

<p>A transposition of <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves has to start somewhere, though, and
in the absence of the author, I offer this:</p>

<p>I have a folder on my laptop. It is called <em>‘House Of Leaves Exploration #4’</em>. Honestly, I do not know where it came from, other than the sure knowledge that I downloaded it as a torrent file, and that this would have been sometime in the last 3 years (the age of this machine). The folder contains music files. A few I recognise from Poe’s Haunted, the rest comprise readings from the book. Mark’s voice is clearly identifiable, the rest are not. Female, male, old, young, American, Spanish. In English, in German. I had to Google it to find out what it is. In 2000, Mark Z Danielewski and Poe recorded an album’s worth of experiments, using House of Leaves as the template (template isn’t the right word, but it says something about the relationship of the book to these tracks). It isn’t available commercially, as far as I can determine.</p>

<p>Which is a shame. It is raw, and fragmentary. It seems unfinished
somehow, but nothing can deny the power of hearing voices read the text.
Reading them in your ears, through headphones that cancel every other
noise in the room. If <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves is suggestively claustrophobic,
this targets the amygdala directly.</p>

<hr />

<p>A digital edition of <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves might draw on that album, it might
use sound to inform the layers of story. It might be something we
haven’t seen yet. It should not, I believe, be the same object that
exists in all of those print editions, in colours and with strikeout
text. Those have an audience, and they’re very happy with their story
(and I’ve seen the sales figures—for a book that’s 15 years old this
year, it’s still shifting very nicely thank you). The digital <span class="houseblue">House</span> is
different, can be different. It can transpose what lurks at the heart of
the <span class="houseblue">House</span> and make the uncanny new.</p>

<p>A suggestion as to where to begin:</p>

<p>A book is a confined space. It has covers, endpapers and signatures sewn
inside. <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves does things with those affordances, of course
(always in service of the idea that the book is the <span class="houseblue">House</span>), but it never
rejects the formal qualities of the book. A digital <span class="houseblue">House</span> of Leaves has
no such affordances. It can <strong>be</strong> Navidson’s <span class="houseblue">house</span>. Confined at the
beginning, maybe only the a portion of the text is visible (Zampano’s
notes, for example, as Johnny finds them), expanding as it is read, as
the <span class="houseblue">House</span> itself opens up. Remember too, that it can lie. A file that
says it is 97 pages long might only <em>be</em> 97 pages long until it is read.
Then it can start sprouting extra sections, commentaries and typography
as much as it likes.</p>

<p>Digital is nothing if not dishonest.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading. Now, back to the book.</p>
