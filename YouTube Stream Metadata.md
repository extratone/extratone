On `2015-10-21 04:47:23 UTC`, we launched our little independent media company *starting with* its Discord server, which makes it... Old as fuck, basically.

This evening, we would VERY much like it if you'd stop by `DRAKESVILLE` - Ye Eldest Video Channel - and shoot the shit with us: https://discord.gg/0b9KQUKP85AyJ9Yo?event=900841469642965022

Our primary goals are mostly reminiscent, but for those not at all invested in Extratone but perhaps *just* now getting around to the level of GENIUS, EARLY ADOPTER-AS-FUCK-TYPE THINKING we were, six years ago, might want to know what we've learned, as your definitive elders in Discord usership. 

WE MAY OR MAY NOT **KILL THE FUCKING SERVER, LIVE**.
