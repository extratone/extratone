    <title>Fediverse Futures implementer usergroup</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/fediverse-futures-implementer-usergroup/671</link>
    <description>At [today&#39;s SocialCG](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/2020-05-09-socialcg-meeting/639) meeting, we talked about doing a &quot;future of the fediverse&quot; usergroup that meets maybe every other week or once a month or so.  It would take place over video and be like the following:

* An implementer gives a half hour presentation on some topic: what they&#39;re working on, an idea on where things should go, etc.
* Then the next half hour is fellow implementers discussing details of making that happen.

Note that this is different than the SocialCG, which has a broader range and is less implementation-details-oriented sometimes.  This group would specifically, specifically, be about implementation details.

Who is interested?  We need to pick a time and select a video chat URI.  Then we should start talking about &quot;first topics&quot;!

A few of us unofficially did something like this recently and it went well; I talked about a roadmap for the fediverse... there were only three of us, and we thought it was such a good format we should do it more often.  If nobody else has a &quot;first topic&quot;, maybe I could do a repeat of that for those who missed it.  But I&#39;m open to other first topics too!

Bit first I should ask: who is interested and would want to attend?</description>

            <p>Yes please! This is more relevant to my interests than SocialCG as I really prefer to talk about specifics.</p>

            <p>Sounds great <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/raising_hand_man.png?v=9" title=":raising_hand_man:" class="emoji" alt=":raising_hand_man:"><br>
A good first topic might be an overview of current implementations, not necessarily of apps but rather of what activity/object types and fields (incl. extensions) have been implemented and how they’re used, and discussing an approach to documenting that to help current and future implementers be more interoperable.</p>
