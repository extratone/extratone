    <title>Place to discuss general issues of interop between implementations?</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/place-to-discuss-general-issues-of-interop-between-implementations/362</link>
    <description>Hi all, is there a place to discuss general Fediverse interoperability on the application layer? Not on a spec level but for topics like &quot;let&#39;s brainstorm how various AP-compatible servers could interpret an Article object type and render it for their users&quot; or discussing general principles of interoperability.

I could imagine a sub-category for interoperability under Software, but maybe somewhere else would make sense?</description>

            <p>Thanks for the mention. I am not sure I understand how the tag system is suppose to work here. What category are posts about <a class="hashtag" href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/tags/interop">#<span>interop</span></a> suppose to posted in? Lets say I want to work out interoperability between polls posted from Misskey showing up on Hubzilla. Where would this posted?</p>

            <p>hi darius! A similar topic is <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/content-text-plain-and-fallback-behaviors-for-limited-clients/340/2" class="inline-onebox">Content, text/plain, and fallback behaviors for limited clients</a>, which is focused on rich text support specifically.</p>
<p>In general, I think concerns of interoperability are always a concern for the community group. Even if it’s not a discussion about hard requirements, things like codifying best practices, hashing out general principles, and coming to consensus on guides to implementation are definitely things the process can help with. Overall, I’d recommend using the <a class="hashtag" href="/c/5-activitypub">#<span>activitypub</span></a> topic—<a class="hashtag" href="/c/14-software">#<span>software</span></a> is designed to be focused on <em>specific</em> implementations.</p>
