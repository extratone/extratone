    <title>Welcome to SocialHub</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/welcome-to-socialhub/7</link>
    <description>SocialHub.ActivityPub.Rocks hosts ActivityPub free software developers and enthusiasts to study and share knowledge, specify functionality together, steer the course of ActivityPub W3C Recommendation through code, conversation, consistency, cooperation...

We welcome both technical and non-technical discussion. Non-technical discussion should focus on cooperation across, between, and beyond projects; governance of the commons; ethics and aesthetics; etc.

_Is it your first time using Discourse? Try sending a message to @discobot._
 
Each category has a pinned topic (tagged with #about)  which explains the expected norms and limits of the category. This facilitates keeping discussion on topic. Don&#39;t worry about _drifting_ though: we can always move topics and posts around if needed. Let the conversation be respectful and reproductive!

You can get started with the #welcome topics to get an bird&#39;s eye view and feeling about how to engage with this community. Other tags of interest for starters: #faq, #about.

<p>OK am starting to feel like am trolling “Reimagine the Internet” as its all academic and <a href="https://activism.openworlds.info/tags/dotcons" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">#dotcons</a> history.</p>
<p>The same people and the same story we have heard for the last wasted 10 years.</p>
<p>Nothing so far touching on the <a href="https://activism.openworlds.info/tags/Fediverse" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">#Fediverse</a> let alone the <a href="https://activism.openworlds.info/tags/openweb" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">#openweb</a>.</p>
<p>It’s off TOPIC I feel like shouting though out the oneway ZOOM video presentation - you can find their video’s on youtube.  After proding they are talking about putting them on <a href="https://activism.openworlds.info/tags/peertube" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">#peertube</a> <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"></p>

            <p>Welcome to the SocialHub!</p>
<p>In the last month you joined the ActivityPub community forum, so you might be overwhelmed by all the conversations sprouting around, and it’s normal.  The <a class="hashtag" href="/tag/welcome">#<span>welcome</span></a> and <a class="hashtag" href="/tag/about">#<span>about</span></a> tags might come handy.</p>
<p>You can use the notification system to avoid having to dive in topics that might not interest you: click the <code>notifications</code> word below for details.</p>
<details>
<summary>
notifications</summary>
<p>in each category and topic, you can see a bell icon that, once clicked, will reveal a notification menu:</p>
<p><img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/uploads/default/original/2X/1/17a1d1236114927165cdaeb561a653c1d83e322d.png" alt="image" data-base62-sha1="3n3FJ7vX8GONv7bQA287touVv3v" width="484" height="338"></p>
<p>If you cannot <em>see</em>, the user interface will be different, maybe keyboard shortcuts will be more useful:<br>
typing <code>m</code> while the focus in on the page (not in the composer) will interact with topic notifications, you must type another letter to mute a topic (<code>m</code> again), track a topic (<code>t</code>), or watch a topic (<code>w</code>) ; <code>r</code> will reset the notification for this topic to normal, i.e., you will only receive notifications if you are <code>@mentioned</code> by name. When you participate in a topic, you automatically <code>watch</code> it, when you read it, you automatically <code>track</code> it.</p>

</details>
<p>If you’re affiliated with a free <a class="hashtag" href="/c/software/14">#<span>software</span></a> team, please chime in <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/about-the-software-category/27/1" class="inline-onebox">About the Software category</a> topic so we can setup <a href="/g">groups</a> and a dedicated category for your team!</p>
<p>If you’re not a technician, you might want to mute some topics to avoid information overload, and focus on participating in <a class="hashtag" href="/c/fediversity/10">#<span>fediversity</span></a>. Policy-makers might be interested in participating to <a class="hashtag" href="/c/meeting/fediverse-policy/59">#<span>meeting:fediverse-policy</span></a>.</p>
