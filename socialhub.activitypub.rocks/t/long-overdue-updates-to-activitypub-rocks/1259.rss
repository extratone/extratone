    <title>Long overdue updates to activitypub.rocks</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/long-overdue-updates-to-activitypub-rocks/1259</link>
    <description>Well what can I say, it&#39;s kind of embarrassing it&#39;s taken so long, but [activitypub.rocks has been updated](https://activitypub.rocks/news/overdue-site-updates.html) with long-requested (and long-overdue) changes... *especially* trying to recognize resources put forward by this very community.

Hopefully we&#39;ll do better going forward.  Anyway, there you go!</description>
