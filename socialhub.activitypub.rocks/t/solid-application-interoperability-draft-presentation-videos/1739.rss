    <title>Solid Application Interoperability Draft - Presentation videos</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/solid-application-interoperability-draft-presentation-videos/1739</link>
    <description>Justin Bingham of Inrupt and admin of Solid forum recently posted some info on the draft specification for **Solid Application Interoperability**.

As I understand, seamless interoperability and data portability is one of the key advantages/promises of Solid. However, I have the impression that the effort put into making it a reality is not proportional to it’s importance.

Hi @ludwigschubi - there’s actually considerable effort put forth in this area. I’d encourage you to look over the work underway in the [data interoperability panel ](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/), in particular the [draft specification on application interoperability ](https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/).

We recently did some live presentations that were recorded (note that each are 90 minutes long - but they cover the vast majority of the draft spec):

* [Application Interoperability Walkthrough - Part 1 ](https://solid-interop-public.s3.amazonaws.com/application-interoperability-walkthrough-part-1.mp4)
* [Application Interoperability Walkthrough - Part 2 ](https://solid-interop-public.s3.amazonaws.com/application-interoperability-walkthrough-part-2.mp4)

If this is a topic you’re interested in - you’d be most welcome at the weekly [panel session ](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/#meetings).

They represent Solid&#39;s perspective on interoperability. Summarising from [problems &amp; goals](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/c20059fcde16c084c991c2618b3290b6a725ea1f/problems-and-goals.md) for this specification:

1 - Seamless data interoperability across disparate applications
2- Use intuitive data boundaries to provide human to machine interoperability
3 - Secure collaboration over intuitive data boundaries
4 - Standard and flexible organizing model for data
5 - Flexibility and support for different and evolving query mechanisms
6 - Optimize and extend, but do not change Solid fundamentals</description>
