    <title>Hello from hospitality exchange community devs!</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/hello-from-hospitality-exchange-community-devs/1764</link>
    <description>Hi all, I am happy to be joining you!

I am a software engineer (backend java) and a long distance bike tourer. 

I was a contributor to the community built WarmShowers Android app (50+K installs in app store) when the 30 years old organization connecting bicycle touring travelers and those who want to host them, over the period of 5 years slowly changed from fully open and transparent, volunteers built platform and apps to a payed service that locked its own community (160K members) behind paywall. 

We published a message from the developers: [https://WarmShowers.bike](http://warmshowers.bike/) (where you can also find a short background story) and started to think about building next generation federated platform as a long term remedy for the issues bicycle touring and other hospitality exchange communities faced in recent years (CouchSurfing did similar thing). 

I&#39;d like to discuss the idea more and possibly get some help in the direction where to go next. 

---
Edit: I moved the idea to separate discussion: https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/hospitality-exchange-community-considers-moving-to-the-fediverse/1765</description>

            <p>For federated hospex JavaScript seems most natural choice, as most of the existing platforms are built with it, but for the other apps that I had in mind, there is quite some chance that I’d go with jvm and Java/Kotlin, and if so I was thinking about giving a try to Quarkus, which also leverages vert.x. Keep me in the loop if you were doing anything in that area.</p>

            <p>Yeah, Java is having a great ecosystem still. I wanted to start federated app dev based on Java too, running on top of <a href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>.</p>

            <p>Oh, I’d like to add your project(s) to the <a href="https://git.feneas.org/feneas/fediverse/-/wikis/watchlist-for-activitypub-apps">ActivityPub Application Watchlist</a> as soon as they are underway (there’s no need to have any working code, just the intention to build federated apps is enough for inclusion). The watchlist is a staging area for later inclusion in <a href="https://fediverse.party">Fediverse Party</a>.</p>
<p>Could you have a look at the list and tell me if and how you want to be listed there?</p>

<p>I am sure it does! It’s known as Conway’s low, that structure of a system designed by an organization tends to be isomorphic with that organization structure.
