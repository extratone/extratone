    <description>Hi,
I&#39;m not sure if you already know this, but European Project have the chance to get funded up to 40 000 €. https://culturalfoundation.eu/initiatives/culture-of-solidarity-fund

They seek for project that fits one of the following three descriptions:
* Cross-border media collaborations that address societal issues across Europe that have become more imminent as a direct or indirect consequence of the pandemic.
* Development of digital tools that are based on shared public values and that have the potential to contribute to a digital European public infrastructure .
* Storytelling for increased public attention and policy awareness regarding the needs and opportunities for open and democratic European digital and other media spaces.
And I think this smells a lot like fediversity!

Deadline of CfP: 31st March 2021

I hope this doesn&#39;t count as spam?</description>
