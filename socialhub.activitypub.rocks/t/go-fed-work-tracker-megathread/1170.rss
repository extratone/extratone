    <title>Go-Fed Work Tracker Megathread</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/go-fed-work-tracker-megathread/1170</link>
    <description>*All work funding sourced from the [Go-Fed ActivityPub Labs OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/go-fed-activitypub-labs). The budget is split between* Unbudgeted Work, *whose funding comes from a general shared pool, and* Budgeted Work *which requires some preparatory conversations before the work can be addressed, to ensure it has some baseline of dedicated funds to, hopefully, get done.*

*@cjs currently reimburses his time to be zero-cost to the OpenCollective.*

-------

**Work Available**
---------------

Below is the list of available work that needs doing. Assignees are listed afterwards in (parentheses).

**Wish List**
----
*(Would be **Budgeted**, but lacking allocation of funds)*

- Write [NGI0 Discovery](https://nlnet.nl/propose/) grant proposals:
  - For ActivityPub [testsuite](https://github.com/go-fed/testsuite) completion
  - For engineering of an OCAP-based transport/routing protocol based off of [eris](https://github.com/cjslep/eris) and [scr](https://github.com/cjslep/scr)
- Redesign of the [library](https://github.com/go-fed/library) to better accommodate a web-view of FEPs as they go through the process. 
- Getting missing FEPs that are needed to better-document current conventions. Note that new FEPs are generally not incentivized, this is an exception to get what should be documented today, done. They are [identified canonically here](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/come-help-list-of-feps-needed/1097) but duplicated below:
