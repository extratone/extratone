    <title>Creating AP subcats for Actors, Activities and Objects?</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/creating-ap-subcats-for-actors-activities-and-objects/699</link>
    <description>I just created a topic https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/offers-unchained/697 for discussions on the `Offer` activity type and its implementation. Elsewhere there is discussion on supporting `Group` in various topics.

Would it be an idea to create specific subcats - besides only C2S and S2S - for the most relevant AP Actors, Activities and Objects that need further elaboration, so as to keep the discussion on these more central and easy to find?</description>
