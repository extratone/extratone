    <description>A place to discuss the packaging and distribution of federated applications for the purposes of making self-hosting more accessible.

We want to discuss how to help make it easier for all technically curious people to deploy federated applications on their self-hosted homebrew servers or VPSes.

This means creating a space for developers, users and packagers to meet and discuss. We invite projects like [YunoHost](https://yunohost.org/#/), [Freedom bone](https://freedombone.net/) and [Freedom box](https://freedombox.org/) as well as other similar projects to participate.</description>
