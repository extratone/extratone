**Dr. Ian Brown** (CyberBRICS Visiting Professor, Fundação Getulio Vargas in Rio de Janeiro) elaborated on his research which explores interoperability as a tool for competition and regulation. Various judicial and civic entities (e.g. European Commission, US Congress members, lawyers, economists, and civil society organisations) have looked at how to use interoperability as a way to improve competition among gatekeeping platforms (i.e. social media, IM applications, and search engines). At the same time, civil society groups also advocate for interoperability as a way for citizens to have better control over their media environment, as they would then have the ability to choose different providers to cater to their needs.

**Derek Caelin** is an Innovation and Data Specialist at Counterpart International (CPI) with experience in open source technology and social media. He has helped activists deploy technology for social good at CPI, PeaceTech Lab, and the United States Institute of Peace.
