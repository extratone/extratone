    <title>Hello from a community software dev</title>

    <description>Hello!

I am joining this forum to participate in the hospex topic --&gt; https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/hospitality-exchange-community-considers-moving-to-the-fediverse/1765/5

I&#39;ll write more about that in there, but first a bit of self-indulgent writing about myself :grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes: 

I switched from &quot;commodity developer&quot; to &quot;community developer&quot; about 5 years ago, via https://foodsharing.de, https://trustroots.org, https://social.coop (co-op mastodon instance), and https://karrot.world (my current &quot;main&quot; project) - basically low/no-funded grassroots community projects that have (mostly boring) tech as a key piece of infrastructure, but where the _real activity_ probably takes place offline, facilitated by the platform.

I started pretty naïvely  wanting to &quot;scoop up&quot; and organise fragments of professionals volunteer time,  wondering what the limitation is on these projects are that prevent them being as slick as uber/airbnb/etc. 

Following the rabbit down the hole, I&#39;ve come to see the much broader challenge as one of reconnecting a whole load of parts that have become disconnected, not so much into a coherent whole, but as a vibrant ecosystem. And I really mean _broader_ - so, reconnecting love, spirituality, family, friends, self, compassion, activism, economics, the infinite, science ... into something where all these parts support the others ([something like this](https://nicksellen.co.uk/images/ecosystems.small.jpg)).

Much of this even leads me away from tech, as I&#39;ve struggled to find a way to engage that acknowledges this broader context. Decentering &quot;tech&quot; has become important to me, even though it&#39;s my main skill. I would have been delighted to just code away building cool shit if all this other stuff had been considered! Alas...

Anyway that&#39;s enough about me.</description>
