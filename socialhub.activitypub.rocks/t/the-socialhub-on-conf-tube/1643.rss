    <title>The SocialHub on Conf.Tube</title>
    <link>https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/the-socialhub-on-conf-tube/1643</link>
    <description>From the beginning, we adopted http://conf.tube to disseminate videos related to the ActivityPub community. The [APconf account](https://conf.tube/accounts/apconf/video-channels) was created for the #meeting:apconf2020 and remains there to give witness to the work accomplished.

Yesterday I obtained from [@rgggn](https://floss.social/@rgggn), the admin of conf.tube a dedicated [socialhub](https://conf.tube/accounts/socialhub) account for the ActivityPub community at large. I would like here to propose how we could use this account collectively, notably to avoid further hiccups with timely access to the _publish_ button.

Here are a few topics we can discuss here...

## What is the socialhub account for?
_This section is to define what goes to the video channels_

Description: https://conf.tube/accounts/socialhub/about

&gt; The [SocialHub](https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/) brings together members of the W3 Social CG, ActivityPub implementors, users, researchers, and other interested people to further the development of the specifications and explore the Fediverse together.
&gt;
&gt; This account provides channels to share ongoing work with the community. For the ActivityPub Conference, see the [APConf](https://conf.tube/apconf) account.


## Access to the socialhub account on conf.tube
_How to hit this publish button_

As for other SocialHub assets, the @sysadmin.team shares credentials to access the account. 

- should we define another team to share credentials with?
- should we define some dedicated channels?
  2 initial channels come to mind:
  - ActivityPub for Administrations (our current webinars/workshop series)  
  - APconf 2021 if we want to do that
- should we define a following policy?

For all questions my guts feeling is that we should trust our community members and respond to requests here. When questions arise, we can discuss the specific cases.</description>
