            <p>This historical topic conserves the original discussion about the <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/policy-socialhub-community-values/1391" class="inline-onebox">SocialHub Community Values Policy</a>.</p>
<h3>Proposal stage</h3>
<p>Since this is a <a class="mention-group" href="/groups/staff">@staff</a> proposal, the policy <s>will</s> enter<ins>ed</ins> into force <del>after a week</del> <ins>on</ins> (<span data-date="2021-02-19" class="discourse-local-date" data-timezone="Europe/Brussels" data-email-preview="2021-02-18T23:00:00Z UTC">2021-02-18T23:00:00Z</span>), to leave a bit of time for debate, in the hope to clarify any ambiguous point that may appear. All members of this forum will have to take action (either agree or disagree) to stop the daily flood of reminders.</p>

            <h2>Be CareFOO!</h2>
<p>Happy to introduce the “Care FOO” policy! Please take the time to read it thoroughly.</p>
<hr>
<div class="policy" data-group="trust_level_1" data-version="1" data-reminder="weekly" data-accept="I agree to abide by these values" data-revoke="I disagree and will go elsewhere">
<h1>We Care For Our Own</h1>
<p>Members of the Social Web Incubator CG agree to abide by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/">W3C Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.</p>
<p>On top of this, we acknowledge that Web and communication technologies are inherently political and can be used to cause harm, against the intent of the original creators. We recognise power imbalances already endemic in the tech industry, and in Social Web systems in mainstream use. With that in mind, we do not welcome participation (however polite) by contributors to projects which are designed or primarily used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>oppression, or encouraging oppression, of vulnerable people or minority groups.</li>
<li>planning, encouragement of or inciting violence against vulnerable people.</li>
<li>promoting fascism, nazism or other authoritarian systems and practices.</li>
<li>perpetuating, promoting, or enacting systematic injustices, such as racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are vigilant for the use of imagery, language and dogwhistles related to such behaviours. We reserve the right to exclude projects which tolerate such behaviours within their communities, or have not made a good faith effort to discourage such behaviours.</p>
<p>The intent of this policy is <em>not</em> to exclude wholesale any developers involved with projects or communities who unknowingly interact with bad actors, or who are struggling to or unable to eliminate behavior that goes against this policy in their wider communities. Similarly, we do not expect developers of open source projects to be responsible for every installation or fork of their codebase and will of course take the realities of this into account when making any moderation decisions.</p>
<p>SocialCG chairs and forum administrators may use their discretion to remove posts or suspend user accounts. SocialCG chairs may similarly refuse access to or remove individuals from virtual meetings.</p>
</div>
<h3>Active stage</h3>
<p>The policy is now active, from <span data-date="2021-02-19" class="discourse-local-date" data-timezone="Europe/Brussels" data-email-preview="2021-02-18T23:00:00Z UTC">2021-02-18T23:00:00Z</span>.</p>

Policy Details</summary>
<h2>Details</h2>
<h3>It does concern you!</h3>
<p>Following <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/policy-proposal-socialhub-community-values/1453">intense discussion during the proposal phase</a> <a class="mention" href="/u/rhiaro">@rhiaro</a> updated the Policy to make it clear we are not trying to place unreasonable burdens on developers or other participants in open source communities who can’t be held responsible for actions of wider communities or other users of their projects.</p>
<p>The policy above is destined to anyone willing to become a member of the SocialHub community, and applied here to <a class="mention-group" href="/groups/trust_level_1">@trust_level_1</a> – a group you’re automatically part of when you spend a few minutes reading around…</p>
<h3>Here’s how it plays…</h3>
<p>Once you’re in this group, you will receive a <em>weekly</em> reminder until you accept or refuse the policy.</p>
<p>You can simply click the “I agree to abide by these rules” button to accept the policy. If you want to refuse the policy, you first have to click the same button, and then the “I disagree and will go elsewhere” button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Accounts with no policy agreement or with disagreement will be suspended indefinitely.</li>
<li>Accounts who do not abide by these rules will be removed as well.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<h3>Proposal stage</h3>
<p>The proposal stage got some intense discussion which is now archived at <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/policy-proposal-socialhub-community-values/1453">https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/policy-proposal-socialhub-community-values/1453</a>.</p>

            <p>Sometimes you need to reach out to someone else, anyone, for advice or support. You may do so in the dedicated <a class="hashtag" href="/c/community/well-being/9">#<span>community:well-being</span></a> category. This category is only available to members (users with <a href="https://blog.discourse.org/2018/06/understanding-discourse-trust-levels/">trust level</a> 2 or higher), and you may post anonymously there.</p>
<p>Please see <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/welcome-to-socialhub/7/1" class="inline-onebox">Welcome to SocialHub</a> for alternatives to posting anonymously if you need support.</p>
<p>When replying to this topic and any topic under the <a class="hashtag" href="/c/community/well-being/9">#<span>community:well-being</span></a> category, you should take extra care for using inclusive, welcoming language, and avoid impulsive reaction – even more so than anywhere else on this forum. You are bound to community norms for civilized discourse and a decent attitude towards yourself and others.</p>
<p>If you cannot see the Well-Being category, that means you did not participate enough in this community to reach the required trust level. If you think this is an error, please contact <a class="mention-group" href="/groups/staff">@staff</a>. You can see who’s staff on the <a href="/about">about page</a>.</p>

          <title>How to Use the Anonymous Post Feature?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[how]]></dc:creator>
          <category>SocialHub Policy</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Discourse provide a feature to “post anonymously” on the forum. This topic explains how it works, and how to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Before posting anonymously, you should have read this!</strong></p>
<h2>What is meant by “anonymous”?</h2>
<p>Discourse has a functionality that allows you to <em>enter anonymous mode</em>. A new account is created each time you enter this mode, so that administrators and moderators cannot determine who is posting.</p>
<p>But remember that <strong>this is not strong anonymity</strong>: someone could determine who you are by analyzing who is online at this time and by other means.</p>
<h2>Why post “anonymously”?</h2>
<p>Anonymous mode is enabled so that everyone can convey messages related to support issues, e.g., when you need to reach out for any reason (problem with an admin, another person, or simply you are burnout and need some support).</p>
<p>Anonymous mode does not allow you to ignore the rules and norms of this community: abuse will result in removing this functionality and a permanent ban if you’re caught.</p>
<h2>Where to post “anonymously”?</h2>
<p>Please do not abuse this functionality: we’ve prepared a dedicated space in <a class="hashtag" href="/c/community/well-being/9">#<span>community:well-being</span></a> for venting out and reaching out for help. Please use this space and avoid posting anonymously where you’re expected to be identified. See <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/community-well-being/17/1" class="inline-onebox">Community Well-Being</a>.</p>
<h2>How to Enter Anonymous Mode?</h2>
<p>Click your avatar, your username, then scroll down to “Enter anonymous mode”.</p>
<p><img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/uploads/default/original/1X/c54e4874ce7193a9b828a08e33445b2912519dd2.png" alt="anonymous-mode" data-base62-sha1="s9rMvaoLrXVGsFJxyBX3XkxCccq" width="339" height="293"></p>
<p>Note that you will need to logout and login again to “leave” anonymous mode.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Members of the ActivityPub SocialHub community practice collective governance and co-construct shared policies to reflect common norms.</p>
<p>Each topic matches a given policy that is proposed, debated and eventually adopted or rejected.</p>
<p>Only <span class="mention">@staff</span> can start a policy topic. If you’re interested in proposing one, please open a new topic under <a class="hashtag" href="/c/2-community">#<span>community</span></a>.</p>
<h2>Using the Policy Feature</h2>
<p>The policy feature is available to <span class="mention">@staff</span> members and can be set with a special markup:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-nohighlight">[policy group=staff reminder=daily]
We strive to be excellent to each other.
[/policy]
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the policy applies to members of the <span class="mention">@staff</span> group, who are reminded every day – nagged – to adopt it. In order to propose a policy for everyone, the <code>trust_level_0</code> group can be used.</p>
<p>For more detailed information about this feature, you can see the <a href="https://meta.discourse.org/t/discourse-policy/88557" rel="nofollow noopener">discourse-policy topic on Meta</a>.</p>
<p>And for good measure…</p>
