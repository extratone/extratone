          <title>Using ActivityPub for Podcast Comments (exploration)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[keunes]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Dear ActivityPub community!</p>
<p>I’m somewhat active in the Podcasting 2.0 community. This community works on the <strong>Podcast Namespace</strong>, which extends the RSS standard with new tags for podcasts. For example the <code>podcast:person</code> tag (to identify individuals heard in the podcast, both presenters and guests), or the <code>podcast:funding</code> tag (to indicate ways to financially support the podcaster). Podcast hosts should support them; podcast apps should use them.</p>
<p>The loose group is now also discussing <strong>comments</strong> (via a <code>podcast:comments</code> tag), and one venue that is being explored is ActivityPub.</p>
<p>The goal here is a YouTube-comment-like-experience. But then in some decentralised fashion. I see some open questions regarding</p>
<ul>
<li>hosting (where are the comments hosted; by podcast host, podcaster, podcast client app, or another specialised comment entity)</li>
<li>moderation (should probably be the responsibility of the podcaster, but this depends on who hosts the comments)</li>
<li>inclusion (should comments be gathered through a hashtag of some sorts, or is there a single thread that is displayed)</li>
<li>initiation (who gets to ‘start’ a comment thread, and who has control over this (client app, podcaster, no-one))</li>
<li>technology (should we rely on Mastodon, or create a ‘new’ ActivityPub-based standard specific to comments? If something new, in which ways should it federate?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Adam &amp; Dave (who basically initiated the Podcasting 2.0 community) are discussing  the comments concept here - I would recommend listening to it because it probably gives a better idea than my summary above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://podcastindex.org/podcast/920666" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Podcasting 2.0</a>: Episode 44: Separating the Nodes from the Noobs<br>
<a href="https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/PC20-44-2021-07-02-Final.mp3#t=5617" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/PC20-44-2021-07-02-Final.mp3#t=5617</a> [01:33:37]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It would be great if the ActivityPub community could chip in.</strong> Every 1,5 week or so there’s a community developer meeting, and the first next one is Wednesday 7 July at 20:00 CEST. I’m pretty sure that Podcast Comments will be on the agenda for that meeting.</p>

1) We plan on using ActivityPub for comments.  This already exists and works.  That's ActivityPub (Mastodon style).  Just taking time to get to help with implementation details, we're catching up on other things.
2) I'm like you, Adam,...</p>

          <title>How to Empower Local Communities/Organizations with Fediverse applications?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dorian]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Fediverse Futures</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Lately I’ve been thinking about how I might be able to propose some fediverse applications to some local organizations in my area in order to enhance and replace (in that order) their organization efforts on the large closed social media platforms. I think working with already existing groups tied to geographic areas could bring some great grassroots power to the fediverse.</p>
<p>Something that I think is really important in approaching this is that communities themselves know best what they need. I know that if I come in just talking about the ways in which Mastodon mimics or is better than Twitter people will just ignore me. As they should, if I come in speaking before listening.</p>
<p>Has anyone else worked with local groups on these things? What were some pitfalls? Benefits?</p>
<p>Two pros of fediverse social media that I’ve been mulling over, both related to moderation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising based social media means that when participating in your group members get served ads that you have no control over. I’ve heard stories from some People of Color that they got served racist ads, ads that they felt were targeted to do harm. That’s a problem fediverse social media can solve.</li>
<li>Fediverse social media has many more options for moderation. On Facebook many groups are set to private in order to protect members. This closes them off, less able to communicate with other groups. Federation enables groups to be selectively closed to some groups and open to others.</li>
</ul>

          <title>A system allowing existing user to vouch for new invitees</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[lrhodes]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Fediverse Futures</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I mentioned this <strong>feature idea</strong> over <a href="https://merveilles.town/@lrhodes/106495932606975203" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">on Mastodon</a>, and a few people suggested I suggest it here as well: Some sort of semantic relation between accounts, built into an instance’s invitation and/or registration function, indicating that the newer account was admitted at the request of the older.</p>
<p>You can think of it as a profile-based system for recording when one user <em>vouched for</em> adding another. On the one hand, this would add a slightly different way of mapping the semantic relationships between accounts, on top of the follows, which are more gregarious. The vouched-for/by linkage between accounts would imply some measure of trust and entail some measure of responsibility. As such, fostering those relations could encourage community-building.</p>
<p>That’s somewhat aspirational, though. The more immediate practical effect is that baking vouched-for/by relationships into profiles would give moderators a tool for working through mediation procedures.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you moderate an invite-only instance. An active member  — call her Helga — DMs you and asks, “Hey, can my pal Ogbar get an invite?” Sure thing. You go into the mod panel to generate the invite. One of the options is a checkbox labelled “Vouched by…” or something to that effect. Checking that activates a text field/drop down. From that, you select Helga’s account name. Now, when Ogbar uses the invite link, the account he creates will be permanently linked to Helga’s account in a semantic relationship that’s visible to moderators.</p>
<p>Weeks pass. One day, Ogbar does something that requires moderation. A glance at his account would tell you who requested their invite. So rather than jumping straight to a ban or some other heavy-handed measure, you can ask Helga to mediate. You may not even need to ask — maybe just knowing that that act of having vouched for Ogbar is baked into their accounts encourages Helga to feel just a little responsible for Ogbar’s behavior, and she steps in of her own volition.</p>
<p>But let’s say that things don’t work out that way. Helga never steps in and is unresponsive to friendly requests for mediation. Ogbar’s behavior worsens, and eventually you feel compelled to ban him. Then, a year later, Helga DMs you and asks,  “Hey, can my pal Ryuchi get an invite?” The Ogbar episode is no longer fresh in your mind, so you look at her profile for a refresher. Oh, right… Maybe her vouching for a prospective user shouldn’t count for so much, huh? Informed, you can better weigh how to handle her request — whether that means turning it down flat, basing your decision on some other factor (like Ryuchi’s social media history elsewhere), or warning Helga that banning another user she vouched for will mean tighter restrictions on her account in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some implementation questions that need to be worked out (e.g. would these relations be public, or visible only to the moderators and the accounts linked by vouching?), but I think it’s an idea worth exploring.</p>

          <title>Gitea/Codeberg roadmap to federation</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dachary]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>I’m curious to hear what people involved in Codeberg ( <a href="https://codeberg.org/6543" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">6543 - Codeberg.org</a>  <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/eyes.png?v=9" title=":eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":eyes:"> ) have in mind regarding federation. Will there be multiple independent instances of Codeberg working together in a federated way? Is it something that is worked on in Gitea (via <a class="mention" href="/u/cjs">@cjs</a> <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/14186" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">go-fed integration</a> maybe ?). Or something else entirely?</p>
<p>I’ve not seen recent activity on this topic but since I’m not involved in the Gitea/Codeberg community, it is entirely possible that I missed something <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>You  <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/sparkling_heart.png?v=9" title=":sparkling_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":sparkling_heart:">  love Fediverse, right? It’s vibrant unique culture and the lovely people you meet. You want to protect it, increase its beauty, see more applications interoperate seamlessly. You know that you are part of a ‘reimagining of social networking’ that is much needed, as traditional social media are destroying the fabric of society.</p>
<p>What you may not know is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Fediverse is still incredibly weak. That it has a tiny community of technologists that evolve it, and that this process is stalling as people are absorbed in their own projects. (“The Tragedy of the Grassroots Movement?”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That what Fediverse currently offers is just the tiny tip of the iceberg. That humongous potential still lies dormant, waiting to be explored. That we can go <em>way</em> beyond microblogging features that dominate the fedi now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That YOU are instrumental in tapping this potential, and that you don’t have to be a techie to help with that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks">SocialHub community</a> we come together to improve the Fediverse, evolve its standards and the ecosystem. And regardless of your skills and expertise we need all the help we can get to move forwards, to progress this thing we love.</p>
<p>Throw off your individualism and become a fedi builder. It’s a win-win for all. We are ‘United in Diversity’ and should build together. Join SocialHub as member and interact. And also join <a href="https://lemmy.ml/c/fediversefutures">Fediverse Futures on Lemmy</a> to brainstorm on exciting ideas.</p>

<p>Note that a Host (taking the example of WS) does not <em>need</em> to provide Accomodation. They may also provide help in any form (e.g. amenities), such as offering repair for flat tires, dry shelter when it rains, just the shower/drinking water, breakfast or dinner, etc.</p>

          <title>Bulding information sources with lasting value</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[VictorVenema]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Fediverse Futures</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Mastodon is a huge step-up from Twitter. The Signal to Noise Ratio is much better. With all this valuable information flowing by and so many people investing a lot of time into creating quality content, I increasingly wonder whether we could use that energy to jointly build knowledge bases.</p>
<p>A second starting point of my thinking is the Delightful List (on Open Science) I am creating with <a class="mention" href="/u/aschrijver">@aschrijver</a> on Codeberg. (This is similar to the Awesome Lists on GitHub).  And I am also compiling a list of all groups that work on digital things in my city, which I thought to publish on a local Wiki. Hopefully this local lists will be followed by other topics (housing, environment, sports, …) happening in my city, so I was thinking of Wiki (rather than a GIT repository) to make it less technical to add and edit it for normal people.</p>
<p>Then I just listened to a talk at the Open Repositories conference. In de end I am not sure they actually did this, but initially it sounded like the system they were building would suggest interesting datasets to researchers using their repositories. Suggesting potentially interesting articles, datasets and code would be very useful for science. Currently you have to wade through a lot to find the few things that you need.</p>
<p>Before writing this up, I remembered that Mastodon nowadays has bookmarks. So the step to social bookmarking is no longer that big.</p>
<p>Putting all of this together. Would it be possible to create a system where you bookmark interesting toots, posts and webpages (either in Mastodon or your browser), which are stored by default in a bulk list. My browser bookmark menu is extensive. That would be the next step: categorizing the bookmarks.</p>
<p>Some of these categories could be public. Some could be jointly edited with friends. Some could be based on hashtags (probably best moderated before becoming publicly visible). Once a category is sufficiently filled a machine learning tool could also suggest interesting toots and posts (again probably best moderated before becoming public) from the toots and RSS feeds you missed.</p>
<p>Some of these collections could also take into account how current the information is. If the curator would estimate how long a toot or post remains relevant, the system could sort the collection by how (relatively) timely the links are (or, e.g., replace the announcement of the 2021 conference with a link to the conference series).</p>
<p>Above such a collection people could write a short summary on the topic. This could be done like a Wikipage (as long as all links go to pre-approved URLs from the link collection, spam risks are small and everyone (not just the group making the collection) could join in writing/editing such a text).</p>
<p>Just a thought. How could we improve this idea? What existing systems already do something (somewhat) similar?</p>

          <title>FedeProxy found funding. How do we ensure project success?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dachary]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>As of this month I’m <a href="https://forum.fedeproxy.eu/t/dapsi-call-deadline-20-01-2021/14" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">lucky to be funded</a> to work on fedeproxy, for the next 9 months. Lucky because I can’t shake the notion that the luck factor (15 projects out of 170) is the primary cause of the selection. And the first question in my mind is <strong>how to make use of this time to bootstrap something sustainable</strong>?  It’s a tough one and as far as I can tell the vast majority of projects did not succeed in doing this. One thing is for certain: unless something is done differently and cleverly, the probability that fedeproxy momentum fades in 2022 is extremely high.</p>
<p>So the question is… what is your advice for someone in my position? What should I do?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, the relationship between <a href="https://solidproject.org/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Solid</a> and <a href="https://inrupt.com/products/enterprise-solid-server" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Inrupt Enterprise Solid Server</a> is similar to GitLab CE and the proprietary GitLab server. That is, the main driving force behind both are the same people but their goals are conflicting. The community attracted to the Free Software version have motivations that can (and certainly are) different from the motivations of the Inrupt company which (that’s the definition of a company) is about making money.</p>
<p>That kind of conflict of interest is something I’m watching closely when and if I choose to use a Free Software. In the case of GitLab, for instance, I decided to take the risk that the commercial interests of the company driving GitLab will eventually make it difficult, if not impossible, for me to use the Free Software version. My discomfort grew over the years (a number of essential features are implemented but not published as Free Sofware, such as mirroring a repository) and I’m happy about the prospect of moving to Gitea which does not seem to have such a strong conflict of interest.</p>
<p>In the case of Solid, my choice was even simpler since, to my knowledge, there is no ready-to-use Free Software implementation anyway. But since Solid was mentioned a few times in the context of this forum, I’m sure people have a different opinion on the matter and I would love to hear about it <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

<p>As I understand, seamless interoperability and data portability is one of the key advantages/promises of Solid. However, I have the impression that the effort put into making it a reality is not proportional to it’s importance.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>Hi <span class="mention">@ludwigschubi</span> - there’s actually considerable effort put forth in this area. I’d encourage you to look over the work underway in the <a href="https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/">data interoperability panel </a>, in particular the <a href="https://solid.github.io/data-interoperability-panel/specification/">draft specification on application interoperability </a>.</p>
<p>We recently did some live presentations that were recorded (note that each are 90 minutes long - but they cover the vast majority of the draft spec):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://solid-interop-public.s3.amazonaws.com/application-interoperability-walkthrough-part-1.mp4">Application Interoperability Walkthrough - Part 1 </a></li>
<li><a href="https://solid-interop-public.s3.amazonaws.com/application-interoperability-walkthrough-part-2.mp4">Application Interoperability Walkthrough - Part 2 </a></li>
</ul>
<p>If this is a topic you’re interested in - you’d be most welcome at the weekly <a href="https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/#meetings">panel session </a>.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>They represent Solid’s perspective on interoperability. Summarising from <a href="https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel/blob/c20059fcde16c084c991c2618b3290b6a725ea1f/problems-and-goals.md">problems &amp; goals</a> for this specification:</p>
<p>1 - Seamless data interoperability across disparate applications<br>
2- Use intuitive data boundaries to provide human to machine interoperability<br>
3 - Secure collaboration over intuitive data boundaries<br>
4 - Standard and flexible organizing model for data<br>
5 - Flexibility and support for different and evolving query mechanisms<br>
6 - Optimize and extend, but do not change Solid fundamentals</p>

<p>This has got me thinking, if main stream social media continue to fail at dealing with abuse of people,  then it may present us a real opportunity to not only provide alternative platforms so that genuine fans can follow their favourite sports team / players but also an environment where users are more in control over this.</p>
<p>A team could set up an instance, and have all it’s players on that one instance,  another instance could be set up for a supporters club (which generally you pay to be part of ) so as part of that membership you can join the fediverse instance,  this would allow some communication between clubs and fans (a sort of membership perk)</p>
<p>Out side of this,   those who are not members can join the fediverse but have some sort of limited access, maybe connect but in follow only mode (not commenting for example)</p>
<p>I just wondered if the fediverse is ready for that, it may perhaps require</p>
<ol>
<li>Easy set up<br>
2 for clubs it may need an instance with say :-</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Mastodon,</li>
<li>Pixelfed</li>
<li>Peertube</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Single sign on for all 3 services<br>
4 2 factor authentication</li>
</ol>
<p>For fans we would need to get across the idea that you just need Mastodon and your instance can still follow the other services (a concept that may be harder to grasp at first</p>
<p>Finally,  I think Mobile first is expected so make sure there is a full range of apps, or perhaps an app that could handle all 3 services in some way.</p>
<p>I am not sure if this would solve the issue, but it may get more people on here if some of the big clubs took up the idea and abandoned centralised social media</p>
<p>Of course these clubs all have sponsors so the sponsors would probably need to join too, and also accept the model of ‘advertising’ that is different here.  So they need to adapt to our way of doing things, rather than the fediverse surrendering to money making and advertising.</p>
<p>Just an thought as a way to reach out and perhaps help solve a problem at the same time.</p>
<p>Of course the ‘skills’ needed to set these services up are not exactly out there in huge numbers,  so perhaps there is money to be made from people here, but perhaps with some of that revenue being channelled back in to development of the fediverse.</p>
<p>Perhaps also these services need to be based in the UK or EU to comply with data protection laws and a UK based instance.</p>
<p>This may encourage the decentralisation model giving users back control as the primary selling point</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Idea</strong> : Select business domains we’d love to see in the fediverse, and write visions / business cases for candidate projects.</p>
</blockquote>
</aside>
<p>There are two interesting cases I would be happy to <em>fediversize</em>, being currently discussed in a team I am part of.</p>
<ol>
<li>Secure handling of sensitive IoT data. The case is how to gather and securely process medical telemetry from smartwatches, fitness bands and such (implants being discreetly <em>undiscussed</em>).  Following the idea of decentralization, I can imagine a locally hosted server, collecting data, somehow combined with secure backbone (<a href="https://friendica.wprzemianie.pl/search?q=%23TheTubes" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">TePeWu: Friendica | Search</a>) and some ways to make data available either for an authorized physician or (locally anonymized) for research. But here I got to the limit of my technical imagination and I have no one around here to help me. Anyone?</li>
<li>There are two cases of matching underused assets with their possible uses<br>
2.1. Medical equipment being left unused once research projects are done and closed with professionals lacking funding to buy/rent it on a commercial basis.<br>
2.2. Clinical research programs looking for certain specific “cases” – volunteers for experimental treatment or diagnostics – and people who cannot afford therapy for their less common conditions.<br>
I can imagine using fediverse approach to create decentralized exchange, without central database, using tag and categories to find matching pairs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do you think it is worth some effort?</p>

<p>I’m not sure which Category to use for this post. Please move it as you see fit.</p>
<p>I’d like to share with you a small piece of software that helps to define node blocking and/or following (which is the case for Peertube) policies.</p>
<p>The idea behind this software is to avoid centralized white/black lists, and instead enable node admins to create their own policies based on the policies of other ‘likewise’ nodes.</p>

<p>“On mastodon.social / mastodon.online, newly registered users no longer automatically follow admins. End of an era. There’s something else now… will post about it later…”</p>
<p>New (public) Patreon post: Feature preview: Onboarding</p>

<p><strong>TEXT here</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>Feature preview: Onboarding</h2>
<p>Back when I was working with Pam Drouin on improving the UX on <a href="https://joinmastodon.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">joinmastodon.org</a> and we did user testing sessions, one of the (at the time) out of scope suggestions that came up was to give a new user some choice of accounts to follow. This came up again during the development of our iOS app as I saw an opportunity to try and address that. I have heard someone call it the “<a href="https://twitter.com/ShaanVP/status/1371972331095126019" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">interesting-ness problem</a>” - you must give a new user something interesting in the first few seconds on the app or they bounce.</p>
<p>This is a pretty difficult problem to solve. When a user is new, there is nothing in the system that could be used to find what would be interesting to them. Most recommendations are based on what the user previously interacted with (in fact, our existing follow recommendations system was exactly that, showing you who you interacted with most that you don’t follow yet). I’ve made some attempts to help the situation before, namely by making new users follow their server’s admins by default (a “Myspace Tom” kind of deal) pretty early on.</p>

<p>New users will now see this page on first launch of the web app. Obviously this is a screenshot from my development machine, so it’s just example data. Which brings me to: How did I decide to approach the interesting-ness problem.</p>
<p>In absence of other information to go on, I decided that the only reasonable approach is to use the wisdom of the crowd, or popularity. To minimize vectors for manipulation and ensure the presented content is actually fresh (no use recommending someone an account that’s been inactive for a long time, even if it has the most followers!), I chose to use only local data about accounts instead of relying on total follower numbers, and to consider only followers that themselves have been active in the past 30 days.</p>
<p>Looking at the results, I realized that “big name” accounts are not necessarily “interesting” accounts. Case in point the <a class="mention-group" href="/groups/mastodon">@Mastodon</a> account itself: A lot of followers, but only updates when a new version of Mastodon comes out, that’s hardly something a person would stick around for. So I had to turn to content itself, by seeing who wrote posts that got the most engagements in the past 30 days. If everyone shares around the post, it’s gotta be worth seeing, right? In the end I went with a mix of both, most-followed and most-engaged-with accounts.</p>
<p>The one piece of information that we do have about new users is their preferred language. Not everyone on Mastodon speaks English, so I felt it was important to try and help people find content in their own language. I added some code that determines which language an account posted in most recently, and classified accounts into those languages, allowing the follow recommendations to be specific to each language. Since not all languages are equally active on Mastodon, the language-agnostic recommendations are used as fallback.</p>
<p><strong>Now a bit of practical advice if you want your account to show up in those recommendations:</strong> Make sure that in your profile settings, you have opted-in to the “Suggest account to others” option (previously it was “List this account on the directory”). Your account will also not show up if your account is locked (“Require follow requests”). Since bios on Mastodon can get pretty wild and we’re working with limited space, the UI will display only one line of the bio and attempt to cut it to the first sentence only (to avoid mid-sentence cut-offs). So try to word your bio such that the first sentence describes you best.</p>
<p>Conversely, new users will no longer automatically follow admins. The admin setting that used to control this is still used though, now to push specific accounts to the top of recommendations (and it’s been renamed). There’s a new API endpoint (/api/v2/suggestions) that shows a bit more information about each account, specifically the source of the suggestion: “staff”, “past_interactions” or “global”. I’m in talks with another UX designer to run some user tests on this new flow.</p>

          <title>Fediverse, NetCommons and the blueprint for P2P society?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[pskulski]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Fediverse Futures</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I am new here, so I can only hope I put it into an adequate category. Please help me correct it, if I am wrong.</p>
<p>My background is more political (as in “personal is political” and vice-versa) than technical, although I keep my toes and fingers in many jars here and there.</p>
<p>For many years now I’ve been working to find a practical way to show people the benefits of P2P networked society, where “bubbles” are not underground bunkers, but rather “safe spaces” wherefrom people can venture outside to meet others.  To cut the long story short, I believe that if we combine the social dynamics inherent to Fediverse with community-controlled infrastructure and digital memory (think NetCommons) we can create a strong impulse towards building a society of confederated heterogeneous communities. Fediverse would then become a PoC for inert medium, encouraging cohabitation, communication, and cooperation between communities of all (within reason) shapes, sizes, and colours.</p>
<p>I am currently involved in some projects which include self-hosting made easy (Yunohost) and federated tools of communications. We are trying to increase community-level resilience and empowerment giving them better control over their data. If we are lucky enough, we may initiate an upward spiral, making local and intentional communities stronger and more fit to take their role of a social mainstay in the face of the All-crisis.</p>
<p>I would be happy to learn if this thinking resonates here.</p>

            <p>I want to propose an idea for a project that I want to implement, but I don’t know if it will be useful to anyone.</p>
<ul>
<li>It will be an engine for creating thematic websites, fansites, etc.</li>
<li>The main section will be a place where users can post their submissions (it will be possible to turn on pre-moderation or turn off ability to submit posts at all).</li>
<li>There will be ability to make multiple “sections” - for example first for user-submitted posts and discussions, second for site news, third for pictures gallery, etc.</li>
<li>You’ll be able to change the appearance of the sections - it can look like a forum, like a newsfeed (as in social networks), maybe something else.</li>
<li>The tech stack will be based on PHP/MySQL - i want it to be installable on any shared hosting.</li>
<li>The process of installation and configuration also will be simpler than in other fediverse projects.</li>
<li>It will be compatible and federating with other ActivityPub-based projects, at least with Mastodon.</li>
</ul>

<p>There’s some great feedback on the toot already, right? Loïc, you’ve got your audience right there on the fedi <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/blush.png?v=9" title=":blush:" class="emoji" alt=":blush:"><br>
Also we’ve got diversity in abundunce in fedi culture.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks">SocialHub</a> we just presented in our first <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/ec-ngi0-liaison-webinars-and-workshop-april-2021/1539">“ActivityPub for Administrations”</a> event the slogan and rallying cry  <strong>“Social Networking Reimagined”</strong>, and described fedi culture as <strong>“United in Diversity”</strong>.</p>
<p>These two things can be embraced by FedeProxy, and become deeply engrained in your approach. First of all for your own project development. Here you can…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dogfood your own development process that you’ll learn along the way, while dogfooding the fediverse.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And incorporate that in your ‘product experience’ i.e. as product features. I think your ‘proposition’ can be strongest the more you think about the Domain, and the less about the technical reality of what the software does (i.e. a bridge / proxy between code forges). In software development things all starts with <strong>culture and process</strong>.</p>
<p>I’ve worked with (scaled) agile in the past, as tech lead and product owner in quite large (200+ devs, 100+ consultants), quite diverse (60+ natiionalities) environment, where we adopted a <a href="https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/">Spotify Engineering Culture</a>. I have also seen during my whole tech career (which has been mostly FOSS, fedi, humanetech advocacy &amp; community volunteering for the past couple of years… not much ‘career’ in that. It’s all humble pie <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/wink.png?v=9" title=":wink:" class="emoji" alt=":wink:"> ) plenty of times where processes, culture and communication are the bottlenecks to successful projects. Not the tech itself.</p>
<p>Here can be the <strong>absolute strong points</strong> of FedeProxy, that might make it a killer app! By thinking holistically about what the objective is, and go from there:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Facilitating great, open to anyone, community-driven, successful free software projects that can sustain themselves.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now Spotify Engineering Culture is interesting. You can go for something similar, <strong>yet entirely different</strong> at the same time. Imagine if FedeProxy could deliver their own vision to open software development culture + processes with videos similar to these (look through the specifics, those are <em>unimportant</em>):</p>
<p>          <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/94950270" data-original-href="https://vimeo.com/94950270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" seamless="seamless" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-forms allow-popups allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox allow-presentation"></iframe>
</p>
<p>(and here’s <a href="https://vimeo.com/85490944">the video</a> of Part 1, more focused on Scrum / agile)</p>
<h2>
<a name="discover-the-domain-3" class="anchor" href="#discover-the-domain-3"></a>Discover the Domain</h2>
<p>Now, is it worthwhile to go the extra mile and explore the above? It will certainly consume part of your funding in extra time spent.</p>
<p>But what you have to do anyway is to analyse and elaborate the application / ‘business’ domain where you want to reach your project objectives. Right now, FedeProxy is conducting User Research. Very good and utterly important to gather as much feedback as possible.</p>
<p>But there’s a possible pitfall too. What users are you researching? For what domain? Currently on the forum this occurs in the <a href="https://forum.fedeproxy.eu/c/user-research/8">“UX / User research”</a> category. But UX is a step too far, if you do not know the domain. There’s a risk to start thinking about concrete features and functionality, UI widgets even, way too fast.</p>
<p>Note that there’s no need to search for a new paradigm - which I have named “United Software Development” - in a full deep-dive either. Just determine if it can be in your Vision! Then from there you can work backwards, find stuff that may be Roadmap items, skin further… until you drill-down to a MVP.</p>
<p>I feel that with a proper approach, FedeProxy may not be alone in chasing the paradigm. A host of other projects might spring up. This is the reason why I posted to <a class="hashtag" href="/c/fediversity/fediverse-futures/58">#<span>fediversity:fediverse-futures</span></a> instead of on the FedeProxy forum.</p>
<h2>
<a name="the-united-software-development-paradigm-4" class="anchor" href="#the-united-software-development-paradigm-4"></a>The “United Software Development” paradigm</h2>
<p>To conclude this brainstorm topic, I’ll try to come up with a first definition of the new paradigm that I feel tingling below the surface, just waiting to be uncovered…</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>United Software Development</h3>
<p><em>“Free, libre software development, processes and culture united,. Sustainable, open and accessible to anyone.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Open source software has eaten the world. Free software is still struggling. FOSS maintainers have a very hard time to manage their projects, let alone sustain their own life with a decent income.</p>
<p>United software development leverages the decentralized web, and combines all the best-practices and lessons-learned in the past decades to shape a way forwards. To facilitate a collective crafting of humane technology where people are in control, and that is to the benefit of humanity.</p>

          <title>Federating the Murmurations Protocol</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[aschrijver]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Fediverse Futures</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>(This topic is a follow-up to  <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/improvement-to-federation-md-convention-murmurations/1573" class="inline-onebox">Improvement to FEDERATION.md convention: Murmurations</a>)</p>
<hr>
<p>The Murmurations project itself is a good candidate to be a federated application. By adding S2S synchronization to the The Murmuration Index and everyone can set up their self-hosted instances within the Fediverse.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I notified Murmurations project about the federation idea: <a href="https://github.com/MurmurationsNetwork/MurmurationsServices/issues/128">Federated Murmurations with ActivityPub</a>.</p>
<p>Welcome to the SocialHub <a class="mention" href="/u/olisb">@olisb</a>, so nice to see you here.</p>
<p>This <a class="hashtag" href="/c/fediversity/fediverse-futures/58">#<span>fediversity:fediverse-futures</span></a> is mostly an ideation area, where we think about cool ways to further Fediverse-related technology, and tap ActivityPub’s full potential.</p>
<p>But going further with FEDERATION.md in the way described here, would first of all require interest from the ActivityPub application developers, and that takes time. In the meantime it may be very interesting to discuss Federated Murmurations in more detail.</p>
<p>Note that I brought up Murmurations on some other locations too, also merely brainstorming:</p>
<ul>
<li>At FedeProxy in <a href="https://forum.fedeproxy.eu/t/inspirations-from-other-communities/105/2" class="inline-onebox">Inspirations from other communities - Development - Fedeproxy</a>
</li>
<li>On Lemmy (a federated Reddit alternative) to a <a href="https://lemmy.ml/post/60740/comment/49719">Federated App Store idea</a>
</li>
<li>In my own ideas list for <a href="https://codeberg.org/innercircles/seedvault/issues/12">Auto-collecting awesome / delightful lists</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note too that regarding federation the Murmurations Library also should be part of what is federated, so every aggregator can collect those schema’s they are most interested in.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: <a class="mention" href="/u/olisb">@olisb</a> I have also brought Murmurations to attention of Yarmo, the <a href="https://keyoxide.org">Keyoxide</a> maintainer: <a href="https://codeberg.org/keyoxide/web/issues/88">https://codeberg.org/keyoxide/web/issues/88</a></p>
