Another issue is that gnunet can be a real resource hog. And the custom dispatcher based RPC protocol makes debugging a bit of a nightmare. And nobody’s heard of gnunet, so nobody participates in it, since everyone’s only posting about some shiny new badly done ReactJS thing.”</p>

          <title>ActivityPub Client-to-Server experiments</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[lain]]></dc:creator>
          <category>ActivityPub Conference 2020</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>In the AP C2S session we talked about the chicken-and-egg issue of having no clients for C2S because there are no servers and vice versa. During the hackathon we could try to write a C2S client and modify our C2S server parts in tandem to make it work, adding features that are missing at the moment.</p>
<p>One idea was to port an existing client (like pleroma-fe or similar) to the C2S API. This might be a bit too much.</p>
<p>We could also implement a basic chat client for Pleroma’s new ChatMessages that does nothing but handle chats, which could also give friendica the opportunity to get started with this feature.</p>
<p>If you’re interested in this, please post a comment.</p>

          <title>Short talk by Bob Mottram - Epicyon grew out of the need for a fediverse server on Freedombone - a self-hosting system</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[hamishcampbell]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Short talk by Bob Mottram</p>
<p>Epicyon grew out of the need for a fediverse server on Freedom one - a self-hosting system</p>
<p>Originally I had used gnu social, but as the fediverse grew this became less feasible. Gnu social had no moderation capability, so was easily swamped by trolls</p>
<p>Later I moved over to running pleroma on Freedom one. Pleroma was a significant improvement, but still had problems, and was hard to maintain</p>
<p>So eventually a couple of years ago it became clear that I either had to leave the fediverse or write a server suitable for self-hosting on ARM single board computers</p>
<p>And that was the start of Epicyon</p>
<p>Since ActivityPub has an email-like structure of inbox and outbox I decided to implement it like an email server. That meant no database, just saving posts to files in directories</p>
<p>I also wanted it to be easy to maintain with the minimum number of dependencies, and capable of use with a screen reader for accessibility</p>
<p>Interpreting the ActivityPub spec was not easy, and many of the things essential to make it work - like the encryption signatures - were undocumented</p>
<p>So implementing was like being a detective looking for clues</p>
<p>Another thing I wanted was customisability. In corporate social media sites are extremely dull and monotonous</p>
<p>Same old bland layout and generic colors. To some extent the fediverse had copied this. But it didn’t have to be that way</p>
<p>I also wanted to support Tor and i2p domains, so that in the most hostile environments it would still be possible to set up social networks</p>
<p>There is now a script for deploying Epicyon on i2p</p>
<p>One thing I’ve left out so far is the mastodon API, so Epicyon is mainly web interface only</p>
<p>Instead I’m following the route of making a Progressive Web App</p>
<p>In future I may try to support WebAuth for two factors, but for now the simple login is good enough. I’ve avoided OAuth because it looked complicated and I didn’t like its clunky UX</p>
<p>Epicyon is the first web app of any significant size that I’ve written. In Freedombone I’ve avoided inventing any new apps unless there really is no alternative.</p>
<p>It’s written in Python 3 with a html5 and CSS user interface. There is no JavaScript, so it is usable in Tor browser or Privacy Browser with JavaScript turned off.</p>
<p>I think the theme ability may be an important factor to draw people into the fediverse. It’s something which the silo systems can’t or won’t deliver. This means you can customize your instance to express your personality.</p>

          <title>Spritely at the hackathon</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[cwebber]]></dc:creator>
          <category>ActivityPub Conference 2020</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I’m trying to decide what to work on at the hackathon.  I’m also interested if others are interested in learning Spritely fundamentals and helping them over the week, if there’s interest.</p>
<p>As for me, I think the most interesting and immediately useful thing would be the Mandy layer of Spritely, since that’s the most ActivityPub relevant: <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/#mandy" rel="nofollow noopener">https://spritelyproject.org/#mandy</a></p>
<p>I have lots of ideas of things to work on though; I’ve also been very interested in the serialization layer, Aurie, since that’s what I’ve been most recently reading papers on and thus am itching to implement: <a href="https://spritelyproject.org/#aurie" rel="nofollow noopener">https://spritelyproject.org/#aurie</a></p>
<p>Also, I guess I could either hack on Terminal Phase (my space shooter game thing) because that would be a nice “break”, and it does use Spritely Goblins, but it might not be as useful as an “APConf” style contribution.</p>
<p>If others are interested in learning Spritely stuff over the course of this hackathon, maybe weigh in… maybe we can talk ahead of time.  One thing you can already do is go through the Goblins tutorial: <a href="https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html" rel="nofollow noopener">https://docs.racket-lang.org/goblins/index.html</a></p>
<p>But I would also be happy to help people learn.  Thoughts?</p>

<p><a class="mention" href="/u/schmittlauch">@schmittlauch</a>@toot.matereal.eu here. I am working on a completely decentralised topic and hashtag federation for the Fediverse. Currently I haven’t implemented any ActivityPub specifics though as building the foundational DHT is keeping me busy.<br>
So I am interested on how other approaches try doing something similar.<br>
Also grateful for Haskell-specific stuff.</p>

(I was also Thomas Thurman, once upon a time.) I’ve been active in the fediverse for a while, and before that on identi.ca. (I’ve been using birdsite since 2007.)</p>
<p>I started <a href="https://kepi.org.uk">kepi</a>, a Django/Python microblogging server, and I’ve been working on it for about eighteen months.</p>
<p>I’ve been coding most of my life. About five years ago my partner became very ill and I gave up my job to look after him. That’s still what I do day to day.</p>
<p>And, yeah, I write stuff. I used to be primary maintainer of Metacity, the standard window manager of GNOME 2. I was on the implementation team for the Nokia N900 for about two years prior to its launch. Other interesting things include a zcode→Javascript JIT compiler named Gnusto, which was later taken over and renamed Parchment; a LiveJournal tool called Joule which was surprisingly popular; a 1993 adventure game called Avalot; and Yarrow, a late-90s web interface to the GROGGS RGTP forum server at Cambridge. (That last one wasn’t very famous, but it was a great learning experience.)</p>
<p>And I started the campaign to get Alan Turing on UK banknotes!</p>

(My current goal is to have an Events tab in the Mastodon UI with a little calendar containing every Event a user has RSVP’ed to in the affirmative or is invited to, to start with.) I’ve built a bunch of other ActivityPub software too… I should probably create a landing page for that on my website…</p>

<p>folksonomy and categories – bottom up/top down – open/closed</p>
<p>Each has advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p>Can we be creative and bridge this divide</p>
<p>The OMN and indymedia reboot are both grassroots bottom up projects, so we obviously start with a folksonomy.</p>
<p>Recognising the is some use for categories a draft proposal.</p>
<p>We only have 5 functions <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slightly_smiling_face.png?v=9" title=":slightly_smiling_face:" class="emoji" alt=":slightly_smiling_face:"></p>
<p>Allow instances to put folksonomy items into category groups, these can be added as extra folksonomy  tags into the flow.</p>
<p>Allow instances to subscribe to this category groups as a flow (basic tool of OMN)</p>

Group members. How are those represented? Are they the followers collection? Can a group have followers at all? Or should it be a separate, custom collection a-la Mastodon’s pinned toots?

Since it’s a collection of actors anyway, can groups be members of groups? This feels weird to think about…

          <title>Getting extensions into the ActivityStreams 2.0 namespace</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[rhiaro]]></dc:creator>
          <category>ActivityPub Conference 2020</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There have been multiple attempts at a process for getting well-used extensions into the <a href="https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams" rel="nofollow noopener">official ActivityStreams 2.0 namespace</a> - doing so helps with discoverability and interop, as people can use each others extension terms, rather than reinventing things over and over. But none of the processes proposed could get consensus, and so nothing has been formalised.</p>
<p>I’m invested in this because <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/defining-alsoknownas/907">there is a property used by mastodon that the DID WG also want to use that we need to see in the namespace</a>, but also because it’d be nice if extensions work properly for everyone.</p>
<p>A lightweight process could be something like:</p>
<ol>
<li>Two or more implementations are sharing a term (either a property or activity/object type), and using it in the same way.</li>
<li>An agreed definition is written up in some sort of authoritative document - another W3C spec, a CG report, or something else stable and persistent (and ideally versioned).</li>
<li>A PR is made to the AS2 namespace to add the link and JSON-LD context definition.</li>
<li>The SocialCG convenes a meeting to agree to merge the PR, or if there are changes that would improve the status of the extension so it can be merged, or if there is some reason to definitely not merge it (eg. it is offensive, deliberately misleading, violates someone else’s copyright, the definition really doesn’t make sense, etc).</li>
</ol>

  <blockquote>
    The S2S specification doesn’t appear to have an API for discovering what capabilities an Actor’s server supports. As an example, I happen to know that right now Mastodon doesn’t support AP features such as relationships, so I shouldn’t offer my users an option to use those features with actors running on Mastodon. If I did, the experience for my user would be confusing (“I sent Bob an Offer activity (friend request), but Bob never responded,” when Mastodon never presented Bob with the activity). …

            <p><a href="https://gitlab.com/marnanel/kepi/" rel="nofollow noopener">kepi</a> is a Mastodon-alike server written in Django, currently pre-alpha and running on <a href="https://marnanel.org/users/marnanel" rel="nofollow noopener">one live test site</a> (with no current HTML interface). It supports ActivityPub for server-to-server communications; the client-to-server interface is provided by the Mastodon protocol.</p>
<p>During this hackathon session, we will discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>users’ hopes for this project</li>
<li>what needs to be done to achieve them</li>
<li>packaging to make kepi more easily testable</li>
</ul>
<p>If all goes well, we should come out of the session with a roadmap to v1.0. If all goes excellently, we should also have some working installation code and documentation.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome to participate, especially documentors, those who code in Django and other Python frameworks, and admins who might want to use kepi.</p>
<p>(Over the weekend, I’ll upload some documentation about the current structure of kepi, and link it here.)</p>

<p>(kepi was briefly known as chapeau; gitlab is still slightly confused about the name change, so “chapeau” appears in the URL. If anyone knows how to stop that, please let me know!)</p>

<p>We plan to get a test activertypub news site online by the end of the week, if your not sure how it should work watch the video <a href="https://conf.tube/videos/watch/953de898-74dc-4665-95fb-313042f66cc6?start=" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">The reboot of the indymedia project - ConfTube</a></p>
<p><strong>Todo:</strong></p>

<li>
<p>Add or check emoji. Many are implemented, but it might not be very comprehensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figure out the workflow for incoming moderated posts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Artwork for themes. Backgrounds, banners, icon sets, fonts. Get as creative as you want. Instance appearance doesn’t retain users but it’s an initial “this might be interesting” sign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fix polls, which currently don’t work very well. How are polls supposed to work at the protocol level?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add or fix translations. Translate the website or the Gemini site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Testing with i2p. Are there any new bugs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change the way that events are displayed, also ideas for how rsvp should be implemented. Is there any consensus on this?</p>
</li>
</ul>

What is the OMN (Open Media Network): 
The project is to shift power to the producers and consumers of media. It’s about good UI and simple empowering #KISS tools to move content, by categorising it with a grassroots folksonomy. This simple approach is balanced by shared site level syntax for the …

            <p>Just curious if anyone is interested in one or more BoFs on: Spritely, virtual worlds, or ocaps on the fediverse.  Could be one or multiple.</p>
<p>There will of course already be the <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/spritely-and-federation-futures/932">Q&amp;A session about the Spritely talk</a> so maybe more is not needed.  Unsure.  But unsurprisingly I’m interested in conversations about all these.</p>
<p>What do people think?</p>

<p>SkoHub implements an approach to resource discovery in a federated environment that is based on subscription and push notification instead of crawling, indexing and search.<br>
To enable this, it combines ActivityPub with SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization Systems), a long-lived W3C standard for publishing classifications, thesauri and other controlled vocabularies on the web. The core idea is to make the terms of a Knowledge Organization Systems ActivityPub actors. Thus, people can follow topics and receive notifications about newly published resources via a topic-based channel. The initial SkoHub project has been carried out in 2019/20 by the hbz in cooperation with graphthinking GmbH.</p>

We will kickstart the Hackathon <strong>today, 12:00 UTC</strong> in the <a href="https://bbb.fosshost.org/b/mor-phk-9a0-6ey">Hallway Track Room</a><br>
and Everybody can participate.</p>
<p>Today is about <code>Announce</code> ideas and <code>Create</code> combs.<br>
Some ideas were already sketched here:<br>
<a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/tag/hackathon">https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/tag/hackathon</a></p>
<p>So, <strong>Monday</strong> is an exploration day where people kind of test out ideas and see what kind of things they are thinking that they like to work on.</p>
<p>On <strong>Tuesday</strong> we basically commit to ideas and everybody writes out what is their planning on doing. And if you do not have it by then and you still experiment as in terms of the general ideas it is obviously OK too.<br>
We find the combs and projects which matter to us and hack/design/write/play <strong>during the week …</strong><br>
The combs will schedule asynchronous meetings whenever it is best for them and can meet with other projects in the Hallway Track which is open during the week or via irc channel <a class="hashtag" href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/tag/apconf">#<span>apconf</span></a> freenode …<br>
We can split up in rooms where everybody can share their screens (tell a moderator), coordinate working on repositories and take shared notes.</p>
<p><strong>At the end of the week we come together.</strong><br>
On <strong>Sunday, 15:00 UTC</strong> we will have presentations in the <a href="https://bbb.fosshost.org/b/mor-phk-9a0-6ey">Hallway Track Room</a> , we specially mean some kinds of demos – so that everyone who is participating in the hackathon can show of what stuff they built during the week.<br>
And even if your thing fails during the week, actually thats just as good as if it succeeds widely.<br>
Because what happens often in a hackathon is when people explore interesting and experimental ideas its sometimes things come out the way you expect and something they don’t – and even hen dont thats a wonderful opportunity, its a lesson for everybody incl yourself.<br>
That is the general idea and structure.</p>

            <p><em>I’m Darius Kazemi (<a class="mention" href="/u/darius">@darius</a>)  <a href="https://friend.camp/@darius">@darius@friend.camp</a>, and I’m an independent researcher, programmer, and artist. I’m the maintainer of Hometown, a fork of Mastodon with community-enhancing features, and I added AcitvityPub support to the open source event organizing software Gathio. I was a Mozilla Open Web Fellow in 2018-2019</em></p>

<p>As creators of federated social software, we have a choice: we can compete with social media giants on their own terms, or we can play our own game, one that’s impossible for the giants to play in the first place. If we want to do the latter, we need to identify the fundamental assumptions that constrain the giants and ask ourselves what we can do when we throw those assumptions out entirely.</p>
<p>In this talk, I am going to try and inspire you to make things that would be literally impossible to make on the centralized web. I am going to talk about both the advantages and disadvantages of doing this kind of thing. Expect to hear concrete examples of software that already exists, and also examples of software that could conceivably exist in the very near future.</p>
