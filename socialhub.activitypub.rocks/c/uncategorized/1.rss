            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I’ve spent the last decade working on software and attempting to understand decentralization as a social phenomenon. I come to this community in search of understanding, opportunity and a desire to do something that matters.</p>
<p>My journey started a couple decades ago with the free software movement and the four freedoms. I learned then that my thinking is particularly oriented toward the user, or the person, and ultimately humanity. That led me to support lots of people with their computers and technology and later developing software since it scales so damn well.</p>
<p>After noticing the astronomical value users were creating for proprietary software developers, and seeing social networks as more of the same, I wondered how users could benefit from the value they were creating in the form of a user-owned social network. If it was going to happen, the system would need to handle money to pay for servers at least, and PayPal came to mind. It was at this time though that PayPal shut down Wikileaks. I went looking for other ways to send money online which could not be shutdown and found Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This took me on another important leg of the journey toward understanding decentralization, when it works, how it works, what are the tradeoffs, and how it can be fostered. Fast forward to today, I wish to spend my free time on something truly important and again I return to this orientation toward humanity.</p>
<p>Many of today’s problems have been developing for decades as corporate power grew consistently putting profits over people. It is my belief that the most effective tools for reasserting sovereignty in the future will come through open source software and decentralization which returns privacy and agency to the individual.</p>
<p>The last couple of weeks, I’ve been doing a deep dive on the fediverse, examining Mastodon and Diaspora code and the AP spec, thinking about how I can best help these and other federated free software platforms and networks.</p>
<p>I’m glad to be joining you all and looking forward to what we can all do together.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>David (<a class="mention" href="/u/weex">@weex</a> / <a class="mention" href="/u/weex">@weex</a>@mstdn.social)</p>

            <p>Hello!</p>
<p>I am joining this forum to participate in the hospex topic → <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/hospitality-exchange-community-considers-moving-to-the-fediverse/1765/5" class="inline-onebox">Hospitality exchange community considers moving to the fediverse ;) - #5 by mariha</a></p>
<p>I’ll write more about that in there, but first a bit of self-indulgent writing about myself <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes.png?v=9" title=":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":grinning_face_with_smiling_eyes:"></p>
<p>I switched from “commodity developer” to “community developer” about 5 years ago, via <a href="https://foodsharing.de" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://foodsharing.de</a>, <a href="https://trustroots.org" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://trustroots.org</a>, <a href="https://social.coop" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://social.coop</a> (co-op mastodon instance), and <a href="https://karrot.world" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://karrot.world</a> (my current “main” project) - basically low/no-funded grassroots community projects that have (mostly boring) tech as a key piece of infrastructure, but where the <em>real activity</em> probably takes place offline, facilitated by the platform.</p>
<p>I started pretty naïvely  wanting to “scoop up” and organise fragments of professionals volunteer time,  wondering what the limitation is on these projects are that prevent them being as slick as uber/airbnb/etc.</p>
<p>Following the rabbit down the hole, I’ve come to see the much broader challenge as one of reconnecting a whole load of parts that have become disconnected, not so much into a coherent whole, but as a vibrant ecosystem. And I really mean <em>broader</em> - so, reconnecting love, spirituality, family, friends, self, compassion, activism, economics, the infinite, science … into something where all these parts support the others (<a href="https://nicksellen.co.uk/images/ecosystems.small.jpg" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">something like this</a>).</p>
<p>Much of this even leads me away from tech, as I’ve struggled to find a way to engage that acknowledges this broader context. Decentering “tech” has become important to me, even though it’s my main skill. I would have been delighted to just code away building cool shit if all this other stuff had been considered! Alas…</p>
<p>Anyway that’s enough about me.</p>

            <p>Hi all, I am happy to be joining you!</p>
<p>I am a software engineer (backend java) and a long distance bike tourer.</p>
<p>I was a contributor to the community built WarmShowers Android app (50+K installs in app store) when the 30 years old organization connecting bicycle touring travelers and those who want to host them, over the period of 5 years slowly changed from fully open and transparent, volunteers built platform and apps to a payed service that locked its own community (160K members) behind paywall.</p>
<p>We published a message from the developers: <a href="http://warmshowers.bike/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://WarmShowers.bike</a> (where you can also find a short background story) and started to think about building next generation federated platform as a long term remedy for the issues bicycle touring and other hospitality exchange communities faced in recent years (CouchSurfing did similar thing).</p>
<p>I’d like to discuss the idea more and possibly get some help in the direction where to go next.</p>
<hr>
<p>Edit: I moved the idea to separate discussion: <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/hospitality-exchange-community-considers-moving-to-the-fediverse/1765" class="inline-onebox">Hospitality exchange community considers moving to the fediverse ;)</a></p>

            <p>Hi there, i try to post an activity to mastodon as described <a href="https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/06/how-to-implement-a-basic-activitypub-server/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">here</a><br>
But get a “401 Unauthorized from POST <a href="https://mastodon.social/inbox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://mastodon.social/inbox</a>”</p>
<p>I think there are problems with the signature, but have no idea. Does anybody have an idea, how i can test whats wrong (without setting up / debugging  a mastodon instance)</p>
<p>I’m using <a href="https://github.com/tomitribe/http-signatures-java" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - tomitribe/http-signatures-java: Java Client Library for HTTP Signatures</a></p>
<p>Thanks Fredy</p>

            <p>Hi everyone!</p>
<p>I thought it would be a good thing to come here and say “hi” since 2021 will be the year where I’ll be going more deeper in the ActivityPub space. <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>
<p>I have developed some tools around Mastodon API in the past, the most notable might be the multi-accounts focused client app <a href="https://nicolasconstant.github.io/sengi/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Sengi</a>.</p>
<p>Currently I’m developing a pet-project on ActivityPub to understand a bit more how all this is working. It’s just a stupid Twitter2ActivityPub relay. The code is awful but it’s functional, I have a <a href="https://beta.birdsite.live/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">live instance here</a> and the code is linked in the page (can’t post more than 2 links as a new user).<br>
I will refine and refactor the code during the following weeks so that I’ll have a healthy base to work from.</p>
<p>My aim is to develop some more ambitious and useful tools in the close future, since ActivityPub can support ideas I had since some years already. I will try to develop my vision first in the first half of 2021 and will work on it concretely just after.<br>
But one step at the time, for now I’m the stupid padawan here to make a lot of errors and hopefully to learn from it. <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/no_mouth.png?v=9" title=":no_mouth:" class="emoji" alt=":no_mouth:"></p>
<p>See you around!</p>

            <p>Hi! Nice to meet you all!</p>
<p>I’m titi, from the catañol (catalan &amp; spanish) sector of the Fediverse we called “nodes ibéricos” and some of us are setting <a href="https://fedi.cat/" rel="nofollow noopener">Fedi.cat</a> <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> I can communicate (with mistakes) in english and french too, but I’m not really comfortable with imperialistic languages… That’s why I’m learning esperanto, and I love it. <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/heart_eyes.png?v=9" title=":heart_eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":heart_eyes:"> It blows your mind (like the Fedi, hehe).</p>
<p>I opened my first account in 2014 (RIP somsants-net; RIP quitter-se) and I was really grateful for qvitter interface. Maybe that explains why I prefer Pleroma interface (and software). I’m non-technical at all but I like to care about free culture and specially our beautiful federated ecosystems as a <strong>glocal relationships</strong>. That’s why I prefer Darius-style (50-100 people per node) than Gargron-style (vertical scalation).</p>
<p>I love Inkscape and the Fedi so I started a little campaing called <a href="https://barcelona.social/notice/9yYb2id5G49hkANSwS" rel="nofollow noopener">“Katikornius”</a> to promote good practices (as reading CoC and be nice to each other). And <strong>I love to write and I dream about a book (and then a documentary) that explains the Fedi</strong> but I would need your help to shape it. Should I start a topic about it?</p>
<p>Move slow &amp; fix things! <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/tada.png?v=9" title=":tada:" class="emoji" alt=":tada:"></p>
<p>BTW, please, send me “free links”. I’m GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) alergic. Thank you in advance <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <title>Early feedback and presentation of &quot;a federated professional business network&quot;</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[berkes]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Uncategorized</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>We are working on, “a federated linkedin”. At least, that is how I describe it to those familiar with AP and “federation” etc. It can also be described as “an addressbook on steroids” or “a crm with social features”. Our pitch to users is far from complete.</p>
<p>I’m looking for some early stage feedback, thoughts and ideas. Please don’t hesitate to tell me our idea is dumb either: all feedback is valuable. This is also my introduction, so: Hello!<br>
We don’t have any code other than lots of ugly Proof of Concepts (most using Rails or Rust). We don’t have a name yet.</p>
<p>I’m not entirely sure if this is the correct forum, so please point me in the right direction or tell me off  if this is off-topic.</p>
<p>Contrary to the current LinkedIn, Mastodon, PixelFed, PeerTube and so on, our envisioned network is all about your profile. Not the content, images, videos or updates you share, but the (changes to) your profile, are central.</p>
<p>This brings some interesting challenges to the table. Especially with how to play well with other players on the fediverse. First, because we will be sending out a different type of “updates”: things like <code>@jane@example.com, type: ProfileUpdate, "changed email from jdoe@example.com into jane@example.org"</code>. Or <code>@jane@example.com, type: Position, title: "Database Engineer at BigTableCo"</code> etc. And second because we have some details that differ with how AP and/or the current implementations handle it.</p>
<p>More specific: we have three types of “things” that we want to federate:</p>
<ul>
<li>changes to profile pieces (add, update, delete)</li>
<li>annotations to profiles</li>
<li>relationships between profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>And we have a different take on privacy levels and a different way of handling “followers”.</p>
<p><strong>changes to your profile</strong><br>
Any time you change something (important) that change is distributed as an update. This allows</p>
<ul>
<li>other parties to change your profile/data in their local copy (e.g. it allows your addressbook to update the persons’ phone number)</li>
<li>the fediverse to display interesting updates about people being followed. (e.g. it allows mastodon to show that Jane has a new Job at FooBarCo to the followers of Jane).</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m very curious to how you think this would work, if at all. Especially the second case.</p>
<p><strong>Annotations</strong><br>
Each user can make annotations and add tags to any other profile. This  is our basic CRM functionality.<br>
The annotations and tags can be federated as entity too. <code>@jane@example.com: type: Note, for: @bob@example.org, content: "Bob turned out to be the perfect designer for our ProjectFoo"</code>.</p>
<p>In itself, standalone, this could be interesting to the fediverse. A tool where you can annotate, tag or otherwise organize the people you follow. Not?</p>
<p><strong>Relationships</strong><br>
Another interesting challenge and difference to most AP models, is the “follow” or “relationship”.</p>
<p>We envision relations as something rich and annotated. So not a simple <code>user&lt;-user</code> follow model, but a full entity: “Anne is [a teacher] of Bob [from 1-09-2019 to 01-02-2020]”, “Bob is [married to] Jane [from 01-01-2000 to present]” or “Bob [spoke to] Anne [at FooConf2012]”.</p>
<p>The way we currently see this fitting in AP is to make this also into a simple “follow” relation. And to distribute (Create, Update, Delete of) such a relation to the network as entity.</p>
<p>This allows all instances to maintain a network graph and it gives users full control over that network graph. The added metadata allows people to search in more meaningful relations. Most current networks simply have a “x follows y” or, in case of linkedin “Y is relation of Z” which has no weight at all: a colleague that you worked with for 20+ years bears the same weight as a relation that added yo because he picked up your businesscard on a conference. Which current networks like Linkedin then solve with “algorithms” or by asking (stealing) more data like gps-location data, from you.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy model</strong><br>
Another interesting challenge is the privacy model.</p>
<p>Both our envisioned business model (something for another time, another post) and the nature of the federated data needs to be well defined and easy to understand by users.</p>
<p>We currently envision a model where each “item” can be set to “public, private, local”. Where, contrary to the often used model in mastodon et al, there is no model to limit to your social graph (your followers only), but rather the instance your are on. An “item” is basically anything mentioned above from “a specific contact detail”, to “an annotation” to “relation”. You may want to share your phone number with your inner circle but not the world. You may leave an annotation that is fully private to you, or maybe you want to share it with the world. etc.</p>
<p>An important detail (often asked) is that, no, relationships are not reciprocal. Meaning that if <span class="mention">@jane</span>@example.com adds a relation “colleague of bob”, bob has, nor shows a relation “bob is colleague of jane”. Making it reciprocal would be unpredictable (other people can change the way you present yourself) would allow spamming and -most important- would be a feature that can be abused to bully. Only the user itself can change anything that makes up her profile.</p>
<p>We are in the early stages, so our exact focus (i.e. the most important features) are not solid yet. But we do know three things: We want it to be privacy-friendly, data-owned-by-users and self-hostable (therefore federated). A place where professionals can do “professional networking” without the recruiter-spam, privacy-issues and “being the product” that current professional networking has.</p>

            <p>If I’m reading the Client Addressing (§6.1) and Outbox Delivery (§7.1.1) correctly, it seems as though the specification is written such that every Activity having to do with an Object (e.g., <code>Like</code>, or <code>Document</code> sent <code>inReplyTo</code>) is addressed to the recipients of the original message plus any who have later sent an activity addressed to those recipients about said Object.</p>
<p>If that’s the case (and all servers/networks are working), then every Actor’s server should have received every Activity associated with the Object. And if <em>that’s</em> the case, then servers should be able to index those messages and provide collections of e.g., <code>/likes</code>, <code>/replies</code> without online access to the server where the message originated. It’s kind of like email where everyone is expected to use Reply All on every message, except obviously the parent.</p>
<p>Is that correct? If so, I have follow-on questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There seems to be a race condition. If a user U sends a public message A to their followers, and a user S not addressed in the original message (because they weren’t a follower) could <code>Like</code> object A but still be in the process of delivering A to all recipients (imagine U has thousands of followers). Before receiving S’s <code>Like</code>, another user T sends a <code>Create</code> activity containing a <code>Note</code> with A as the <code>inReplyTo</code>. T’s client will not include S as an addressee (since it doesn’t know about S’s <code>Like</code> yet).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the Followers collection changes, which followers should receive reactions to the original message? How are they addressed? Do S2S Activities contain the expansion of the Followers collection, or are they referenced by the collection ID (e.g., <code>https://example.com/bob/followers</code>?</p>
</li>
</ol>

          <title>Representing images</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[koehn]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Uncategorized</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I have C2S and S2S apps in development, and I’m working on a way to allow users to attach images to documents they send. The images will be stored in S3-compatible storage, so a URL will suffice to accessing them in AP. I’m planning on representing them using the Attachment structure. To help with performance and minimize bandwidth, I’d like to serve and show a preview of the images uploaded where appropriate. I would like my server to interoperate well with other servers, and the AP specification is so wide open it’s hard to know what kinds of messages my client should expect to have to display.</p>
<p>My question is about structuring images. For now, I’ve been thinking about a structure like this one (in JavaScript, but close enough to JSON for you to get the idea):</p>
<pre><code>{
  type: 'Note',
  content: 'Hello, world!',
  attributedTo: 'https://me.example.com/actor',
  to: 'https://me.example.com/actor/followers',
  attachment: {
    type: 'Image',
    url: {
      type: "Link",
      href: 'https://images.example.com/image.jpeg',
      width: 5120,
      height: 2880,
      mediaType: 'image/jpeg',
      preview: {
        type: "Link",
        href: 'https://images.example.com/image-preview.jpeg',
        width: 512,
        height: 288,
        mediaType: 'image/jpeg'
      }
    }
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>But I recognize that there are myriad other ways to represent the same data. The attachment could simply be a <code>Link</code> with a <code>mediaType</code>. It needn’t be an <code>Image</code> but could simply be a <code>Document</code>, as Mastodon does. The <code>url</code> needn’t be a single object, but an array of multiple links with different <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> from which the client should select. There needn’t be a URL at all, and the image could be encoded into the <code>content</code> field, which is actually the closest to the definition from the <code>attachment</code> spec:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Identifies a resource attached or related to an object that potentially requires special handling. The intent is to provide a model that is at least semantically similar to attachments in email.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don’t want to develop my application to handle every possible representation it might encounter; I’d rather use my finite time for developing features that will actually be used. At the same point, I’d like to strike a reasonable balance of interoperability. The specification is so wide open as to be nearly useless in deciding what formats one should expect to support.</p>

          <title>The ActivityPub test suite</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[cwebber]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Uncategorized</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>test.activitypub.rocks has been down for a long time, as pretty much everyone knows.  More or less it’s server issues, and I can be blamed since I run the server (and wrote the test suite).</p>
<p>Why hasn’t it gone back up though?  Mainly because I’m a) very busy b) know how poor the test suite is at fulfilling the needs of the community and that makes it hard to feel motivated to put in the work.</p>
<p>Here are some quirks about test.activitypub.rocks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It was done in a rush to meet the standards deadline.  The main purpose was to collect implementation reports, and given the rush some things are funny about it.</li>
<li>It was done in <em>such a rush</em> that it’s a completely separate program that’s just bundled straight into the same codebase as the test activitypub implementation I was writing, <a href="https://gitlab.com/dustyweb/pubstrate" rel="nofollow noopener">Pubstrate</a> (which has some good ideas but which I won’t recommend either).</li>
<li>Technically it’s two test suites.  Scratch that, it’s a test suite and a questionaire:
<ul>
<li>There’s a test suite for the client to server protocol, which really does resemble a test suite; it makes many requests against your server and sees if they work right.  (It’s buggy, though.)</li>
<li>There’s a mostly-questionaire (but it runs a couple tests, I think) for the server-to-server protocol.  Why?  Because a) performing a test suite on an asynchronous protocol is already hard enough (when does the test complete?  it can be done with timeouts, but it’s gross) and b) many of the requirements required that <em>some</em> authentication or authorization take place, but due to process reasons we couldn’t specify what that was, and c) at that point we already had an unusual amount of interop, so we decided that if multiple implementations could federate on a feature and could confirm that in the questionaire, we could consider that sufficient.  (Even weirder, some of the questions would involve the server <em>doing something</em> to your server, but then still having a question for the user to confirm if the thing worked.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A proper test suite wouldn’t work like this.  It would be fully automated.</li>
</ul>
<p>It does look pretty though, that’s the only thing I’ll give it credit for. <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>Where to from here?  There are really a few options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do nothing, things remain broken.  Obviously not ideal!</li>
<li>I get back up the test suite.  Again, it’s hard for me to get motivated about this but I could probably do it.  But then I fear once I get it up all I’ll get in response is <em>THIS</em> is the test suite?  WTF, this isn’t a test suite at all!</li>
<li>Someone else could get up the test suite based on the current codebase and I could transfer running it to them.  Notably someone tried this already but they weren’t familiar with Guix, and that’s currently the easiest way to get it up and running <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:">
</li>
<li>Someone else could write a new, much better version of the test suite.  In fact we discussed this on a recent SocialCG call and I was asked how I would feel about that, and I more or less said I thought that would be great.  But someone needs to do it.  Who?  Maybe it’s you!</li>
</ul>
<p>So… what next?</p>

As this forum is not open yet it makes not much difference whether we shut it down or not. But I’m willing to leave it alone so that others can catch up and get ready for an official launch soon.</p>
<p>We should set a launch date so that we can announce publicly and gain traction and momentum. You’re welcome to discuss this here. The <a class="hashtag" href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/tags/todo">#<span>todo</span></a> list still has some items…</p>
<p>Already some topics and categories have been posted, but so far I’ve done most of the work of porting socialhub.network on my own, so I would appreciate that others chime in! Especially there are a number of groups and roles to fill as described in the <strong>wiki</strong> (hint hint): <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/things-to-be-done-before-announcing-the-forum/19/1" class="inline-onebox">Things to be done before announcing the forum</a>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to you, early birds, who came from socialhub.network or from APConf.</p>

            <p>SocialHub.ActivityPub.Rocks hosts ActivityPub free software developers and enthusiasts to study and share knowledge, specify functionality together, steer the course of ActivityPub W3C Recommendation through code, conversation, consistency, cooperation…</p>
<p>We welcome both technical and non-technical discussion. Non-technical discussion should focus on cooperation across, between, and beyond projects; governance of the commons; ethics and aesthetics; etc.</p>
<p><em>Is it your first time using Discourse? Try sending a message to <a class="mention" href="/u/discobot">@discobot</a>.</em></p>
<p>Each category has a pinned topic (tagged with <a class="hashtag" href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/tag/about">#<span>about</span></a>)  which explains the expected norms and limits of the category. This facilitates keeping discussion on topic. Don’t worry about <em>drifting</em> though: we can always move topics and posts around if needed. Let the conversation be respectful and reproductive!</p>
<p>You can get started with the <a class="hashtag" href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/tag/welcome">#<span>welcome</span></a> topics to get an bird’s eye view and feeling about how to engage with this community.
