<p>This amendment would be reaching a first goal for the Policy Group.<br>
I was in Strasbourg last week as mentioned, talked with Jan Penfrat of edri and afterwards <a class="mention" href="/u/cristinadelisle">@CristinaDeLisle</a> and me did a short meeting.</p>

He wants to learn about ActivityPub and so maybe a small group can explain and dream a littlebit.</p>
<p>We also planned to have a roundtable event together with <a href="https://edri.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DSA_EDRiPositionPaper.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">edri</a> - Jan Penfrat proposed to ‚Äústick together after the summer break‚Äù</p>

          <title>Grant proposal for federation in Gitea</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dachary]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi <a class="mention" href="/u/cjs">@cjs</a>,</p>
<p>Only now do I discover the <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/go-fed-work-tracker-megathread/1170">Go-Fed Work Tracker Megathread</a> and the grant proposal part:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Write <a href="https://nlnet.nl/propose/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">NGI0 Discovery</a> grant proposals:
<ul>
<li>For ActivityPub <a href="https://github.com/go-fed/testsuite" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">testsuite</a> completion</li>
<li>For engineering of an OCAP-based transport/routing protocol based off of <a href="https://github.com/cjslep/eris" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">eris</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cjslep/scr" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">scr</a>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I would be very motivated to work with you on a grant application to implement <a href="https://discourse.gitea.io/t/forgefed-federation-in-gitea/1157" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">federation in Gitea with go-fed</a>. I have <a href="https://forum.fedeproxy.eu/c/funding/5" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">some experience</a> and although I do not really enjoy the administrative process (I‚Äôm a developer at heart), I acknowledge that there is value in <a href="https://forum.fedeproxy.eu/uploads/short-url/67QsDhlh47dpvuJxZf4hAsffZF9.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">clearly articulating the goals and outline the process to get there</a>.</p>
<p>To the best of my knowledge there is no ongoing call for proposal at the moment, therefore no pressure, which I like (being extremely bad at doing things at the last minute). There will however surely be at least a few open calls by the end of the year and it would help continue the effort that will hopefully be bootstrapped if a developer is motivated to take baby steps with <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/14186" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">the seed funding</a> (tiny tiny seed <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/seedling.png?v=9" title=":seedling:" class="emoji" alt=":seedling:"> <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"> ) that was made available this week to work on federation for Gitea.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

          <title>Implementing Paginated Inbox Collections</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[mag]]></dc:creator>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Hi All!</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been enjoying reading through the AS/AP specs, and have started writing my own little project - I might be confident enough to publicise it here once it‚Äôs further developed.</p>
<p>Sorry to drop a question as soon as I join the community; I do plan on interacting with you folks in more than just this topic <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>
<p>When reading the specs, specifically the portions on inboxes and collections, I‚Äôve been having trouble figuring out how to make paginated collections when the underlying collection is prone to change frequently.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/#inbox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ActivityPub spec</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The inbox is discovered through the <code>inbox</code> property of an actor‚Äôs profile. The <code>inbox</code> <em>MUST</em> be an  <code>OrderedCollection</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think I understand this: when an authorised client <code>GET</code>s someone‚Äôs inbox URL, they‚Äôre sent back an <code>OrderedCollection</code> describing that someone‚Äôs inbox. If the content of their inbox is small enough, this response could include references to all of the items in someone‚Äôs inbox (or maybe it could even include all of the items), but I‚Äôm interested in the case where a person‚Äôs inbox is too large to include al of the references in a single response: the case where pagination is required.</p>
<p>Collections with pages can include the properties <code>first</code>, <code>current</code>, and <code>last</code>; the distinction between the first two confuses me.</p>
<p>From the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">ActivityStreams vocabulary</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>current</code>: Notes: In a paged <code>Collection</code> , indicates the page that contains the most recently updated member items.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><code>first</code>: Notes: In a paged <code>Collection</code> , indicates the furthest preceeding page of items in the collection.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an <code>OrderedCollection</code> in reverse chronological order, are these properties different from one another? In my head, ‚Äúfurthest-preceeding‚Äù and ‚Äúcontains the most recently updated member items‚Äù can both mean two different things in this situation, and so both properties could mean either of:</p>
<ol>
<li>The provided reference will always point to the same page of items, as it was the ‚Äúnewest‚Äù/‚Äúyoungest‚Äù/‚Äúmost-recently-updated‚Äù page <em>at the time of your <code>GET</code> request to the inbox</em>;</li>
<li>The provided reference is a reference to content that may change over time, because it is a reference to the ‚Äúnewest‚Äù/etc. content <em>at the time of your <code>GET</code> request to the page</em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I can think of two possibilities that seem sensible to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>first</code> and <code>current</code> both refer to <span class="hashtag">#2:</span> you can include both with the same value, or omit one;</li>
<li>
<code>first</code> refers to <span class="hashtag">#1</span>; <code>current</code> refers to <span class="hashtag">#2</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are solutions for <span class="hashtag">#1</span> and <span class="hashtag">#2</span>, so really my issue is just down to what these properties are <em>meant</em> to represent. Are there solid examples of these properties in use that I haven‚Äôt come across?</p>
<p>Hopefully there‚Äôs enough possible discussion here to warrant this being a ‚Äútopic‚Äù - I‚Äôm brand new to Discourse, so I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm doing <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/stuck_out_tongue.png?v=9" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" class="emoji" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:"></p>

<p>There are many developments and opportunities that exist now. And I think most fedizens are not in the loop. Therefore this wiki post to plan a meeting to discuss the ins and outs.</p>

            <p>Hello,<br>
I am new to setting up instances of federated servers. I am trying to set up gancio, but seem to be going wrong somewhere in the servers config. It remains showing the Nginx setup page at my IP address (<a href="http://45.77.164.185/" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">http://45.77.164.185/</a>)  and nothing at our website (thebeehive.events). If anyone is available to help it would be much appreciated! When I‚Äôm done, I plan to submit some proposals for the documentation in order to make it more friendly to new users.</p>

            <p>I just created my first post on this Discourse instance, and because I‚Äôm new here I can only post two links. Understandable, but rather annoying. So I was thinking: isn‚Äôt there a way to fediversify Discourse, particularly my Reputation?</p>
<p>E.g. in the AntennaPod forum we could set SocialHub as a ‚Äòtrusted trust source‚Äô and allow users to benefit from their trust levels gained elsewhere.</p>

          <title>Using ActivityPub for Podcast Comments (exploration)</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[keunes]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Fediverse Futures</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Dear ActivityPub community!</p>
<p>I‚Äôm somewhat active in the Podcasting 2.0 community. This community works on the <strong>Podcast Namespace</strong>, which extends the RSS standard with new tags for podcasts. For example the <code>podcast:person</code> tag (to identify individuals heard in the podcast, both presenters and guests), or the <code>podcast:funding</code> tag (to indicate ways to financially support the podcaster). Podcast hosts should support them; podcast apps should use them.</p>
<p>The loose group is now also discussing <strong>comments</strong> (via a <code>podcast:comments</code> tag), and one venue that is being explored is ActivityPub.</p>
<p>The goal here is a YouTube-comment-like-experience. But then in some decentralised fashion. I see some open questions regarding</p>
<ul>
<li>hosting (where are the comments hosted; by podcast host, podcaster, podcast client app, or another specialised comment entity)</li>
<li>moderation (should probably be the responsibility of the podcaster, but this depends on who hosts the comments)</li>
<li>inclusion (should comments be gathered through a hashtag of some sorts, or is there a single thread that is displayed)</li>
<li>initiation (who gets to ‚Äòstart‚Äô a comment thread, and who has control over this (client app, podcaster, no-one))</li>
<li>technology (should we rely on Mastodon, or create a ‚Äònew‚Äô ActivityPub-based standard specific to comments? If something new, in which ways should it federate?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Adam &amp; Dave (who basically initiated the Podcasting 2.0 community) are discussing  the comments concept here - I would recommend listening to it because it probably gives a better idea than my summary above:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://podcastindex.org/podcast/920666" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">Podcasting 2.0</a>: Episode 44: Separating the Nodes from the Noobs<br>
<a href="https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/PC20-44-2021-07-02-Final.mp3#t=5617" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">https://mp3s.nashownotes.com/PC20-44-2021-07-02-Final.mp3#t=5617</a> [01:33:37]</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>It would be great if the ActivityPub community could chip in.</strong> Every 1,5 week or so there‚Äôs a community developer meeting, and the first next one is Wednesday 7 July at 20:00 CEST. I‚Äôm pretty sure that Podcast Comments will be on the agenda for that meeting.</p>

1) We plan on using ActivityPub for comments.  This already exists and works.  That's ActivityPub (Mastodon style).  Just taking time to get to help with implementation details, we're catching up on other things.
2) I'm like you, Adam,...</p>

          <title>How to Empower Local Communities/Organizations with Fediverse applications?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[dorian]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Fediverse Futures</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Lately I‚Äôve been thinking about how I might be able to propose some fediverse applications to some local organizations in my area in order to enhance and replace (in that order) their organization efforts on the large closed social media platforms. I think working with already existing groups tied to geographic areas could bring some great grassroots power to the fediverse.</p>
<p>Something that I think is really important in approaching this is that communities themselves know best what they need. I know that if I come in just talking about the ways in which Mastodon mimics or is better than Twitter people will just ignore me. As they should, if I come in speaking before listening.</p>
<p>Has anyone else worked with local groups on these things? What were some pitfalls? Benefits?</p>
<p>Two pros of fediverse social media that I‚Äôve been mulling over, both related to moderation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising based social media means that when participating in your group members get served ads that you have no control over. I‚Äôve heard stories from some People of Color that they got served racist ads, ads that they felt were targeted to do harm. That‚Äôs a problem fediverse social media can solve.</li>
<li>Fediverse social media has many more options for moderation. On Facebook many groups are set to private in order to protect members. This closes them off, less able to communicate with other groups. Federation enables groups to be selectively closed to some groups and open to others.</li>
</ul>

          <title>A system allowing existing user to vouch for new invitees</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[lrhodes]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Fediverse Futures</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>I mentioned this <strong>feature idea</strong> over <a href="https://merveilles.town/@lrhodes/106495932606975203" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">on Mastodon</a>, and a few people suggested I suggest it here as well: Some sort of semantic relation between accounts, built into an instance‚Äôs invitation and/or registration function, indicating that the newer account was admitted at the request of the older.</p>
<p>You can think of it as a profile-based system for recording when one user <em>vouched for</em> adding another. On the one hand, this would add a slightly different way of mapping the semantic relationships between accounts, on top of the follows, which are more gregarious. The vouched-for/by linkage between accounts would imply some measure of trust and entail some measure of responsibility. As such, fostering those relations could encourage community-building.</p>
<p>That‚Äôs somewhat aspirational, though. The more immediate practical effect is that baking vouched-for/by relationships into profiles would give moderators a tool for working through mediation procedures.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose you moderate an invite-only instance. An active member  ‚Äî call her Helga ‚Äî DMs you and asks, ‚ÄúHey, can my pal Ogbar get an invite?‚Äù Sure thing. You go into the mod panel to generate the invite. One of the options is a checkbox labelled ‚ÄúVouched by‚Ä¶‚Äù or something to that effect. Checking that activates a text field/drop down. From that, you select Helga‚Äôs account name. Now, when Ogbar uses the invite link, the account he creates will be permanently linked to Helga‚Äôs account in a semantic relationship that‚Äôs visible to moderators.</p>
<p>Weeks pass. One day, Ogbar does something that requires moderation. A glance at his account would tell you who requested their invite. So rather than jumping straight to a ban or some other heavy-handed measure, you can ask Helga to mediate. You may not even need to ask ‚Äî maybe just knowing that that act of having vouched for Ogbar is baked into their accounts encourages Helga to feel just a little responsible for Ogbar‚Äôs behavior, and she steps in of her own volition.</p>
<p>But let‚Äôs say that things don‚Äôt work out that way. Helga never steps in and is unresponsive to friendly requests for mediation. Ogbar‚Äôs behavior worsens, and eventually you feel compelled to ban him. Then, a year later, Helga DMs you and asks,  ‚ÄúHey, can my pal Ryuchi get an invite?‚Äù The Ogbar episode is no longer fresh in your mind, so you look at her profile for a refresher. Oh, right‚Ä¶ Maybe her vouching for a prospective user shouldn‚Äôt count for so much, huh? Informed, you can better weigh how to handle her request ‚Äî whether that means turning it down flat, basing your decision on some other factor (like Ryuchi‚Äôs social media history elsewhere), or warning Helga that banning another user she vouched for will mean tighter restrictions on her account in the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are some implementation questions that need to be worked out (e.g. would these relations be public, or visible only to the moderators and the accounts linked by vouching?), but I think it‚Äôs an idea worth exploring.</p>

            <p>Owncast recently hit it‚Äôs 1 year anniversary of being a project.  Federation has been on the todo list since day one, but I always wanted to do it for the right reasons, to solve real problems.  Once enough features bubbled up that all felt like they all fell into the ActivityPub bucket the time has come.</p>
<p>Seems like SocialHub is the place to be to post progress, questions and to learn what everyone else is up to.  So while I‚Äôm a newbie to the scene, I‚Äôm looking forward to becoming more embedded in it all.</p>
<p>Thanks for everyone who have been so positive about Owncast and our future plans.</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Bonjour,</p>
<p>I‚Äôm curious to hear what people involved in Codeberg ( <a href="https://codeberg.org/6543" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">6543 - Codeberg.org</a>  <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/eyes.png?v=9" title=":eyes:" class="emoji" alt=":eyes:"> ) have in mind regarding federation. Will there be multiple independent instances of Codeberg working together in a federated way? Is it something that is worked on in Gitea (via <a class="mention" href="/u/cjs">@cjs</a> <a href="https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/issues/14186" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">go-fed integration</a> maybe ?). Or something else entirely?</p>
<p>I‚Äôve not seen recent activity on this topic but since I‚Äôm not involved in the Gitea/Codeberg community, it is entirely possible that I missed something <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/slight_smile.png?v=9" title=":slight_smile:" class="emoji" alt=":slight_smile:"></p>

          <title>How do I store activities and objects in an SQL database?</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[protheory8]]></dc:creator>
          <category>ActivityPub</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>There are two ways of doing that I can think about:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a table for each activity type and store them there.</li>
<li>Have a one big <code>activities</code> table and store activities as JSON.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of those options seem to have some serious disadvantages, the former one makes it difficult to get all activities from one actor in the chronological order and is not very scalable, the latter one doesn‚Äôt allow me to know what actor created the activity and other data without parsing JSON first.</p>
<p>Is there a better way than using those two option? Or is there a way to ‚Äúfix‚Äù disadvantages that I mentioned?</p>

<p>You  <img src="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/images/emoji/twitter/sparkling_heart.png?v=9" title=":sparkling_heart:" class="emoji" alt=":sparkling_heart:">  love Fediverse, right? It‚Äôs vibrant unique culture and the lovely people you meet. You want to protect it, increase its beauty, see more applications interoperate seamlessly. You know that you are part of a ‚Äòreimagining of social networking‚Äô that is much needed, as traditional social media are destroying the fabric of society.</p>
<p>What you may not know is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Fediverse is still incredibly weak. That it has a tiny community of technologists that evolve it, and that this process is stalling as people are absorbed in their own projects. (‚ÄúThe Tragedy of the Grassroots Movement?‚Äù)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That what Fediverse currently offers is just the tiny tip of the iceberg. That humongous potential still lies dormant, waiting to be explored. That we can go <em>way</em> beyond microblogging features that dominate the fedi now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That YOU are instrumental in tapping this potential, and that you don‚Äôt have to be a techie to help with that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks">SocialHub community</a> we come together to improve the Fediverse, evolve its standards and the ecosystem. And regardless of your skills and expertise we need all the help we can get to move forwards, to progress this thing we love.</p>
<p>Throw off your individualism and become a fedi builder. It‚Äôs a win-win for all. We are ‚ÄòUnited in Diversity‚Äô and should build together. Join SocialHub as member and interact. And also join <a href="https://lemmy.ml/c/fediversefutures">Fediverse Futures on Lemmy</a> to brainstorm on exciting ideas.</p>
<p>We are <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/socialhub-and-spiral-island-a-fediverse-foundation-analogy/1543">Spiral Island</a> still, and can become a sprawling archipelago.</p>

          <title>Querying ActivityPub collections</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[grishka]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Server to Server</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>It‚Äôs me again with my efforts to extend collections. This is somewhat of a continuation of the discussion started in the <a class="hashtag" href="/tag/fep-400e">#<span>fep-400e</span></a> topic, but I feel like it warrants having a topic (and at some point a FEP) of its own.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it‚Äôs useful to have the ability to issue a single request to ask a remote instance ‚Äúdoes this collection contain this object?‚Äù for an authoritative answer. This can be useful both for collection synchronization and to enforce bilateral relationships.</p>
<p>Example <span class="hashtag">#1</span>. There‚Äôs a wall post made by a user from instance A on the wall of a group on instance B (in accordance to my <a class="hashtag" href="/tag/fep-400e">#<span>fep-400e</span></a>). The user from instance A mentions a user from instance C in a reply to that post. The instance C fetches both the post and the reply to display them to its local user in a notification. <em>How does instance C verify that instance B has approved that parent post?</em></p>
<p>Example <span class="hashtag">#2</span>. A user from instance A and a user from instance B add each other as friends. They each have a ‚Äúfriends‚Äù collection that contains all such connections. Each sends an Add activity to their followers to keep friend lists in sync across instances. <em>How do recipients verify that this relationship was actually established on the other end if they only follow one of the users?</em></p>
<p>Currently, there‚Äôs no non-ugly way to do this ‚Äî the only way you can get something out of a collection is by going through its pages. I‚Äôd like to discuss an easy way to query a collection, for example, using a well-defined query parameter or an HTTP header. You‚Äôd send a request to the collection ID URL, specifying the ID of the object you‚Äôre checking for, and the response would be one of three discernible states:</p>
<ul>
<li>The collection contains the object</li>
<li>The collection does not contain the object</li>
<li>Inconclusive ‚Äî the server doesn‚Äôt support responding to these requests</li>
</ul>

          <title>Bulding information sources with lasting value</title>
          <dc:creator><![CDATA[VictorVenema]]></dc:creator>
          <category>Fediverse Futures</category>
          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>Mastodon is a huge step-up from Twitter. The Signal to Noise Ratio is much better. With all this valuable information flowing by and so many people investing a lot of time into creating quality content, I increasingly wonder whether we could use that energy to jointly build knowledge bases.</p>
<p>A second starting point of my thinking is the Delightful List (on Open Science) I am creating with <a class="mention" href="/u/aschrijver">@aschrijver</a> on Codeberg. (This is similar to the Awesome Lists on GitHub).  And I am also compiling a list of all groups that work on digital things in my city, which I thought to publish on a local Wiki. Hopefully this local lists will be followed by other topics (housing, environment, sports, ‚Ä¶) happening in my city, so I was thinking of Wiki (rather than a GIT repository) to make it less technical to add and edit it for normal people.</p>
<p>Then I just listened to a talk at the Open Repositories conference. In de end I am not sure they actually did this, but initially it sounded like the system they were building would suggest interesting datasets to researchers using their repositories. Suggesting potentially interesting articles, datasets and code would be very useful for science. Currently you have to wade through a lot to find the few things that you need.</p>
<p>Before writing this up, I remembered that Mastodon nowadays has bookmarks. So the step to social bookmarking is no longer that big.</p>
<p>Putting all of this together. Would it be possible to create a system where you bookmark interesting toots, posts and webpages (either in Mastodon or your browser), which are stored by default in a bulk list. My browser bookmark menu is extensive. That would be the next step: categorizing the bookmarks.</p>
<p>Some of these categories could be public. Some could be jointly edited with friends. Some could be based on hashtags (probably best moderated before becoming publicly visible). Once a category is sufficiently filled a machine learning tool could also suggest interesting toots and posts (again probably best moderated before becoming public) from the toots and RSS feeds you missed.</p>
<p>Some of these collections could also take into account how current the information is. If the curator would estimate how long a toot or post remains relevant, the system could sort the collection by how (relatively) timely the links are (or, e.g., replace the announcement of the 2021 conference with a link to the conference series).</p>
<p>Above such a collection people could write a short summary on the topic. This could be done like a Wikipage (as long as all links go to pre-approved URLs from the link collection, spam risks are small and everyone (not just the group making the collection) could join in writing/editing such a text).</p>
<p>Just a thought. How could we improve this idea? What existing systems already do something (somewhat) similar?</p>

          <description><![CDATA[
            <p>unfortunately i keep running into problems with parsing json-ld and the problem that others can‚Äôt interpret ‚Äúmy‚Äù json-ld. if i take ‚Äúmy‚Äù json-ld and paste it into <a href="https://json-ld.org/playground/" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">JSON-LD Playground</a> everything seems to be ok.<br>
So it looks like activityPub implementations speak a different json-ld. But I have the feeling that this json-ld is not specified.<br>
Am I the only one with this problem?<br>
I don‚Äôt want to write a json-ld parser/generator, but use libraries that exist and are provided in the RDF context. At the moment I rely on <a href="https://github.com/jsonld-java/jsonld-java" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - jsonld-java/jsonld-java: JSON-LD implementation for Java</a> which is used in the context of rdf4j.</p>
<p>Framing does not seem to solve the problem either. At least it didn‚Äôt with Pleroma.</p>

            <p>Does there exist node software that implements only the ActivityPub protocol?</p>
<p>In some decentralized networks, protocol stuff is taken care of by one piece of software which then exposes an interface for application specific code to use. I‚Äôm only some days into an in-depth exploration of AP, but wondering if any such domain-agnostic software exists here.</p>

            <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I‚Äôve spent the last decade working on software and attempting to understand decentralization as a social phenomenon. I come to this community in search of understanding, opportunity and a desire to do something that matters.</p>
<p>My journey started a couple decades ago with the free software movement and the four freedoms. I learned then that my thinking is particularly oriented toward the user, or the person, and ultimately humanity. That led me to support lots of people with their computers and technology and later developing software since it scales so damn well.</p>
<p>After noticing the astronomical value users were creating for proprietary software developers, and seeing social networks as more of the same, I wondered how users could benefit from the value they were creating in the form of a user-owned social network. If it was going to happen, the system would need to handle money to pay for servers at least, and PayPal came to mind. It was at this time though that PayPal shut down Wikileaks. I went looking for other ways to send money online which could not be shutdown and found Bitcoin.</p>
<p>This took me on another important leg of the journey toward understanding decentralization, when it works, how it works, what are the tradeoffs, and how it can be fostered. Fast forward to today, I wish to spend my free time on something truly important and again I return to this orientation toward humanity.</p>
<p>Many of today‚Äôs problems have been developing for decades as corporate power grew consistently putting profits over people. It is my belief that the most effective tools for reasserting sovereignty in the future will come through open source software and decentralization which returns privacy and agency to the individual.</p>
<p>The last couple of weeks, I‚Äôve been doing a deep dive on the fediverse, examining Mastodon and Diaspora code and the AP spec, thinking about how I can best help these and other federated free software platforms and networks.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm glad to be joining you all and looking forward to what we can all do together.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

          <title>Smithereen 0.1 beta is out!</title>

            <p>I‚Äôm finally confident enough in this thing to say that it‚Äôs okay for others to run their own instances. It might be rough around the edges, but it does work well enough that I myself at times use it more than Mastodon.</p>
<p>You can run it either directly or in Docker. Code, prebuilt jar and instructions here: <a href="https://github.com/grishka/Smithereen" class="inline-onebox" rel="noopener nofollow ugc">GitHub - grishka/Smithereen: Federated, ActivityPub-compatible social network server with friends, walls, and groups.</a></p>
<p>Federation-related limitations to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only public posts are supported. For the time being, that‚Äôs intentional. Non-public posts are rejected with a ‚Äúbad request‚Äù error.</li>
<li>Polls are not supported yet so these posts don‚Äôt show up anywhere.</li>
<li>There‚Äôs currently no UI to load an external post or profile. You can, however, use Mastodon‚Äôs ‚Äúenter your username@domain to interact with this‚Äù popup, or you can open <code>https://your.instance/activitypub/externalInteraction?uri=https://...</code> directly.</li>
<li>Loading older posts for an account isn‚Äôt supported yet.</li>
<li>Boosts/reposts do show up in feed but you can‚Äôt make one yourself. That‚Äôs because I want more of a VK-like behavior where each repost has its own comment thread, which is not yet implemented.</li>

          <title>Proposal: New top-level forum section for Domains</title>

            <p>With a host of <a href="https://socialhub.activitypub.rocks/t/hospitality-exchange-community-considers-moving-to-the-fediverse/1765">Hospitality platforms</a> now considering federation, and already a bunch of different application categories being covered by various apps (Microblogging, of course, Blogging, Media platforms, etc.) I would like to propose adding a new top-level forum section ‚ÄúDomains‚Äù for this. A subcategory would then be ‚ÄúDomains/Hospitality‚Äù.</p>
<p>Though <a class="hashtag" href="/c/fediversity/fediverse-futures/58">#<span>fediversity:fediverse-futures</span></a> can be used for general-purpose discussion, these domain subcategories are meant to deep-dive into e.g. specific vocabulary extensions, messaging patterns and all kinds of other interop issues that are specific to apps within that domain.</p>
