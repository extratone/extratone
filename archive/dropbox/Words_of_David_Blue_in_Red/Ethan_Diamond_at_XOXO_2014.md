"We run Bandcamp as a virtual company, so we don’t have an office - we’re spread out all over the world. For communication, we use a group chat system - we used to use IRC and then we recently switched to Slack.”

“We started as a service to help artists sell their music and merchandise directly to their fans, but then as the site grew - it’s now at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums - we evolved into also being a destination for music discovery.”

“At a higher level, our objective is to be the best way for fans to directly support the artists they love.”

“The best way to support an artist is to pay them directly.”

“Fans have given $81 million to dates and they give artists about $3 million a month.”

“We worked out of the public library for the first four years of the company's existence."

“Shifting all of our music consumption to subscription-based streaming risks losing something that’s culturally important… the idea of a music collection.”

“There’ve been 11 million transactions now on Bandcamp.”

“If you actually care about music and you care about the people who make it and you want them to keep making it, the best way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to use services that allow you to directly support them.”

“It allows us to retain the concept of a music collection in the streaming world.”
