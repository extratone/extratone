I don’t want you to think this is just another listicle to mark as spam or ignore completely – though it technically is, I suppose. I know how it looks… because I’ve run into many of them and have been just as irritated as you. In fact, I would be so bold as to presume I’ve run into *many many* more than you have simply because a primary hobby of mine has always been Just Trying to Do Things On The Computer without any academic authority or hands-on training. This is a way of life for my generation and those proceeding it, yes, but I promise you that I have gone far, far deeper than the vast majority of anyone you know. What I’m ultimately trying to do here is to spare you the hundreds – perhaps *thousands* – of hours I have had to spend mulling through shitty workflows throughout my childhood and adulthood before I stumbled upon Good Practices (i.e. Better Ways to Do Things.)

I want you to come away from this list feeling as liberated and powerful as I do now when I’m On My Computer without any condescension or tedium. Unfortunately, there’s probably going to be some of both, so please stick with me and don’t take it personally. I do *a lot* of online reading, writing, and fiddling. I’ve been compelled to do these things in one form or another since very early childhood, and what follows could be described as a list of my favorite tools to accomplish things. Almost all of them are entirely free to use and the vast majority of them are easily and beautifully functional as well. They are what I suggest for my own mother to use, for what that’s worth, and I would argue sincerely for their extreme importance. *Don’t waste your life on bad software.*

## You Need a Password Manager

In 2020, password managers are no longer optional for digital life. **They are mandatory**. If you only ever heed a single piece of my advice, ever, *please* make it this one. [Most password managers available](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-password-managers) are secure, cross-platform, optionally cloud-synced tools that help you generate, store, and organize digital credentials. More likely than not, you’re already using one in your favorite browser. On MacOS and iOS, Safari is linked to a service called Keychain, which is – functionally – a robust password manager. On signup for a given website or service, Safari should prompt you to automatically generate secure, complex passwords to store in Keychain. Generally, it’s pretty smart about knowing when it’s time to retrieve the credentials with Touch-ID, but for when it *isn’t*, you should know [how to manually retrieve passwords from Keychain](https://support.apple.com/guide/keychain-access/what-is-keychain-access-kyca1083/mac). If you’re deeply enough embedded into the Mac ecosystem, you can feel free to continue to rely on this process as long as you know how to help yourself when it fails. I’m not going to tell you who to trust, but I do *almost* actually believe in Apple’s commitment to securing user data, if only because of the way their incentives are aligned (in contrast with those in front of data-funded organizations like Google.)

If you’re using a Windows Home Machine and/or an Android smartphone, I believe it’s more urgent that you find a standalone password management solution immediately. I use a gorgeous app called [Enpass](https://www.enpass.io/) to store all of my passwords as well as my bank credentials, credit cards, driver’s license information, and anything else I might need to keep handy, securely. I can use virtually any cloud or file-sharing service to keep my “vaults” synced between all of my devices: Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, Box, etc, and I also regularly create encrypted local backups just in case. I can even *share* end-to-end encrypted credentials with another device or Enpass installation. I migrated to Enpass two years ago after using [1Password](https://www.consumerreports.org/password-managers/best-password-managers-review-digital-security-privacy-ease-of-use/) for nearly 10. It was intuitive and virtually seamless, as such things in software tend to be these days, and as a result, I haven’t had to memorize a single password since my adolescence. Enpass allows me to create custom login templates for quick differentiation when creating new entries as well as picturized categories and tags. With one click, even the icon can be pulled from a given URL’s favicon to help keep my vault looking visually itemized. It also includes presets for a hundred services or so – from Google to Wix to Yahoo! Japan.

## Total Recall with a Clipboard Manager

Imagine if everything you had ever copied (as in **Ctrl-C**) were listed in linear order, [easily and instantly searchable](https://vimeo.com/407790756) via a single global keyboard shortcut (**Alt-`**) and navigable with the arrow keys. Imagine if you could then export an archive of your clipboard so *nothing* could ever be lost. Imagine clipboard *tabs* that are easily switchable. [CopyQ](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/) – an “advanced clipboard manager” – is one of my favorite software discoveries of all time. Some workdays, I use it literally hundreds of instances in my workflow. It is difficult to describe how much more useful it makes the clipboard feature – something we’ve all been using for decades, now. For someone like me who [copies a ridiculous amount of links every day](https://extratone.com/three-years-of-good-reads), CopyQ’s functionality has truly become *life-changing*.

## Alt-D and Other Keyboard Shortcuts

Somehow, I did not discover **Alt-D** until 2018, which means that I had spent the entirety of my 24 years since *triple-clicking* to select every single URL I’d ever copied. I built a media company this way, and I can’t believe nobody told me about this shortcut. Open any given web browser, use **Alt-D**, and your selection will move to the URL in the address bar on top of the page. It’s very possible this will be of little use to you, but anyone who regularly shares or copies links will save themselves *so* much time. I felt the same way when I discovered text navigation with **Alt**, **Shift**, **Ctrl** + the arrow keys. Most of these are cross-platform, but I am specifically focusing on [Windows shortcuts](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12445/windows-keyboard-shortcuts) for this piece because that’s what I’m currently using.

## Arrow key-related shortcuts
- **Shift** in conjunction with the arrow keys selects text in a document surrounding the cursor.
- **Alt** in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to go forward or backward in a browser.
- **Ctrl** in conjunction with the arrow keys allows one to navigate text by word.
- 

Virtually all of the “Windows logo key” shortcuts are usable in day-to-day workflows. I use **Win-D** to immediately minimize all windows and show the desktop on the regular. Microsoft is [currently testing](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21224904/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-details) a feature like MacOS’ spotlight which is triggered with this key.


> Designed to replace the existing Win + R shortcut, the new launcher will include options to quickly search apps and files across Windows and support for plugins like calculators, dictionaries, and search engines.

We can only hope this feature will be as useful as spotlight (which is triggered with **⌘-Spacebar** for you Mac users,) and will be implemented as standard as soon as possible.
