The United Methodist Church on ninth is nearly as Columbian as The Crossing - the minimegachurch [famous](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/movies/how-the-true-false-film-festival-and-a-church-work-together.html?_r=0) for its connections to True/False. Its white tower watches over The Golden Way, which cuts a very lucrative swath through the area's premiere bars, novelty food shops, coffee joints, and restaurants. There's even an artisanal Olive Oil Hole.

“wo opposing venues can be found in the house of the lord: a converted gymnasium called "The Picturehouse," and an utterly pious & silent little room with stained glass and surprisingly realistic arches, fittingly named "Little Chapel." The latter hosts intimate, minimally structured conversations between directors, artists, subjects, etc. called "Field Sessions."

----------

I'm winded as I approach the second of today's such events after Strutting Big to make it on time, but all is well as I enter. *Lindy Lou, Juror Number 2*'s very French director Florent Vassault sits opposite his Lindy Lou Isonhood, herself, facing rows of red hymnal-laden pews and watched by a small, but ultra earnest-looking gathering, and twin, tripoded television cameras. (I'm assuming the staff intends to finally begin making use of their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2w3aPm6jZLeW4qHYo2SHrA) again.)

As we settle and the cameras are set, True/False programmer Abby Sun explains that this particular session - called "Ask Me a Question" - involves written questions on paper slips, stuffed in two separate (and logoed) paper bags, which she delivers to the two's table. Their authorship has been shared between Abby, her programming team, and the two guests, themselves. Taking turns is encouraged, and they're allowed to "pass."

Lindy's accent is quintessentially Mississippian, but still sellable; Florence speaks in the French equivalent. It's disclaimed that they are sharing the stage as a resolute republican and liberal democrat, respectively, but it's immediately obvious that their friendship's depth has stayed all possible malice.

Vassault is prompted by a slip to describe 'the ideal Lindy,' and chuckles.

"A very liberal Lindy.”

And that's that with ideological identifiers. The two are refreshingly brisk in their permeating omission of stated assumptions. Their preference for storytelling over essayism is expected to go without saying.

I'm able to deduce that Lindy played a part in condemning a convicted criminal to death, and Vassault was present to capture every nuance of her action's effects on her psychology, which eliminates all need for deduction in determining the origin of their friendship.

They utilize the intimacy they've been allowed to a measured degree, which charms without alienating the audience to third-wheel status, and progress with the appropriate confidence to depart their bags for relevant tangents without neglecting to make use of their prompts, or losing sight of their setting's purpose.

If we observers are internally conversing, it's drawn again and again to the *contrast* between the personalities, but it's far from taboo for the two; it's a mainstay in their working relationship and the personal growth that defines it. What vacuum there may exist between them is well-contained within a vessel of absolutes, and relegated to a space in their relationship that seems less and less significant amidst its nuances as they accumulate.

----------

It's bizarre how quickly such a format took myself from utter ignorance to a complex understanding of their friendship and its roots in their project. Learning the entire extent of what I now know about *Juror Number 2* exclusively by listening to its two most-invested individuals describe and discuss the context of its creation is a direct reversal of the cinematic absorption I've known. To the True/False devout, or the docunerd, I'd imagine this information seems stupendously dull. (I'm assuming they're no longer reading.)

But if this is still the "transformative," anti-festival it touts in its founding principles, surely my ignorance about this film - and film, in general - constitutes an on-mission experience, albeit a mild one, compared to today's spectacularly eccentric "March March," or the chaotic promise of tomorrow's "Gimme Truth!"

Perhaps it's pretentious, but this accumulation of storytelling evangelicalism was bound to enchant me. Before presuming the authority to proclaim "it's bound to enchant *us*" should at least wait until Monday.

Making so plain their regard for each other and their empathetic & attentive habits in conversation is perhaps an implicit demonstration for our sake. That is We, the Nation of Screamers, who have now definitively and unipartisanally lost all ability to communicate with one another and retreated entirely insto our own ideological neurosis.

Conversations like the "Field Sessions" aren't grasping for our collars, there, intending to rip us out. Nor are they a featureless light designed to seduce us with utopianism, or warm us until we burst out ourselves. They're tangible demonstrators who're willing to play in their own shadows if it shows substance in illumination.

No matter how ridiculous the metaphor, they are human beings who speak and listen.
