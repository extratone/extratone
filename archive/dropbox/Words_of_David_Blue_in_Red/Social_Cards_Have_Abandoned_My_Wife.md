## The bizarre, cross-platform tale. 

If you’ve spent any time on the modern web (even if only to navigate to this page,) you’ve seen the widget-esque preview elements that accompany URLs on sites and services like Facebook and Twitter. There’s a surprising lack of citable literature on their developmental history and/or technical interworkings save for the various [web admin-targeted guides](http://eepurl.com/b2Q8nb) published by the same. Our website has special software for [Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/guides/getting-started) and [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/) cards that attaches a tailorable title, description, and featured image via their APIs. When everything is working correctly, our links should look like this when shared.

According to all available documentation, the process of data transfer necessary for unique, editable previews takes place server-side, via crawlers, which should render differences in device/software/author of a given post a non-variable. However, in the two years I have known my wife [Hawthorn](http://twitter.com/hawthorn_jr), social cards on her posts to Twitter and our Discord have been unreliable at best - completely nonexistent on the latter. Below, you’ll notice that the same URL posted to the [reading list](http://extratone.com/read) sequentially attached social cards for me, but not for her.

She’s tried reinstalling the application on both her Galaxy S8 and her old laptop to no avail. I’ve tried searching Reddit and Discord’s forums without significant result. On Twitter, it appears to be intermittent. I can remember seeing inexplicably naked links from her account, but we couldn’t replicate the error when we tried today. Of course, she’ll live on having missed very little if the curse never lifts, but the issue brought about some interesting questions which seem astonishingly difficult to answer.
