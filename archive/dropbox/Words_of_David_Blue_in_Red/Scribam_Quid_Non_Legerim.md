# Scribam Quid Non Legerim
*What does it mean to be a "writer?"* 

Perhaps now that you can [buy my book instantly](http://bit.ly/Feebles), I am more qualified to answer this question - or, rather - a much more worthwhile one:

*What does it mean to be a "writer" in 2016?*

After receiving my precious copies of *Helicopter Man Pounds Dinosaur Billionaire Ass* and *Buttageddon: The Final Days of Pounding Ass* in the mail a week ago, I truly believe that I could answer with only "Chuck Tingle" and still remain the most correct individual in the known universe, but these works - despite their beauty-in-craft - will never top any contemporary news-crypt's best-seller list.

But why not?

Sharper anthropologists are out there, I'm sure, but I feel alone (with the huge exception of my best friend) in my doctrine of art consumption (along with my anti-food creed,) so I'm going to say with confidence on this privately-owned server of mine - in this dystopic medium - that most of them are probably idiots.
In the name of Variety (whose Holiness has not and cannot diminish,) I promised you [*Inmunis*](http://inmunis.co.uk) all that time ago, but I varied away too much to deliver. My mantras accumulate too quickly for my logistic capacity and I have been trying my best to manifest value in the process.

Here I am, though, writing The New Way.

Here it is, The New Website, and isn't it pretty? Surely, vanity is enough for the Ultimate Motivation.
Or, it would be, were it not for the overwhelming evidence against any present aspiration in my audience. In *any* audience, for that matter.
Surely, you must be worthy! Surely, there is one among you who craves what you've never seen before!
*You are strange? You listen to Surfjan Stan? At Walmart? Instead of going out on a Saturday night? Hm... Yes, surely there must be something worthwhile in the act itself!* 

It's common knowledge by now that adolescence is the appropriate period in one's life to insist upon his Growing Quirk.

Dear God, yes! My net worth grows every time I speak on *Breaking Boat*! There is real cash value in my unusual behavior, and I have only to wait until I can tell somebody to begin its liquidation!

Of course, I was not exempt from this. In fact, I am 22 years old, and the casual observer may conclude that I am still firmly rooted in it.

There's issue, though: any want in me for that ridiculous youthful varient of *individuality* faded away long ago. The rationalized elitism of my taste in music 
is ancient history. I can no longer believe myself *better* without 1) a sense of an objective standard of worth and 2) any money...at all.

I realized that it was the *breadth of the human spectrum* that so intrigued me, not my own oddities, and that the vast majority of its individual datapoints *must* dwell - voluntarily or not - very near the center. Without the gift of this truth from a Hecking Host of sciences and their givens, humanity would be wholly unviable.

But what if I told you that it is not by any reasonable measure a *widely-held* truth?
