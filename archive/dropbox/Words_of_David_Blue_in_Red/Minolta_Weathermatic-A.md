For the past few months, [Hawthorn](https://twitter.com/hawthorn_jr) has been unironically and unconceitedly introducing me into the World of Film photography. I’ve captured a lot of pictures in my lifetime, but almost exclusively in digital save for some pre-adolescent [experimenting](http://bit.ly/dbstylus) with a 35mm Olympus point-and-shoot, so let me disclaim this *review* as perhaps not the most useful to old time film nerds. For them, other resources like [*Forgotten Charm*](http://www.forgottencharm.com/minolta-weathermatic-a-110-pocket-camera/) or [Michael Butkus](http://www.butkus.org/chinon/minolta/minolta_weathermatic/minolta_weathematic-splash.htm) would better inform a buying decision or general research.

Kodak’s 110 Instamatic film format led to a surprisingly diverse variety of “pocket cameras,” and a great many of them are exceptionally beautiful examples of design. Despite its original, limited intended function, the industry pushed 110’s limits in the 1970s and 80s, from keychain [microcameras](https://www.lomography.com/magazine/90713-micro-110-key-chain-camera) - little more than an aperture mounted on the cartridges themselves - to [SLRs](https://blog.jimgrey.net/2012/10/05/minolta-110-zoom-slr/) with adjustable focus, exposure, and interchangeable lenses.

Minolta’s zooming Zoom SLR may have seemed an absurd pursuit to Jim Grey, but it sure looks great! Their later [Weathermatic-A](http://www.submin.com/110/collection/minolta110/), though, makes a bit more sense. It was introduced less than a decade after the cartridge’s birth - in 1980 - to fill a niche as yet tragically void in the lives of the four color-coordinated fun-lovers depicted on the underside of the original packaging’s lid. The names of the backpacker, rain enthusiast, surfer girl, and skiist have been lost to the decades, but their extraordinary enthusiasm for 110 photography - perhaps unmatched by any other individual for any other pursuit in history - has been forever immortalized. Clearly, this product - a water-tight-to-five-meters pocket camera wrapped in a buoyant, high-visibility jacket - was *the* missing key to their freedom and their purpose. (Seriously though… where are they?!)

Hawthorn had shown me its conventional cousins, and I’d been enchanted by the elegance of their compact, rectangular bodies and was consequently fated to adore the first bright-yellow little example we spotted on the shelf of an Oregon coast Goodwill for $7. It was obviously a working, well-worn camera - one of the plastic back cover release tabs had been broken, negating its potential for underwater photography. That didn’t bother me much, though - I haven’t been submerged in nearly 10 years. It’s very similar in function to the three-years-older Autopak 450E, but its two flimsyish top-mounted sliders for focus
