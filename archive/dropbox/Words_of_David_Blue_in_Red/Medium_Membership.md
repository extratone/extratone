# Medium Membership

[ ] A more honest alternative to “clapping” would be dropping change in a rusty tin.
[ ] Content is either on Medium for sheer convenience, or for Medium’s sake, only.
[ ] Too many of those blogs that still carry relevance are leaving Open Web sites for Medium.
[ ] A “resume” and/or bookmarking feature to keep one’s place when coming back to a post.
[ ] Dropcaps on mobile!

In much of the writing I’ve seen on Medium, there’s this terrible habit of beginning sentences with But or And. And it’s really not clever at all, although it’s [grammatically correct](https://blog.oxforddictionaries.com/2012/01/05/can-i-start-a-sentence-with-a-conjunction/), *technically*.

Paragraphs are broken much too early, for no discernible gain - I can’t imagine anybody I know who would find it desirable, and only a few would even call it *tolerable*.
