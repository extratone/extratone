# Dodge Caravan
The journey the MPV segment has taken in its thirty-year span is a lot more fascinating than you might assume. The early offerings were buttressed freaks of their 90s sedan counterparts, and therefore light, utilitarian, and – believe it or not – occasionally fun to drive. (Take the popularly-lauded, mid-engined Toyota Previa, for instance.) One with a particular eye might even call a few of them *beautiful*. However, the extreme bulbousing the industry as a whole has experienced across all segments in the 21st century in the name of *safety dearest* unfortunately missed not a one of them. The minimalist, high-value, cloth-upholstered middle class workhorses of the recent passed have been replaced with two and a half ton option-heavy, price-engorged motherfuckers.
