# Lacky Sleaze
squeeze your way through the bluffs,

as you go

stay your phantasms, scouting

chase them well down the weekday road
(just until you're sure you're dying in your sleep,)

stop for a shout; a beat
caught in the disingenuous mishmosh;
chucking the soul’s sodden peat
(its entirety)

and you'll find patches on an unrelieved blacktop band,
ensuingly;
spite throughout the abandoned land - 
the Decade of Negligence - 
(angry at me)

langoliers don’t discontinue their chasing
just seen - 
shit a quick wallop on 'ready-sparsing trees
(where are they going?)

unwelcome,
ubiquitous 
in every day’s 
boozy dusk, seizing
slime

forevermore to fuck something

moths: loose formations,
forlorn, smut rot,
flailing unawares into phosphorescents’ thoughts,
a by and by haunt

swipe their heat at the daintiest breeze
because a man’s life is short - 
his flout sticks wicked
in the craven jaunt

immovable, abashed; 
no better future than to dust his musk over the nesting crags,
crude

I'll be damned if that's how I go out -
dumb and prideless,
dripping dick doubt

it's a fuck lagoon, this town
standing water’s in the nightlife sounds

never short a dullard
*just hangin around*

another word,
and I’ll loam his way
sinners, floods;
levees cleanse plagues

an invisible camel conniption
staining the lampshade - the fume glacier

everyone in the world is trying to find my river

a relationship with their land

the more you need,
the more she loves you
