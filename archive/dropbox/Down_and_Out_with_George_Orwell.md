# Down and Out with George Orwell 
I have a bit of a tradition of only reading George Orwell when I’ve gotten myself in trouble. *Animal Farm* and *Nineteen Eighty-Four* were what I passed my time with throughout a particularly-sticky string of after-school detentions in High School. …For tardies, no less. I remember little bits of the later, but Animal Farm certainly wants for my revisitiation.
