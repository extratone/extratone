# A Dulled Edge | The Junction

*Are you doing okay? I hope so. Things are really bleak, right now, but we’re going to make it through this, and we’re going to come out having learned many profound things. I mean it.*

This past Friday was International Literacy Day, I’d ask you to join me for a moment to appreciate the gift of reading which we all take for granted in this communicative renaissance of ours, and reflect upon the fact that 1 out of every 5 human adults are still left in the dark.

Even under conditions of bizarre interpretation, we can surely all agree that **literacy is a human right**, and that its current predicament is **absolutely unacceptable** and **particularly dire** given the inherent cultural, economical, and *metaphysical* gulf between those who can read on a basic level, and those who cannot.

## Us

Our insincerity has been offputting for a few of you, lately, so I am taking this opportunity to sand the edges down, a bit. *(Aggregation as reparation?)* My own ‘[story](http://bit.ly/breederrick)’ about an anonymous [post](http://www.extratone.com/library/dontmovehere.html) on Portland’s Craigslist [in the room/share wanted section](https://portland.craigslist.org/mlt/sha/d/dont-move-here-native/6296723232.html) should at least provide a good laugh, I hope. For this moment, this day, and this work, though, we are going to be *nauseatingly* genuine.

**We are now taking submissions**. Sell it to us, or just hand it over because you love the way we look. Regardless, *get that work ‘a-comin*! 

Do you remember when it was *ultra-hilarious* and socially catalyzing to watch “BAD MOVIES” “”””IRONICALLY?”””” Well, if you’re like [*The Movie Closet*](http://bit.ly/moviecloset52) **crew, you might reflect upon them less painfully than you’d think. Since Anchor implemented their permanent episodes feature, we’ve been compiling and archiving our fullest radio days. [Here’s one](http://bit.ly/extrseptember6) from last week. Today’s is embedded below.


## Them

Holy shit, our cosmic mom can really do a [bizaare number](https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/3/16249478/total-solar-eclipse-lensrentals-pictures-camera-gear-wrecked-photography) on a digital camera! Also, *Atlas Obscura* found a [*Crazy Bug Man*](http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/bug-insect-public-relations-sociology) **intent on shaking up the *Bug Brand*, and *Bloomberg* [captured the aura](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2017-09-05/the-audacious-complicated-plan-to-move-a-swedish-mining-town) of Kiruna - Sweden’s Northernmost city - as the urgency of its planned **relocation** set in.

*The New Yorker*’s first-ever [TV issue](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/04) shall be framed and hung on my wall. Well, maybe not - but I’ll find a way to preserve it, somehow because it is a relic, already. Television was supposed to be making arrangements right about now, but its dementia finally found another body in the nick of time, and now all of our nights are spent compulsively pacing the White House.

“ "*In movie theatres, I sit in the dark and let worlds wash over me. Back in the light, I’m pulled toward screens inside of screens."*

Thanks to Comedian [Patton Oswalt](https://twitter.com/pattonoswalt) - with whom I share a birthday - we are [allowed along](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/04/the-poetic-work-of-trailer-recutters) for a middle-aged white man’s jaunt through the leading edge of Greater YouTube deviancy. That is to say - we are watching *Dad on YouTube*, and he likes *movies*. Keep him away from [YouTube Poop](http://bit.ly/drycast56), and everything will be just fine.   

◍ *“These isolated moments, though forever affixed into the larger machinery of the movie, stay with me, burn into me hotter than the movie itself. Every memorable movie has such moments.”*

◍ *"He is not disengaged from his material, but his sense of a subject, and his sense of an audience’s reaction to that subject, seem to be fused."*

Hunter S. Thompson’s timetable for the end of his life seemed just that bit more reasonable after stumbling out of *The New Yorker*’s [Ken Burns profile](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/04/ken-burns-american-canon), dripping apple syrup all over the shag. “The American Canon” left the reign of the Cowboy Intellectual long ago, and has subsisted for most of my lifetime under the spick and span direction of The Authoritarian Compulsion. (Care to take a gander at their apex; their ultimate masterpiece?)

◍ *”Children do endure in space and time, but they’re always changing, and no camera is sensitive enough to record the uncanny speed at which this transformation happens.”*

In one of the shorter, introspective, feature-dividing series called [*Screens*](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/screens), Karen Russell’s [reflection](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/04/the-addictive-insufficiency-of-baby-monitors) on the relationship between 21st century do-it-yourself, amateur home surveillance and the nuances of her maternal instinct was more beautifully profound - and horrifying - than just about anything else I’ve read recently.

◍ *“I left out the hugging and the e-mailing and the tick-tocking tiny penis, but, still, when I was finished he silently walked out of the room. I took a breath and held it. I had made a terrible mistake. Why had I done this? My mind stopped, poised to shatter.”*Another blue break - [Miranda July](https://twitter.com/Miranda_July)’s “The Metal Bowl,” on marriage, kinks, vanity, time, and performance.

◍ *"Facebook is the biggest surveillance-based enterprise in the history of mankind. It knows far, far more about you than the most intrusive government has ever known about its citizens."*

You could suggest it takes a [*Nieman*](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/09/factchecking-works-better-when-its-between-friends-then-again-who-wants-to-be-the-snoper/) to use the correct language for a discussion on Google, and ya wouldn’t sound crazy - the nonprofit, academic metamedia poise is a hell of a trip - but the *coolest* angle from which one critiques “Fake News” these days attacks on a past-parallel bearing, drawing some character and/or happening from the history of the Written Western Word to say *hey, wait a minute… this isn’t a new or pertinent accusation at all*. (It was probably myself who started this trend [over eighteen months ago](http://bit.ly/redpfaall).)

◍ *“The problem was not simply that people had been able to spread lies but that the digital platforms were set up in ways that made them especially potent.”*

Ya know, folks - you’re free to see *The New Yorker* [showing its age](https://twitter.com/adrjeffries/status/906341732211720193), but it’s in nothing but good taste. Writers like [Adrian Chen](https://twitter.com/AdrianChen) are invaluable counterweights to the island’s sinking. If meta is your ballast gauge, they’re [damned near thriving](https://www.newyorker.com/cartoon/a21211). Closing this doted-upon, all-American issue, “[The Fake News Fallacy](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/04/the-fake-news-fallacy)” is a suave weigh-in with all of the obligatory capitalizations and subtle lamentations, but the insight is there, too.

*“The proposed solutions to the fake-news problem typically resemble antivirus programs: their aim is to identify and quarantine all the dangerous nonfacts throughout the Web before they can infect their prospective hosts.”*

However - as Chen notes - the human brain isn’t really much like a computer, at all, though I’d have chosen a different allegory to attack: both software-bound and ideological viruses can be illicitly spread by email.

*“Turning to Big Data-driven algorithms to fix it will only further entrench our reliance on code to tell us what is important about the world—which is what led to the problem in the first place. Plus, it doesn’t sound very fun.”*

◍ *“It is often said that Trump has no real ideology, which is not true—****his ideology is white supremacy****, in all its truculent and sanctimonious power.”*

[Ta-Nehisi Coates](https://twitter.com/tanehisicoates)’ [essay](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/10/the-first-white-president-ta-nehisi-coates/537909/) about Tump’s Original Privilege in *The Atlantic* next month will surely be remembered as one of the greats of its kind from the Orange Potus era.

**It is simply** ***required reading****.*


    *To Trump, whiteness is neither notional nor symbolic but is the very core of his power. In this, Trump is not singular. But whereas his forebears carried whiteness like an ancestral talisman, Trump cracked the glowing amulet open, releasing its eldritch energies. The repercussions are striking: Trump is the first president to have served in no public capacity before ascending to his perch. But more telling, Trump is also the first president to have publicly affirmed that his daughter is a “piece of ass.”*

◍ “*It’s illegal to form a school district with the purpose of excluding people because of their race. Yet over the years, Jefferson County’s white residents have been allowed to carve out half a dozen exclusive enclaves.”*

Sadly, [*The Hechinger Report*](http://hechingerreport.org/how-the-federal-government-abandoned-the-brown-v-board-of-education-decision/)’s left me speechless. Unacceptable, obviously.

◍ *“Of the* [*eight news values*](https://www.poynter.org/2016/its-time-for-a-new-set-of-news-values-heres-where-we-should-start/418952/) *(proximity, timeliness, prominence, magnitude, conflict, oddity, impact, and emotion), emotion too often rises to the top when telling stories about disability communities.”*

Culturally, there are few conversations more important across the industry than disability, and [Wendy Lu](https://twitter.com/wendyluwrites)’s [suggestions for improvement](https://www.cjr.org/the_feature/journalism-disability-beat.php) via *The (New..new) Columbia Journalism Review* come from unique experience, and could/should be applied more universally to all types of reporting.

## Extra

Guess what I just discovered? [Discord](http://extratone.com/read) - bless its consistently-reshapen heart - has a limit of 50 pinned messages, still, so I’d like to revisit some of the best reads from the past 20 weeks of *The Tone*!

⌾ *“Lewis believes that objectivity has never actually been possible in journalism, and that newspapers’ insistence that they are “impartial observers”* [*has hurt their mission*](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/02/marketplace-doesnt-believe-in-the-view-from-nowhere-but-still-fired-a-reporter-over-a-blog-post/)*.”*

*NiemanLab*’s [interview](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/voice-of-san-diegos-what-we-stand-for-is-straightforward-and-a-bold-stance-against-objectivity/) with [Scott Lewis](https://twitter.com/vosdscott) - then-new EiC of the nonprofit [*Voice of San Diego*](http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/) *-* contained more reasoned editorial idealism than anything I’ve seen sense, frankly.


    *“We should all agree to better identify our own algorithms for how we figure out the news, and where we come from, and how we are funded, and be as honest as we can be. If a reader doesn’t want to listen to us after that, fine — we may have picked the wrong formula and not appeal to enough readers and therefore fall away."*

**⌾ *“There’s going to be some deep introspection and thinking about what are we making, what world are we making now, and how will we make it?”*

Of course… Another NL [profile](http://www.niemanlab.org/2016/08/newsonomics-sketching-in-the-details-of-josh-topolskys-new-outline/) on [Joshua Topolsky](https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky) and [*The Outline*](http://theoutline.com) when it was Just Wee. It’s more or less an inside joke, at this point, and weren’t those hard-banned in neo-new media? https://medium.com/@joshuatopolsky/your-media-business-will-not-be-saved-1b0716b5010c#.kqo8n7zbq
