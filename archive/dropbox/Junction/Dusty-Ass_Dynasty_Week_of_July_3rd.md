# All fire and smoke and nothing inside.
## Happy birthday to the most intellectually and economically disparate country on the planet. We hope the war simulation blew some demons back home.

◍ “*Would she be willing to close a long-standing mystery by confiding in a stranger, let alone 2,300 others? I feel strange, making the decision to reach out, but I'm a sucker for questions being answered.”*

[Isiah](http://extratone.com/heck)’s journey to join 1000 Steam groups led him to discover a [mystery](http://bit.ly/isiahhale) involving BDSM and a missing child.

◍ *“One of my friends confused* Pearl Harbor *with* Saving Private Ryan*.”*

[*The Movie Closet*](http://extratone.com/moviecloset) crew were especially profound, [this week](http://bit.ly/moviecloset44), operating under a prompt/theme of films that were adapted from books, inevitably leaving them under pressure from a few of *t h e  c l a s s i c s ,* which they handled admirably. Who knew Mikel Bass had so much to say about George Orwell? (I did, actually.)

◍ “*Streetwear is nearing 21st century equivalency with Dandyism - a subculture of men in the 1800s that dressed very flamboyantly - almost like Yankee doodle. Fucker wore a feather in his hat.”*

[Tim](http://extratone.com/cactus)’s authority on fashion is unbridled, and streetwear is undoubtedly a blindspot for the rest of us. In his [*How To*](http://bit.ly/marxwear), he offers us progressively less legal options to keep our heads above water, should we decide to buy our way into the game. 

# Them

Perhaps nothing under our newsletter’s **DIVISION** header has suited it more than a [vestigial poll on trust](https://www.axios.com/exclusive-astonishing-poll-about-trump-and-media-2453120782.html) which turned up the number **90%** - the portion of Republicans who “view President Trump as more trustworthy than CNN,” and **47%** - the # of poll participants who would describe Tump Tweets as “undignified.” 

You’re damned right.

◍ *“Trump is dead.”*
The dog, that is. 
(I’d try to fool ya, but Tump’s long past any entertainment value, whatsoever.)

*The New Yorker Radio Hour*’s [Steven Valentino](https://twitter.com/StevenValentino) and [Lizzie Widdicombe](https://twitter.com/widdikombe) bravely [traveled to Palm Beach](http://www.newyorker.com/podcast/the-new-yorker-radio-hour/my-night-at-mar-a-lago-and-jon-ronsons-kidnapped-pig), where Tump has already spent an inappropriate portion of his term holed up in Mar-a-Lago - the “new money” “palace” in which he can hide away, surrounding himself with cheap furniture, maniacal advisors, and idiotic dishes. 

◍ *“Trump is a man of the people as long as the people can cough up $200,000 a year.”*

After listening to some forty minutes of the hellhole’s sounds behind the episode, they’re left to play out for a moment, ending the story just after “…50 Tomahawk missiles,” and I feel sick. If your stomach is a bit stauncher, and you’re interested in the harder stuff, head to the *New Yorker* to hear about [Tump’s meeting with Putin](http://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/the-trump-putin-bromance-is-back-on).

◍ *“Close to 2 million people are incarcerated in the US today, and each episode of* [Ear Hustle](https://www.cjr.org/the_feature/ear-hustle-prison-podcast.php) *offers a unique glimpse into their lives, 30 minutes at a time.”*

Surely, it wasn’t all that hard to pitch a [podcast](https://www.earhustlesq.com/) to be recorded, edited, and produced in *San Quentin*. The [first episode](https://www.earhustlesq.com/listen/2017/6/14/episode-one-cellies-1) is a little rough, but surreal in a manner that’s bound to ensure some sort of listernship. I know I’ll be sticking along.

◍ *“Putting on a bathing suit, especially for women and femmes, can be like putting on a wearable microscope that forces you to zoom in on your own self-consciousness and doubt.”*

*The Outline*’s ability to so [confidently criticize](https://theoutline.com/post/1847/body-positive-advertising-swimsuits) neo-liberal cultural waves and illuminate their more detrimental consequences via such superb visual delivery is why we keep them around. There cannot be true liberation without de-commercialization.

Speaking of which, our Grandest Valley - “[the omnipresent moniker](https://www.wired.com/story/the-biggest-cliche-in-tech-is-hurting-cities/)” is probably the real Hell on Earth, [especially for women](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/technology/women-entrepreneurs-speak-out-sexual-harassment.html). Thanks to YouTube, it is still unabashedly democratized, though. 

**Hear**: [the sound of Lucifer’s waiting room](https://youtu.be/ExwXDcvH4go) and [the puzzling whisper of his demon’s monologue](https://youtu.be/cQeqqhgaJrc).

◍ *“It came from Nazis.”*

([lol](https://theoutline.com/post/1856/where-did-giant-novelty-checks-come-from-nazis)) + ([lmao](https://theoutline.com/post/1877/food-evolution-gmo-debate)) + ([holy fuck](http://thehardtimes.net/news/speed-metal-band-wired-explode-play-less-300bpm/))

◍ *“As part of the last generation to grow up without the internet, I am still not accustomed to the drastic ways search algorithms can direct people’s lives.”*

*Wired* didn’t do anything to fix their site after they absorbed *Backchannel*, which is a shame, but [this mystifying story](https://www.wired.com/story/search-algorithms-kept-me-from-my-sister-for-14-years/) about the search for a missing sister is a beautiful and chilling portrayal of algorithms’ profound effect on contemporary life, and well-worth breaking your browser tab.
