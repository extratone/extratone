# Fucking Sloshed, Dude

## From whence Kevin, The First came, and Tilda Swinton grocery shopped; where tires are burned, and golf is forgotten… THAT is where we shall meet our end.

We’ve no idea how to help this country, anymore, but we *do* know how to whip up a [mean email](http://bit.ly/thetone16), so we’re gonna… stick to that.

**If you’ve got 60 seconds to spare**, you could do us a big favor by comparing the [beta](http://bit.ly/peachtonept) of a freshened color palette (live on the [public test server](http://extratone.com/drakesville) until 10AM CST tomorrow) with the now year-old purples you’re seeing before voting how ya swing on [this poll](http://bit.ly/peachpoll) and/or sharing your feedback at any time in the *Hole* channel on our [Discord](http://bit.ly/extratone).

It may seem awfully petty, but you’d be surprised by the power a few months of a color one hex-row off can wield on your entire perception, though we’ve looked at the site *far* too much - all we need are a few fresh pairs of eyes to tell us how we’re doing.

◍ *“A wet, slimy, greasy chain would be harder to hold onto than a leather belt.”*
*The Office* was finally mentioned on [*The Movie Closet*](http://bit.ly/moviecloset47), and guess who it was that brought it up? (Or just go [see for yourself](http://bit.ly/moviecloset47yt) - *in Spanktravision*.)

◍ *“How blissfully ignorant those kayakers were, going about their paddling business, unaware of the hulking metal apparatus under their entombed lower body.”*

In [*The Truth About Kayaks*](http://bit.ly/kayaktruth), our own K.I. - Ace Prose Haunt of the North - recounted her harrowing recent experience with urban kayaking and her shocking encounter with a mysterious unknown entity called *The Gear*. (Rumor has it that she pounded out the entire piece in less than *25 minutes*.)

I don’t think I’ll ever be the same again, but it’s no matter because we celebrated ***two birthdays***: Leu Leu’s, with a [special frontpage](http://bit.ly/elebirt) containing all of her one-of-a-kind words, along with [Nina](https://twitter.com/isyallonline)’s, by revisiting our one-on-one [*Drycast*](http://bit.ly/ninterview) [interview](http://bit.ly/ninterview) from ages ago + a few of her [other podcast experiences](http://www.extratone.com/tag/nina/), over the years.

◍ *“Managerial liberalism is doing what any superego must under severe stress: continue, against all hope, to assert control.”*

The *Los Angeles Review of Books*’ [Emmett Rensin](https://twitter.com/emmettrensin) echoed his recent, well-titled essay, [*The Blathering Superego at the End of History*](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/the-blathering-superego-at-the-end-of-history/), with another seething front-page monologue for *The Outline* on the dire state of the left and the deepening trails of its hemorrhaging dignity as it struggles in mounting frustration to combat Tump on any ground, under virtually any terms.

◍ *"When the ghouls return… I am worried that the American left — already in a position more precarious than it cares to admit — will find itself in a fight far more difficult than the one it faces right now.”*

But the “darkening” of it all promises a purging, albeit tedious, thankless, and far from romantic.

**◍ *“It is only in this crisis that citizens raised in the heart of our empire have become the least bit amenable to radical solutions. It is only in this crisis that the dull centrists have let slip their total monopoly on the possible, and admitted that more radical solutions exist at all.”* 

The real war is on idiocy, then, and Tump - though still a centerpiece in its crest - is idiotic with more nuance than any of us could’ve seen coming.

◍ “*After 30 years of marriage, your high-school boyfriend might suddenly seem like a good option again.”*

If you’ve got a strong stomach for tasteless, inelegant drivel, I guess you can proceed to [this](http://nypost.com/2017/07/29/why-millennials-cheat-less-than-their-parents/) [*New York Post*](http://nypost.com/2017/07/29/why-millennials-cheat-less-than-their-parents/) [piece](http://nypost.com/2017/07/29/why-millennials-cheat-less-than-their-parents/) that vaguely orbits the topic of millennial adultery, [the excerpt](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/) from psychology professor Jean M. Twenge’s upcoming book found on *The Atlantic* is a vastly superior presentation of the authority’s data & individual conversations in her investigation of the smartphone’s cultural and developmental consequences.*

◍ *"Across a range of behaviors—drinking, dating, spending time unsupervised— 18-year-olds now act more like 15-year-olds used to, and 15-year-olds more like 13-year-olds.”*

Her findings are supportive in conclusions that nearly any observer - now regardless of demographic, essentially - wouldn’t be surprised to arrive upon in conjecture or silent judgement to such a degree that the language is altogether certain, bewildering, and devoid of exception. (Noted simply for the rarity of the instance.)

◍ *“Teens who spend more time than average on screen activities are more likely to be unhappy, and those who spend more time than average on nonscreen activities are more likely to be happy. There’s not a single exception. All screen activities are linked to less happiness, and all nonscreen activities are linked to more happiness.”*

What’s not commonly occurred to us all, I think, is just how overwhelming the technology critics’ majority is. The number of those younger technophiles (in the literal use of the term) who claim to wish osmosis with ‘the digital world’ who’d *actually* be down for a BMI or two is quite small, in my experience, and there’s still a plenty of natural, inescapable zest in even the least healthy childhoods - I never doubted that kids would begin to question the inevitable results of missed development, independent of science.

◍ *“I saw hopeful signs that kids themselves are beginning to link some of their troubles to their ever-present phone.”*

Yes, listen to me no more, but it’s an essential read - focus on the data and **really give it a chance**.

A [study in vulnerability](https://computerlab.io/2017/07/17/a-critique-of-vulnerability/) might prepare you for the [story](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/24/the-life-of-a-south-central-statistic) of Danielle Allen’s cousin and the price he had to pay for “three strikes.”

As for **Meta Media**, [*The Flood*](http://thefloodmag.com/)’s upcoming launch is particularly intriguing.

◍ *“An online publication that sits at the confluence of radical politics and rooted spirituality.”*

[*The War Horse*](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/08/after-blowing-the-lid-off-of-the-marines-united-scandal-the-war-horse-wants-to-improve-journalism-on-veterans-and-trauma/) doesn’t fuck around, the *Wall Street Journal* has certainly had [better quarters](https://www.cjr.org/criticism/politico-wsj-trump-transcript.php), but Patreon is gaining cultural momentum & relevance, finally - enough for a [nice big page-topping insider](https://www.patreon.com/posts/verge-does-13640130) with custom art on *The Verge*, at least, despite my *just now hearing* that its CEO, Jack Conte, *is the* Pomplamoose *guy???!!!!*

# Extra

⌾ As far as I’m concerned, [Nug’s photoshoot](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXV2hLAgibm/) is One Hundred Percent breaking, life-changing news. 

⌾ I saw *The Beguiled* in theaters and I’d recommend you enjoy “you hateful bitches” via [the trailer](https://youtu.be/iBoLK5z_FHo), and leave it at that - it’s just about the only valuable moment in the whole film.

⌾ If you enjoy reading early-morning Twitter rants regarding the perception of media in the general public and academia, for whatever reason, [have a go](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/894152496972804096).

⌾ It’s been brought to my attention that some of you still haven’t been exposed to [farming memes](https://www.facebook.com/AgricultureBanterPage/), but all meme imagery and similar content is barred from *Extratone* by our styleguide, so you’ll just have to trust the link. (You really should.)
