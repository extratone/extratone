## Us

◍ “Your *mid-30s soccer mom with a bob haircut that demands to speak to a manager at every establishment they walk in to regardless of whether or not they've been there before* attitude stops with me.”

When’s the last time you thought about Yelp!?!?!?

Astonishingly, the crowd-sourced food establishment review app still exists. More than likely, [Isiah’s Monday dissection of its current state](http://bit.ly/isiahyelp) is the first mention of it, anywhere, since 2008, yet they’re [still ridiculously stringent about the use of their brand](http://yelp.com/brand#logoUse). 

◍ *“Damn you people! This is golf!”*

[*The Movie Closet*](http://extratone.com/moviecloset) tackled the underdog trope for their [43rd episode](http://bit.ly/moviecloset43). How many tropes *are* there in film, anyway?!

◍ *“Just a lil’ tidbit - a taste.”*

Eryn, Madeline, and I finally [launched](http://bit.ly/rdadguns) our rural travel podcast.

It’s called [*Runnin’ Down a Dream*](http://extratone.com/dream), and - though I’ve “never guaranteed anything” - I can guarantee it’ll be *funny*, if nothing else.

◍ *“Please just make the toast.”’*

We found it prevalent to dig up a [*Drycast*](http://extratone.com/drycast) **legacy clip involving [gender, NASCAR, and sentient appliances](http://bit.ly/dry48clip).

## Them

◍ *“’Free will’ is just the biology we haven’t learned yet.”*

*Radiolab* [reapproached](http://www.radiolab.org/story/revising-fault-line/) a disturbing story recorded 4 years ago involving workplace romance, seizures, and child pornography. As Jad notes in their preface, the way we “blame” is a primary theme, but we find ***accountability*** to be a bit better-encompassing, and think “choice” should not be excluded.

“Free will” is awfully biblical, but perhaps not inaccurately, if one takes [David Foster Wallace’s word for it](https://medium.com/personal-growth/david-foster-wallace-how-to-create-a-life-of-meaning-and-awareness-d75920f5b4db). (Most will, I would imagine.)

◍ “*There is no such thing as not worshipping. Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship.”*

Yes, it’s a fluffy listicle, but DFW’s substance easily overrides the superficiality that usually defines the medium (and… Medium.) All five citations are incredibly profound.

◍ *“Everybody is identical in their secret unspoken belief that way deep down they are different from everyone else.”*

Get over that ASAP, would ya? It’s starting to have *very* serious geopolitical and climatological consequences, and we’ll never forgive you if it [costs us the culture of rural South](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/06/global-warming-american-south/532200/).

Speaking of which - cellular coverage is *still* a significant (and sometimes dangerous) issue for the antimetropolitans of America, but solutions appear to be underway. Matt Dunne - an “advisor” to the “small cell network provider,” CoverageCo - professed the woes & frustrations of a disconnected heartland in an [op-ed for](https://www.wired.com/story/rural-americas-future-is-riding-on-a-cell-signal/) [*WIRED*](https://www.wired.com/story/rural-americas-future-is-riding-on-a-cell-signal/)*.*

◍ *“As in other geographic and economic transition periods in our history, this rebalancing of economies across our country cannot be realized without communication infrastructure and the intentional use of resources to make it happen. Broadband and cell service are critical to ensuring we bring back economic balance across the geography of our nation.”*

We’ll spare you any discussion over [The Gif](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/881503147168071680), but would like to make it known to Tump, personally, that he is a weak, old man, and he’s welcome to *Extratone* fisticuffs at any time & place of his choosing to make it easy on us and the rest of the media industry.

A blow to the face is *much* less effort than a full Presidential term’s worth of coverage.

**On the metamedia side**, CJR’s *The Kicker* [took on “women’s publications”](https://www.cjr.org/podcast/podcast-whats-the-point-of-womens-publications.php) with Christie Chisholm and Meg Dalton, *The New York Times* [reported on](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/30/business/germany-facebook-google-twitter.html) a German law passed on Friday delivering specifics regarding how social media companies operating within the country respond to “illegal, racist or slanderous comments and posts,” and *The Outline* [noted](https://theoutline.com/post/1829/july-12-is-going-to-be-a-weird-day-on-the-internet) the confirmed & suspected participants in the upcoming digital media protest for net neutrality on July 12th.

Whew! 

Never a dull one, eh?
