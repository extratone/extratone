# Mind of Marx Intro
I’m going to give the best explanation of the writings that will be known as *The Mind of Marx* in the best sorts I can, as nothing in these volumes is written of sound and sober mind.

----------

I have found myself writing in my notebook just as I’m falling asleep, drunk or intoxicated in other ways I won’t explain for my own security. 

In bed, I often find myself with what seem at the time to be good ideas. Then, I will ask myself *why does my creativity only strike me when my head has struck the pillow?*

I really don’t know.

So I will lay there, with a pen sitting in my ashtray and a journal at the base of my deskside lamp, and write down my thoughts. It’s somewhat troubling, though: if I encourage myself to pick up that pen, I become compelled to write without sleeping.

*Is this how Blue feels every night?,* I think to myself. I pray for rest in that man’s soul. It’s no wonder his mind is never at peace.

I guess I write these in the hope that they will calm my spirit and my mind. This never happens, though, and the result is *The Mind of Marx*.

These works will document my true thoughts, stripped of all inhibitions and cares.

I hope they will help other people in some sort of way.
