# Caffeine Addiction 101

## So, you’re new to the world renowned drug known as *caffeine*. Look no further - Mr. Marx is here to guide you.

Let’s get the first - and probably most important rule out of the way: coffee.

Coffee is the only substance of choice for indulging in caffeine. All other options kare bullshit methods of ingestion, and should not be relied upon under any circumstance save for a *real need* of a fix. This is a simple rule, and it needn’t further explanation.

Rule two: coffee to be had black. Cream and sugar are for the weak. If you *must* spice up your coffee, I would highly suggest whisk(e)y.

Once you’ve mastered these two, you’re on your way to an *elite addiction.* As with most of these, caffeine is like a country club - it will take much more from you than it will eventually give back.

Caffeine will - no matter your race or creed - cause you need to shit furiously until you’ve adapted to it, and *significantly* increase the intensity of your urges to urinate. I can’t tell you how long this’ll last, or if the side effects will *ever* go away. I think that people just become used to them, though you *can* counteract their severity but increasing your daily water intake.

Now that you are a caffeine addict, you’ll need to tackle what any good addict of any drug does: snobbery prevention.

Nobody likes a weed snob, and the same goes for a coffee snob. Find yourself a simple brew you like, and stick to it. Nothing crazy. 

Get a cup - and only a *basic coffee cup*. Don’t be flashy. Six foot bongs are stupid, and so are high-end mugs. A good alcoholic sticks to something simple, and so should you.

Caffeine addiction is a double-edged sword, but that doesn’t mean you have to get cut by it. Follow these rules, and you will be fine.

Or don’t… this is only a rant of The Mad Mind of Marx.
