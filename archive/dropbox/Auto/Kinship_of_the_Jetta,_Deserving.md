# Kinship of the Jetta, Deserving

## In my newfound humility, I bear the marque of the common man, but is it a punishment?

I had the privilege of  spending nearly a year with a 2014 Volkswagen Jetta TDI Sportwagen through a brief period of two-hour, both way commuting, a half-year (quite interesting) stint in ridesharing, and my usual country road-bombing shenanigans. In acquiring it, my plan - and it was a good plan - was to cease an era of general insensibility in my life's decisions by entombing my wayward self within the most sensible expression of modern automotive design I suspected I could live with. According to [a Tweet](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/261163556073005056) from October, 2012 (which I did not consciously remember at the time of purchase,) I had long considered Jetta Wagon ownership. The wagon component, then, was long established, but some casual research added diesel power and manual transmission. Diesel, manual, wagon - of the people's car, these I sought. Nay, *demanded*.

American car buyers do not like diesels, wagons, or manual transmissions. Folks like me seem to have [quite an affinity](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/20/automobiles/autoreviews/diesel-wagon-whatll-they-think-of-next.html) for all of these, so a culmination of all three into a single product should be very desirable, in theory.


> Auto writers have long tooted the horn about the benefits of diesel engines, and a bunch of them have also argued that the old-school station wagon is a far more efficient way to haul things around than a bloated high-set S.U.V.

Surprisingly, I only needed to pass up a single option in the Kansas City area before I found The One: a 2014 post-[Dieselgate](https://youtu.be/SvokGhOaHGg) example with ~65,000 miles on its odometer, which had been previously owned only by a single Michigan cyclist. My salesman Charles likely noted that my friend, girlfriend, and I were (and are) entirely unafraid of facing The End when a very near collision during our test drive did not perturb us in the least, but left him huffing and puffing from adrenaline. He was a star, though, throughout the more than four hours of deliberations required for his institution to reckon with my credit history. Eventually, I ended up spending almost exactly $12,000, which was probably too much, and named my new automobile Martin - "Marty" for short - after Martin Winterkorn, the former CEO of Volkswagen AG who [bore more than his share of the blame](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/ex-vw-ceo-winterkorn-charged-by-u-s-in-diesel-cheating-case) for Dieselgate, including [charges of fraud](https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/16/18369528/vw-ceo-martin-winterkorn-dieselgate-germany-volkswagen-emissions-scandal) by the German government. *Dirty diesel rolling coal in prison*.

By "post-Dieselgate," I mean that my new car was a part of [Volkwagen's $10 billion buyback program](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15344947/whats-volkswagen-doing-with-all-those-repurchased-diesels/), so the Michigander sold it back to the manufacturer for its "fair replacement value" - [between $12,500 and $44,000](https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a15347930/volkswagen-settles-diesel-emissions-violations-for-14-7-billion-even-more-fines-to-come/) according to *Car & Driver* on behalf of FTC chairwoman Edith Ramirez.
