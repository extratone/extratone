Something about 2015 felt like the late-90s in many ways - like we had almost learned to have unapologetic, carefree, simple fun again. *Furious 7*, like the rest of the predating *Fast* series before it, is completely exempt from pretense. It’s hilarious that we judge films like these against those like *LaLa Land* in the same context - the same Academies, and the same theaters because they perform completely different functions.
