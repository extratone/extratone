I am no [Dave Pell](http://nextdraft.com) - I have mostly abstained from the [Email Toke](https://twitter.com/davepell/status/867596628470792192) - but I thought I’d include some hyperlink-flooded accompanying remarks to [this week’s newsletter](http://bit.ly/thetone8) this time to give you a bit more to chew on.

It seems like *The Verge*’s Megan Farokhmanesh was the perfect writer for a [front-page feature](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/6/15675884/useless-web-internet-viral) on the sillier bits of the World Wide Web. What I found using Tim Holman’s [The Useless Web](http://www.theuselessweb.com/) spurred nostalgia for a time when my friends and I spent *way* too much time on “Web 1.0,” a very *very* different place. I found [this random error generator](http://www.randomerror.com/), which is much too entertaining, and learned that there are *29 seasons* of *Cops* thanks to [this utility](http://tiii.me).

([This bit about Ravens](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/9/15768336/raven-grudge-fairness-social-hierarchy-animal-behavior) also made the front page, which is a good reason to continue checking it at all.)

Since *The Nieman Lab*’s [feature](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/from-coal-to-broadband-to-trumps-budget-the-daily-yonder-reports-on-rural-life-for-the-people-actually-living-it/) on *The Daily Yonder*, I’ve been reading it frequently. You’d be surprised how many gaps it fills that you didn’t know you had. A Sunday drive as a means of “[celebrating changing rural life](http://www.dailyyonder.com/sunday-drive-encourage-small-town-exploration/2017/06/08/19180/)” is one of those arguments only they can make.

*The Outline*’s big photo features are consistently captivating, and [this one](https://theoutline.com/post/1666/an-american-flag-grows-in-cuba) focusing on imagery of the American flag in Cuba is no exception.

Living amongst the middle-class, gentrification is the often the most (or, first) obvious form of **DIVISION**, so it’s surprising that the television network HGTV is not cited/examined more often in the context of class criticism. 

“[Like venture capitalism and finding a romantic partner, many people learn about home ownership from television and one especially popular channel in particular: HGTV](https://theoutline.com/post/1655/hgtv-displacement-gentrification).”

Somehow, plenty of for-profit sports teams still have very racist mascots. Right now, a [bill is being proposed](https://theoutline.com/post/1690/native-american-mascots-banned-massachusettes-public-schools) in Massachusetts that could [result](http://www.masslive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/06/state_rep_calls_native_america.html) in 37 schools under legal obligation to change their branding, if it passes.

Open Culture’s [heads-up](http://www.openculture.com/2016/06/download-336-issues-of-the-avant-garde-magazine-the-storm.html) regarding the newly-available *Der Sturm* archive is interesting, but their actual download links are always unnecessarily hidden, [so I made you one](http://bit.ly/dersturmdl).

*Backchannel* is moving. “[Now we’ll be hosted on Wired’s site, rather than on Medium](https://backchannel.com/backchannel-is-moving-to-wired-dcb693c26ac0).” Unless *Wired* implements some serious fixes to its web presence, this is nothing more than a move from a *bad* CMS to a *broken* one.

**In meta news**, our [new masthead](http://extratone.com/masthead) is live, and we’ve found a sufficient auxiliary beat in [tractor blogging](http://antiquetractorblog.com/2015/05/25/why-i-love-the-8n-ford/) to finally get some good sleep.
