# Shin G is Kay | Zovi
The figure in the straw hat was last seen five weeks ago by a certain citizen names Agnes Borgues. Ms. Borgues suggested that the figure was over six feet tall and was carrying a black briefcase. She said that he appeared in the bushes outside of her home in the Sangarock Trailer Park off of Route 29 and immediately walked due north. The sunset followed him. She reported further that just before disappearing into another thicket of bushes, the suitcase told her a coded message using methods that may be considered telepathic in nature. The message, transcribed after great difficulty, phonetically amounted to the enigmatic phrase "SHIN G. IS KAY." Investigators are currently on the case to find this "Shin G." Public records show one Geri Shin from nearby Sloatsbrook, but Ms. Shin refused to comment despite repeated phonecalls, knocking on her door, and throwing a brick through her bathroom window. The meaning of the "IS KAY" part of the message is as of yet unexplained. Ms. Borgues has been taken into an unidentified location for question from authorities beyond our understanding. We will have more on this story as it develops, or when we obtain high enough clearance.
