# Facebook Exceeding Limits of Usability

## *The Mammoth Net Menace*

Without stats on use, lets assume that the vast majority of Facebook accounts are dormant — everybody’s either dead, or using the service as a sort of address book for old friends and acquaintances. I think this is its most reasonable and unique function by far, and it obviously warrants millions to keep an account.

Assuming the majority of the millions are mostly ignorant regarding their smartphone’s data/resource usage, just imagine how much heat is being created by totally irrelevant background processes. Imagine the potential drag on our infrastructure Facebook could be responsible for.

Unlike sane app developers, Facebook’s codemonkeys are required to come up with a new release every week. I can’t even begin to impart the scale of the consequences of such misincentive.
