# THIS IS AUGUSTUS

We're committed to our mission of delivering one-of-a-kind features and podcasts in a uniquely compelling package, free of belittling pollutants like paywalls and advertising. Unfortunately - like all great causes - ours requires sacrifice.

We’ve discussed internally how we could maximize value to those who decide to support our publication with their hard-earned cash, each month. We knew we wanted our first “pledge drive” to be something powerful and unique - like nothing anybody’s ever done before. We thought about what motivated our readership - what could we add to make subscribing a rewarding experience? Obviously, the knowledge that one has supported the future of independent media hasn’t been cutting it.

Eventually, we decided it’d be a sure bet to threaten the greatest pioneering content of the circus web: *pets!*

Gus (short for Augustus) is a twelve-year old purebred Cocker Spaniel who's life has soured a bit from old age. He’s lost most of his hearing and his vision’s not what it used to be thanks to some very large cataracts. He spends his alone time pitifully waiting for his owners to come back, but performs little function for them - his companionship is fickle, and heavily-dependent on the prospects of a meal. Despite constant criticism from those who know him, we do not believe he deserves to be killed in front of the people he loves.

If you agree, and would like to be part of our effort to save him, please consider the [subscriber tiers](http://extratone.com/sub) on our Patreon. 

We are not merciless: even the entry “Visitant” level will count as one of the FIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS NEEDED before tomorrow morning, (August 12th) at 1:45AM Central Standard Time.

Regular updates will be posted on [Twitter](http://Twitter.com/extratone) and [Facebook](http://Facebook.com/extratonemag). 

Make the right decision and spread the word - help keep this poor pup alive.
