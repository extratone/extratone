# Essentials Tweets

Earlier this week, Twitter [added a new “share” button](https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/product/2018/an-easier-way-to-save-and-share-tweets.html) with consolidated functionality and the ability to bookmark Tweets. For those two human beings in the world who are enthralled about this revelation (and not at all in the spirit of throwing a cheap, gutless post in the fray for the sake of doing it) we thought we would revisit the 12-year-long history of the platform - it being old hat for us and all - to pick out a few of the Best Tweets to begin filling your bookmarks with. (I am “celebrating” my 10th year using Twitter at least once every… single… day.)

Inevitably, many are from [Martha Stewart](https://twitter.com/MarthaStewart) or [Cher](https://twitter.com/cher) - and perhaps you’ll have seen and engaged with a few of them in the past - but hopefully, at least one or two of the Tweets below will truly add something substantial to your life. Naturally, if you know of a handy Tweet you feel has been left out, please use that new button and [DM them to us](http://twitter.com/extratone). (Of course they’re open! Who did you think we were?)
