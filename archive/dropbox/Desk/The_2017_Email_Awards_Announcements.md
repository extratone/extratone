# WORSHIP THE EMAIL
## To find this year's most perfect electronic mail message.

For thousands of years, man has used electronic mail to intercommunicate, woo, build communities, topple businesses & civilizations, embezzle money, spread worms, distribute cluttered, broken links to discontinued Orscheln products, feed infants, set climate control, confirm identities, check bank account statuses, and lie to exhausted, slightly-conceited, and *newly self-published* professors. That's right - These Trillions of simple digijewels have (insecurely, for the most part) purveyed *every single possible category of human communication*, and it's still growing strong.

In fact, this trusty ole' protocol of ours has been almost bizarrely present in headlines these past twelve months - search our [reading list](http://extratone.com/read) for "email" and you'll quickly turn up words from [Walt Mossberg](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/29/15101458/mossberg-youve-still-got-mail-snapchat), *The Nieman Lab's* [Laura Hazard Owen](http://www.niemanlab.org/2017/03/this-email-newsletter-raised-300k-from-its-affluent-largely-silicon-valley-based-readers-in-55-hours/), and [Jason Calacanis](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/30/15114224/jason-calacanis-inside-email-social-media-news-journalism-facebook-google-recode-podcast) with *Recode*'s indelible Peter Kafka - and that's just the recent meta stuff!
 
Of course, Secretary Clinton's name became forever associated with emails in the American psyche thanks to to [Email Scandal Supreme](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/the-new-york-times-clinton-email-controversy-timeline), and the thorough, academic parsing of archives released because of other oopsies has even [lent insight](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/07/24/what-the-enron-e-mails-say-about-us) into the nuances of the way we work, while *I* have been howling my evangelism for a *Cool Email Future* for months.

Suffice it to say… **we love email** and rely on it internally and externally to platform the exploration of a *Better Future* for digital media, and - though we enjoy [The Email Newsletter Webby](https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/2016/websites/general-website/email-newsletters/) - we’ve wanted to host our own annual contest to determine *the best single email message* of the year, and have begun preparations for our first event to be held just a week or two into next year.

Right now, things are casual - we’ve begun taking submissions via [**this Google doc**](http://bit.ly/niceemail) (which you can find again/recommend to a friend using bit.ly/niceemail and/or extratone.com/nice.) Your participation in this contest is anticipated and easy! 

**There are just two restrictions** on your (as of yet, unlimited # of) submissions.
Submissions must be messages (direct link to online version, forwarded message to horn@extratone.com, or by screenshot including sender and receiver information posted and marked in our [Discord](http://bit.ly/extratone)) that were **originally received by an email account in the submittor’s possession**.
Submitted emails must have been **sent** ***and*** **received within the 2017 calendar year**.

Categories, criteria, and possible physical awards shall be determined as we go, but for now - **please submit an email if you find it at all noteworthy**. If the volume of submissions should become unmanageable, we’ll let you know, and we’ll have more details coming as the end of the year draws near.
