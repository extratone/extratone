# Dropbox Paper Review
Dropbox Paper is the most profound single productivity tool I’ve ever added to my life. It’s so incredibly rare to encounter software to which I would not recommend a single change! I’d managed to integrate it so seamlessly into my daily work since its launch that it hadn’t occurred to me for far too long to write a review.

I can’t stand clutter or Google properties, and Evernote has been showing its age for years, so I was extremely excited when Dropbox Paper was announced. I’ve used it heavily and almost daily since its release in both my writing job and elsewhere. You would not believe how handy it is to have a clean, smooth, and live-synced word entry space so close at hand. I don’t see much reason to complain about what it *can’t* do considering that the alternative clumsy, feature-pumped legacy notetaking services will always be available should you need them, but you won’t.

I can only hope that Dropbox won’t feel the need to add more features.
