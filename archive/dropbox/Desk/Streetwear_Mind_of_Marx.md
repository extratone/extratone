# Streetwear | Mind of Marx

# I am now three weeks deep into a Berlin techno binge and an endeavor to up my fashion game.
## (The two are not related in any way.)

I’d like to say that I’ve always dressed myself nice as an adult. (David boasts about me very often on our outings.)
 
With that stated, I still found this unwavering need to increase my fashion sense and dress better, and not by just suiting up constantly like that fuck in that shit television show... *How I Met Your Mother.*
 
I'm surely going to catch flack for that statement, but I don't often find myself caring about the feelings of those who enjoy laugh tracks.

So if I wasn't going to dress up in a three piece every day and look like a super pretentious dick when I left my home, what could I do? I had honestly been pondering this question about my ears for sometime, until one day, I finally saw a top post from [/r/streetwear](https://www.reddit.com/r/streetwear/).* 

**Yes, I do browse Reddit, which is not reflective of the rest of our editorial staff.*

I was instantly entranced with a new subculture of well-dressed men and women that immediately looked great. A tribe.

## Now for a drunken comparison of Dandyism and streetwear.

 
Streetwear is nearing 21st century equivalency with Dandyism - a subculture of men in the 1800s that dressed very flamboyantly - almost like Yankee doodle. Fucker wore a feather in his hat.

Dandys would have public competitions to see who could redress in the greatest outrageous, yet fashionable garb the most in a single day. For the truest and wealthiest among them, it became a lifestyle - the handmade clothing, dyes, and materials all of the finest caliber (and expensive as hell, I’d imagine.) In that sense, the two have a lot in common.

*(If that didn’t make sense, don’t worry about it - I was drunk.)*

A better explanation: in its rawest form, streetwear is simply small-time indie skateboard clothing from the 1990s turned high-fashion. Since, it’s absorbed other substyles like techwear, but we’ll come back to that.

Streetwear suppliers have metamorphosed into luxury brands because their products have become virtually unattainable to the commoner, and people *will* pay A Shit Load for t-shirts from resellers with a small red box logo. Seriously, *fuck the stock market* - reselling streetwear is a better hustle.

Kanye West’s “Yeezy” brand sold completely out at launch for a reasonable $220 - and that’s still two big ones, but it’s doable for a lot of us if we save up for a bit.

Now… say you couldn’t cuff a pair from a retailer on day one. Well boi/gal… **you are fucked**. $1200 is considered a bargain on some pairs, buying on the net or resale stores.

If you’ve got the startup capital and the time to scalp people on streetwear clothing, **it is highly recommended**. My buddy has a friend who once dealt drugs with some notoriety, but switched to streetwear resale, a few years ago, and now nets higher gains than ever.

Some readers may find this upsetting, as will manufacturers, considering their origins in DIY skateboarding. They’d prefer *normal*, law-abiding, *skateboarding* customers, who often find retail prices unaffordably steep. In the past, companies have openly discouraged resale, yet the apparent simple fix would be to increase their number of products sold. Theoretically, their exclusivity would suffer negative consequences, though.

Kanye West has [spoken out](https://www.aiobot.com/kanye-west-says-yeezy-sneakers-will-available/) on the topic, and intended to up the release quantity of Yeezy V2s, but something ran amok in the factories, likely sustaining their scarcity until later this year. At least Yeezus tried.

Should you find yourself *desperate* for a pair or two, there are alternatives to a $1200 wait. You could always partake in the evil underbelly of fashion: *bootlegging.*

The issue is very much like a two-party American political debate. Both sides - for, or a against it - duke it out on forums and social media. The most detrimental effect of the practice is in the distribution of revenue, which flows in unknown portions into the sex trade by way of child labor. While it could be a legitimate accusation, we all know that taking the veil off of companies like **[REDACTD,]** **[REDACTD,]** or **[REDACTD,]** would reveal less-than-pious factory conditions, so looking down at individuals wearing bootlegged apparel from a moral high ground makes you look like an ass.

On the other hand, denial in the interest of looking cool on the part of the wearer in such situations relegates him/her to *piece of shit* status, too. I own a pair of “UA” (unauthorized) Yeezys, and I’ll tell the truth if I’m asked in person, though the Midwest culture seems to be relatively apathetic about fashion authenticity.

Missouri Grandmothers don’t care about anyone’s shoes, unless they make you look like a stripper.

I don’t feel bad about my money going to some shadey factory - sorry Kanye, you’re not getting $200 from me, today. I’m okay with diverting my investment away from you or Addidas - I think you’ll all be just fine without my financial support.

Technically, **there is a third and final option**. Find cheap, unbranded clothing on the internet that looks like something expensive, and rock it. Perhaps even get yourself a screen printing press and make your own shit. (I’ve been thinking about this for *Extratone*.) The only drawback: you won’t be flexing a $3000 outfit, and some people on the internet will say mean things. Then again, they’ll always say mean things, and there’s no reason to listen to them if *you* think you look good. 

Unless you’re wearing socks with sandals and cargo shorts… Then, you’re in need of some deep self-reflection.
