# Return of Munch
Dear  fans,

Like many of you I was really,really pissed off by what they just did to me.
How they treated The Dark Chet Munch was absolutely unforgivable.
I thought it was a joke at first, a dream sequence. But no, they actually did it. They actually did THAT to The Dark Chet Munch. I was absolutely outraged.I wanted to go bazerka and kill all the writers.Rip their hearts out and force them to eat it in the name of The Dark Chet Munch. How could they do that? The Dark Chet Munch is one of the most beloved characters of all time. He should NOT be treated like that.
I have thus written a story about how they should be treated. A proper example of writing and respecting The Dark Chet Munch!

Meanwhile, Chet Munchs mind was wondered back to the past. The good old days....
It was S holy communion party, which everyone was invited too.
The party was awesome as always, because Satan was hosting it.

Chet Munch was pretty drunk that day. He had already punched a bunch of people. The Sun a few times.Because She is stupid.Blood was spilled. But that was normal in this sort of party.As was the pile of bodies.
If Chet Munch was honest, He couldn't remember much that happened. 
Only something about a lycanthrope,a goat and a pair of scissors.

There was one thing that stuck in Him mind though. Something He would never forget.
Chet Munch.
Chet Munch was wearing a The Dark Chet Munch mask that night (it was a fancy dress party btw - A/N).
It was one of the most erotic costumes at the party.
Everyone had come as something or someone else.
No one could recognize anyone else because everyone had bits of their bodies covered;

THE DARK CHET MUNCH WAS DRESSed as THE SUN.
THE SUN WAS DRESSed as .
 WAS DRESSed as God.
God was dressed as Satan.
And Satan was dressed as a sussage.

Chet Munch had no idea which person Chet Munch was! At the top they were strangers. But they would become much more!
Chet Munch was instantly attracted to Chet Munch in Him costume. The way He moved. The way He talked.The way He flicked His hair.
Chet Munch was doing a Karaoke number. 
It was "wannabe". And He was awesome.
He sung like they were possessed.The audience was transfixated by Chet Munch. 
Underwear was chucked at Chet Munch.
Chet Munch was soooo turned on.
(and He didn't need that underwear anyway)
Despite His crushing shyness,and fear of people judging him,Chet Munch got up and sang too.
When Chet Munch was singing wannabe it was like the words spoke to Him. Chet Munch seemed to be addressing each word of the song just to Him. The room faded away and it was just the two of them. No one else in the world.
They gazed into eachother eyes as Chet Munch put His soul into the last lyric.
Then silence.

Suddenly, Chet Munch was woken out of the flashback by current events!

Far far away, in a magical far away distant land..

The next time they saw eachother Chet Munch winked at Chet Munch, remembering what happened at the party.Chet Munch blushed.
Some of the others giggled. Did they know? Chet Munch didn't care.

I'm sooo sorry for not updating! I'm working really hard on some other cool stories (but I can't tell you about that in case holywood wants to steal my ideas. It's *that* good!

As usually, the fandom characters aren't mine, but everything else is! That includes the unique VERSION of the fandom characters seen in this story.

Enjoy!

Summary:
I suck at writing summaries. Bsides the 'fic isn't that long!

I am God.

I was sitting behind my desk. I felt the tears well up in my eyes . After Our last adventure, I found out just exactly how cruel people could be. How nasty and inconsiderate real humans actually were. I stared at a picture of a polar bear. A magnificent beast who would not hesitate to kill me ripping him limb from limb, but at least it would be quick. Not a overlong conspiracy of many years, just to be unleashed on me when I was at my weakest and darkest moment. When I needed my friends the most.

But there had been one tiny ray of light in this whole . I remembered fondly the day I discovered it. It was a tuesday morning I rememberanced. The memories surfaced before my mind's eye and took the most wonderful shapes. Before I well knew it, a single tear welled up in my eyes and trickled down my cheek.
Because even when all my 'friends' betrayed me there was one consistant factor in my life: Satan.

And I knew that the rising aspirations between them could never become true, the feelings I had for Satan were the only thing in this world that still felt true to him. No lies, just that single, pure sense and feeling for Satan.Our relationship would probably only ever be physical.

Alas, I thought to meself hopelessly. Why must they battle? Why must I be destined to destroy Satan? Can I ever tell Satan how much Satan means to me?

If only I could. Then all my pain would be over. No more betrayal. No more suffering under the laughter from The Sun (who told him she loved me, only to stab me right inti the heart at valentines day!). No, only Satan and my true feelings for Him. 

A/N Lol this has all been so depressive lol! My next bit will be less dark!

A/N I got bord of writing the fanfic as it was so I decided to change things around. I hope u guys like it!!

I was as of yet the most beautifyl thingy in the whole of Hell, God believed me to be. As I faigjt the great villianness Satan, my Big boppers bobbed up and down consistantly like someone making love in a car. I swipped sexlyat the Satan and was more than anything God had seen before. My beatiful feistful pressure shocked Satan's henchmen into copulating before me. 

The Dark Chet Munch, take my sword! said God, and give it to the greatness before us. She will need our legendary sword in order to defeat the great uber-Satan"

And lo! The Dark Chet Munch did so and the maginificent great mysterious woman that was me took the sword and I stabbed Satan.

He was defeated. But was Satan? Because as God ran towards me (I was the mysterious strange beauty of their draems) and was about to share the greatest kiss they(and more) had ever given to someomne in the history of mankind, Satan rose up and fled!

Chet Munch had some time before he had to do anything, so He decided to have another flashback.

It was just after the Karaoke. They had stepped of the stage to loud applause and were now looking at eachother.
"Hi" Chet Munch said, meekly.
"Hay" Chet Munch said, also meekly. Their confidence from moments ago had evaporated like alcohol.
"Do you want too..."
"maybe.."
"ok then."
So they walked to the cloakroom.
It wasn't long before their lips were together. Chet Munch couldn't remember who made the first move. 
He did remember the taste though. The taste of Chet Munch.
Chet Munch tasted like cherimoya on a summer noon.
Refreshing and salty but also a bit sour.
What had they been eating? Chet Munch tried to work out it. It took much tung work.
After a few minutes mouth to mouth pot holing, Chet Munch guessed what Chet Munch was doing. 
"I had physalis for lunch."
"oh"
"you dont have to stop though"
"oh. Good!" Chet Munch said, with great relief.
They finally drew away after what seemed a whole century but was only mere minutes. 
The taste of Chet Munch's lips (and other things) still lingered in Chet Munch's mouth as they finally looked upon each other with new eyes.
Relieved sighs came from both of them as both embraced, Chet Munch snuggling against Chet Munch's neck as he snuggled upto Chet Munch's torso.



Chet Munch went further by clutching Chet Munch with his fingers, pulling at the fabric of His slacks to feel what was underneath.

The telltale shape in His leggings stood out between them, especially with the weight it had against Chet Munch's thigh.

Chet Munch moved over Chet Munch's body like a serpent and lovenly nuzzled at a peaked abbs.
Chet Munch liked this a lot and started making a lot of noise. Chet Munch joined in. "Owwww...Ahhh...MAHAhhhEEkkk...aakk"
It got pretty noisy from that point on. Both of them had a lot of fun and made a lot of noise!. Chet Munch sounded like Bi-plane ! Chet Munch sounded like a heard of Cetaceanss on drugs. They had a lot of..."fun".
"My groinal area are hurting...can we stop? 12 times is enough surely?" Chet Munch said, pleading.
"No...MORE MORE MORE" said Chet Munch, with apparently an insatiable apatite
Chet Munch finally head butted Chet Munch to get Him to stop.
"Sorry about that, I got a little carried away" said Chet Munch.
"Thats ok I.....enjoyed it." said Chet Munch blushing in the way they always did.
"Tomorrow?"
"Yes" said Chet Munch.
"I'll bring some of my toys next time for us to play with" said Chet Munch.

And with that they left the cloakroom and returned to the party. The months that followed were fun but eventually they broke up and became enemies.

So we defeated Satan and everyone was satisfied!

Satan: what do you mean, it's not over yet?! I'm invincible!
Me (The Dark Chet Munch): No No, back into your coffin!
Satan: Grrrr. You will never get me in my box. I am too large and too sexy!my skin flute wont fit!
Author: Ohh no, it looks like the characters still want a story!
Me: of course we do! Or cake. I love cake!
Satan: Well I'm gonna steal your cake!
Me: Noooo! Whats going to be my dinner now!?
Satan: mhuahahaha, life isn't worht living without caaaaaaaaake, so just die already will you?!
Me: OK, Ur right, life isn't worth living without the awesomeness of cake. Farewell bitter world of cakelessness!
The Dark Chet Munch: chotto mate-ah!
Satan: huh ;^_^; 
The Sun: domo desu-ka @_@?
Me: Caaaaaake, need cake. Like brains, but cake!
The Dark Chet Munch: well, I want you, how about that? 
The Dark Chet Munch winked at me, but I wasn't into that sort of shit.
But The Sun was all hot 'n that, I thought. So 
I Left the fanfic and looked for a nice bed to crawl into together and maybe more Me: Oh definitely more, I'm going to rip your clothes off and plunge my one-eyed monster into you over and over again until you explode in pleasure and swet. 

Author: well, looks like they'll be busy for a little while. Cake?.
Satan: Nooo ~~the cake is a lie~~. Gimme it!

The end
