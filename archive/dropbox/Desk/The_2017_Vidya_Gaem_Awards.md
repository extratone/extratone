On Saturday, the internet’s most prestigious annual awards ceremony for Electronic Games was [streamed](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/230073331) for its [seventh year](https://2017.vidyagaemawards.com). The Vidya Gaem Awards are an extraordinary exercise in video editing, motion graphics, and infallibly sophisticated comedic writing of the highest degree which sometimes feel like gargantuan, collaborative capstone projects for the widest-encompassing art degree of all time. They are hilarious, beautiful, startlingly original, and obscenely entertaining events which are made possible by a whole host of our friends.
