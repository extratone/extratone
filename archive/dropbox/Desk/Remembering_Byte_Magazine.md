## What today’s tech journalism must learn again from the legendary computer publication.

Long-dead *BYTE Magazine* gained some exposure this time last year when some of its gorgeous retro-futurist cover art - of Robert Tinney’s hand - circulated about [Tumblr](http://70sscifiart.tumblr.com/post/160419626518/cover-of-byte-1981-by-bob-tinney) and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/jaxter0ne/byte-magazine/). It *is* fucking beautiful, yes, but I was then quite disappointed to find little in the way of the publication’s actual content available on the web.

Last week, I was elated to find [this exceptional archive on archive.org](http://bit.ly/bytemag) with its exceptionally-scanned, ultra-high res PDFs of *every issue*, created by the archivist [Jason Scott](https://twitter.com/textfiles). The notables of its legacy are fairly [well-documented](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine&tab=about) - and it’s still occasionally cited by the likes of [*Wired*](https://www.wired.com/insights/2012/03/the-personal-cloud/) **and [*TIME*](http://time.com/60505/this-1981-computer-magazine-cover-explains-why-were-so-bad-at-tech-predictions/), but its story and mission have been ashamedly disregarded as infeasible relics; the naivete of the originator.

In Vol. 1, Issue 1 for September 1975, Carl Helmers’ first editorial - “[What is BYTE?](http://extratone.com/library/whatisbyte-carlhelmers.pdf)” - is a charming introduction, full of techno-idealism and the quaint jargon of the then-obscure computing niche. *The Home Brew Computing Triology* is an ingenius summation of the technological conversation: **HARDWARE, SOFTWARE,** and **APPLICATIONS** - the “interrelated themes.” Helmers notes that the publication was founded to bridge the divide between the respective hardware and software cultures and get them talking about *applications.* Later in the issue, publisher Wayne Green [explains](http://extratone.com/library/howbytestarted-waynegreen.pdf) how his encounters with the community amidst a journey to modernize *73* - his amateur radio magazine - led to this prompt.

“I discovered an interesting thing - few of the hardware chaps could talk software - and vice versa.”

A sensical and exciting pitch, to be sure, but disappointing when one considers the remaining vastness of this gulf over 40 years later. The successors to *BYTE* - when compared to any of its trade magazine contemporaries - aren’t *technology news* at all. Mastheads like *The Verge*, *Engadget*, and *CNET* have become something else, entirely in the pursuit of the *end user* click, and a good lot of them simply *look like shit*. Reading up on tech hasn’t been a respectful or aesthetically-pleasant endeavor for as long as I’ve been literate, and *BYTE*’s experience would suggest that it’s been without much worthy cause, whatsoever.

[Typographically](https://fontsinuse.com/uses/7902/byte-magazine-covers-1976-84), its pages are a bit dense, but it’s in an otherworldy mysticism regarding the pioneers of digital that one longs to reanimate, somehow.
