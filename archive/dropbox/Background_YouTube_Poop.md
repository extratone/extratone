    “We’re the people that you only find when you’re knee-deep in the community.”

There were a couple things that I got wrong on DryCast. The first YouTube Poop was somehow created in 2004, before YouTube existed…
It was created by ‘SuperYoshi’ and at the time was only labeled as a parody. However it wasn’t until YouTube’s second year or so (2006) where the genre became more of a commonly made thing. Almost all of them were uploaded to exclusively YouTube, back when other video sharing services such as ZippCast and Myspace were still relevant. (God I feel so fucking old for saying that…) So the choice to ONLY upload these videos to YouTube granted the name “YouTube Poop”. It was uploaded to YouTube and the quality of the content is…poop…for lack of better term, blame whoever invented the name. Probably MrSimon or something but the guy is suicidal enough so his own demons punish him anyways lol.
