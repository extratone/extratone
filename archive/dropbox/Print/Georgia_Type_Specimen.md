# Georgia Type Specimen

# Description

After my niece showed my mother how to change the default font of Microsoft Word and other text editors/word processors a few years go, she has done so for literally every document she's written - personal and professional - including actual printed legal testimony submitted to actual court hearings. Her typeface of choice? Good ole' [Georgia](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/georgia), the OG serif web font other than Times New Roman. For her birthday this year, it didn't occur to me until five weeks too late that I could craft a type specimen for her to display in her bedroom/office using my [newfound commitment](https://www.davidblue.wtf/commemorating-extratone-errors/) to learning Adobe InDesign.

Considering my lack of design experience, I naturally sought out other type specimens from which to familiarize myself with the general concept. Ironically, I found far more [on Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/dieselgoth/typography-indulgence/) than I did/have [on Adobe's Behance](https://www.behance.net/collection/178831129/Typography), and the vast majority - especially of a more or less non-commercial typeface like Georgia - appeared to be school projects. Without sounding like an ad for Adobe Creative Cloud, I had the brilliant idea of using [Adobe Capture for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adobe-capture-creative-camera/id1040200189) to sample the color palette of mom's bedroom and office.[efn_note]If you're interested, the palettes can be found in [my Creative Cloud library](https://shared-assets.adobe.com/link/918df937-0729-4126-4406-298a2bb80a84).[/efn_note] The "workflow" of getting them to InDesign wasn't exactly intuitive: I tried first importing them into Photoshop, but the resulting "Swatches" were empty, for whatever reason (I'm assuming it had something to do with setting them as CYMK instead of RGB in the app as I was capturing them.) Eventually, I just ended up transfering them from scratch to InDesign swatches via [an online color converter/palette maker](https://coolors.co/).

I decided to include a quote from a [2006 Alice Rawsthorn piece in the New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/09/style/09iht-dlede10.2150992.html), all of [a New Yorker profile of Georgia's designer, Matthew Carter](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2005/12/05/man-of-letters-4), and all of [Georgia's entry in Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/font-list/georgia).

Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any independent/momnpop printing businesses anywhere nearby, so we used FedEx Kinkos' online printing service. Considering, the result came out much better than I expected, and included a 40% off coupon for another printing job, so it looks like I may be printing mockups for Extratone's Issue One cover in the near future. Stay tuned, I suppose.

Font (or type) specimens are generally as much - if not more - of a commercial project than one of "pure" design pursuits, which is why I thought creating one for such a distinctly non-commercial - and yet so widely-loved typeface as Georgia might prove to be a unique and personally-fulfilling way to brush up on InDesign.
