# Ending Year Two

As of Friday, two years have passed since Extratone's launch, and I'm afraid this letter will fail to live up to my grandiose and extremely sentimental [celebration of year one](http://www.extratone.com/meta/12/) from last May. We have explored still further since - evolving our platform and its satellite media into their adult form and striding ever closer to finding our identity. For myself, this project has continued to teach more and more even though I almost destroyed and neglected to fix it for the past few months.

Stylistically, we stopped fiddling and settled into Version 4 in [late August](http://www.extratone.com/meta/15/), establishing a template that should remain a sound environment for our foreseeable future. Our [weekly newsletter](http://extratone.com/email) also found its bright, bold, clean aesthetic - in contrast with the Extranet - and its beat of Division, Art, and Media before its spotty hiatus. Aggregating the best of these subjects from our [reading list](http://extratone.com/read) was an enjoyable and extremely educational experience for me, personally, so I hope to resume regular delivery in the coming months.

Unfortunately, a database error combined with my lack of a total grasp on the gritty details of web development resulted in an unacceptably long downtime of several weeks as late-Winter became Spring. Sorry about that. I understand now what I was neglecting, so extended absences shouldn’t be an issue in the future. It was strangely sickening to know the site was down and a tremendous relief when I managed to restore it, last month.

We’ve made only a few changes since [February’s letter](http://bit.ly/freqcheck18), but I’d like to report the most serious one first: **the Extranet** ****is now compliant with the EU’s** [**General Data Protection Regulation**](https://www.eugdpr.org/), which becomes effective on the 25th. I’m not an expert, but I’m 90% sure that we actually have been all along, not that the law itself applies to us, yet. However, there is no longer *any* reason for the existence of user accounts, here, or for us to retain any user data whatsoever because we are advertising-free, so I’ve personally deleted all of the 1000+ user accounts and any content/data associated with them from the CMS along with all of their offline backups/exports from my machine. Technically, we still have the data within compressed site-wide backups, but - as I discovered during the site’s aforementioned brush with web death - they are all unreadable and unrecoverable. However, we’re going to refrain from deleting them until we find a better solution. Until then, we’ll still be *technically* (and legally, I’d assume) retaining your data in this corrupt form. (Though this is well within our rights in the United States for the moment, please feel free to [email me personally](mailto: davidblue@extratone.com) if you have any questions about where your data is going.)

Our [Privacy Policy](http://extratone.com) and [Terms of Use](http://extratone.com/terms) remain unchanged by this purge because we allow [Google Analytics](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to track your visits, though it is up for debate whether or not we will continue to do so given [recent discoveries about the disturbing state of their company ethics](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy). If you’ve opted to receive any of our email newsletters in the past, we still have access to any information you volunteered via our account with [MailChimp](http://mailchimp.com/legal/privacy), which is legally responsible for its possession, along with that which is collected when you engage with our accounts on any other service.

Even though it’s more topical than ever right now, I’m going to spare you yet another rant about web privacy and advertising because my only birthday gift this year is our **new subreddit** - [r/trato](https://new.reddit.com/r/trato/) - (which we’re excited for you to visit and engage with, if only to complain,) and most of what I would end up arguing has been more publicly discussed than ever, as of late.

However, I’d still be remiss if I didn’t revisit and reflect upon my favorites of our second year (in loose chronological order,) but I’d first like to once again send a **BIG** thanks Ben Stokes for his generous support along with the whole rest of his crew and their guests for letting us in [*The Movie Closet*](http://extratone.com/moviecloset) **for [72 hilarious, diverse, and often-profound episodes](http://bit.ly/tmctube) over nearly two years which represent a *huge* amount of energy, commitment, and talent. They’ve decided to move on to other projects, but their [last episode for True/False 2018](http://bit.ly/moviecloset72yt) is a must-watch, and I’d strongly suggest you subscribe to [Spanktravision’s channel](http://bit.ly/spanktravision) and follow [Ben on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BennyBeats111) to stay updated with their future work.

# Best of Year Two

I’ve probably mentioned Isiah’s “[5 Day’s of Soylent](http://bit.ly/isiahsoylent)” far too much since its publication and it’s been on the frontpage since just before our downtime, so I’ll simply say: read it now if you haven’t already.

*Nobody knows what a generation raised on low quality content is going to look like. It’s unimaginable — adults, existing who grew up playing* Elsa Pregnant Surgery *games and watching* Five Nights At Freddies *Funny Sexy Montages.*
⊛ The consequences of YouTube’s profound influence on our society is increasingly in the media spotlight as The Tump Era continues on, but nobody has summed it more concisely than our own Junie Cortez in “[The Children of The Search](http://bit.ly/searchchildren).”

*We spend our whole lives trying to grow up, move on, and get out… but now I’m starting to go back and see all these things I missed.*
⊛ One day, I hope Eryn and I will have the opportunity to continue *Runnin’ Down a Dream* - the audio diary of our bizarre adventures revisiting the small rural towns of our Missouri home. Its single present [pilot episode](http://bit.ly/rdadguns) was an entertaining recount of our ridiculous trip to Mark Twain’s Mississippi-side stomping grounds, and a welcome personal departure from the future which was definitely worth sharing.

*Victoria has been offline for 3257 days, meaning that on July 30, 2008, she logged onto Steam for the first time, figured out how to create a group, attempting to find her son, and promptly logged out, leaving a potential feed of information about her boy in the dust for 8 years and 11 months.*
⊛ In “[Hale](http://bit.ly/isiahhale),” Isiah recounts his investigation into the legitimacy of a “cry for help” he stumbled upon in his effort to join 1000 Steam groups, setting his usual wit within a heavier frame that opens a window into an absolutely tantalizing beat which we desperately need to widen further: the infinite mysteries hidden throughout the crannies of the World Wide Web.

*Suppliers have metamorphosed into luxury brands because their products have become virtually unattainable to the commoner, and people will pay A Shit Load for t-shirts from resellers with a small red box logo. Seriously, fuck the stock market - reselling streetwear is a better hustle.*
⊛ I believe firmly that style should be liberated from its legacy fashion magazine prison, and our Culture Editor Leo Marx is notably the best-dressed man I’ve ever met. Though he may be Extratone’s other Old Man, he is no way confined by retro romanticism in “[Streetwear](http://bit.ly/marxwear),” yet another example to follow in future work, and unquestionably our most *useful* piece yet.

*How blissfully ignorant those kayakers were, going about their paddling business, unaware of the hulking metal apparatus under their entombed lower body. It drew me in, its form undulating and varying in width in geometrically impossible ways. I came closer and closer until my nose nearly scraped its terrible teeth.*
⊛ We were all tremendously proud of our deep-cover Prose Ghost (who’s assumed byline is K. I. Eleutherios XVII for protection) when they managed to succeed where so many talented investigators have failed in infiltrating the facade of the Times Square kayak rental industry. “[The Truth About Kayaks](http://bit.ly/kayaktruth)” is by a long way our most exclusive and hard-hitting reporting thus far.

# The Coming Year

Honestly, as much as we grew and learned, we (mostly *I*) failed to achieve the primary goal I set for Extratone 365 days ago: significantly less of my byline, *way* more of others. In fact, my share has *increased.* Both our move to Portland and our late downtime took significantly more time than I could’ve ever imagined, uprooting my reality and allowing me to step back and reflect on where I want *Extratone* to go and how better to get us there. It’s clear that what I’ve been doing isn’t working - I have yet to figure out an effective way to apply my time to building a community, and it doesn’t make sense to continue sacrificing my body, mind, and finances without appropriate results. My living situation has changed dramatically in such a way that 2017’s daily regimen would be impossible, anyway.

While I’ve been failing to use my energy as a platform for other voices, I’ve understood for a long time how to build my own, so I’m declaring *Extratone*’s primary goal for the next year to be **publishing original, emotionally and intellectually-stimulating work as it comes**, while my *personal* goal will be building my own literacy in both the trade and the subjects which we are here to cover. Yes, the latter could not be more at odds with the core mission of this magazine, but trust me when I tell you that my commitment to building this publication has not waned in the slightest - it’s simply time to figure out another way to achieve it.

I seriously doubt readers or participants in the community will notice much aside from the way I treat my own work. I’ll remain constantly in our [Discord](http://bit.ly/holeguest), immediately reachable by [email](mailto: davidblue@extratone.com), and my enthusiasm for new work will always be huge and immediate, but in the time between pitches and submissions, I’m going to focus on the list of potential works I’ve built up. I doubt also that I will require more than a few months to figure out how to proceed, and I promised you’ll be exhaustively apprised of my progress in real time.

As I’ve admitted too many times before, ***Extratone*** **is my offspring** and its future (as in, the future of those of whom it is comprised both now and ahead) is literally *always* on my mind, so - barring insanity or death - it’s always going to get better and brighter and I’m never… ever… going to stop Tweeting about it, so you may as well block me now.
