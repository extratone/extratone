[x] On the theme of **fast** and **loud**: the text is louder, it’s delivered faster, there’s more of it, and I’ve taken away your last methods of quickly escaping from it.
## Trimming, slimming, and troubleshooting The Extranet left us ten times faster and much, much louder.

After spending a few weeks doting on The Extranet with precisely the same attention I’ve pledged *not* to lavish upon it, I think you’ll be satisfied with the results, though probably much less so than I am. More importantly, our old friend [Ryan Dell](http://twitter.com/ryandeel) graced us with his flawless satire in “[Unsolicited Creative Advice](http://bit.ly/creativeadvice),” which will no doubt occupy the frontpage for a good while. As per the temporary return of my focus upon my own work which I described [last month](http://bit.ly/freqcheck19), I was able to knock out a healthy chunk of the pet topics I’d been sitting on for years. I wrote about [Google as our new God](http://bit.ly/googlechurch), the [sinister symbols I saw in](http://bit.ly/solosw) [*Han Solo: A Star Wars Story*](http://bit.ly/solosw), the [importance of Twitter lists](http://bit.ly/uselists), and [the State of Word Processing in 2018](http://bit.ly/textinred).

I’ve also been working on compiling a “Visual History of *Extratone*,” which I’d eventually like to display in a unique-ish online photo gallery (for now, it’s [on Flickr](http://bit.ly/evflickr),) and *The Drycast Master Collection*, which I’d also like to present (and probably sell,) in some clever medium. So far, I’ve updated the style and metadata of episodes 1-18 and in the process unearthed the [long-lost yzome episode](http://bit.ly/drycast9), which includes a superb discussion of modern music that’s more than worth **an immediate listen**.

I took the time to [post us on](http://bit.ly/extrfonts) [*Fonts in Use*](http://bit.ly/extrfonts) – one of my favorite nerdy design projects on the web – which almost immediately led to some great feedback from Co-Editor Florian Hardwig regarding my typographic sins (“Oof!”) and an embarrassing misspacing within our big Butler mast, which I have now corrected and darkened. It looks significantly better, no?

In the process of whipping up my submission, I summed up my bizarre relationship with this Web Site better still than I ever have before.


    *Because we chose to experiment and build the look ourselves from a position of relative inexperience with web design instead of seeking out a professional solution, The Extranet as it exists now represents more than two years of exhaustive trial and error that was a significant learning experience for myself, especially. It has been tinkered with, poured over, and broken exponentially more than if we’d chosen to turn its creation over to third-party hands. As a result, our team’s become bizarrely sentimental and proud of it as a part of our organization’s identity.*

As proud as I am to have us in the definitive design catalog on the web, I’ve made enough significant changes since the post to render it relatively out-of-date, already. First, I tracked down and eliminated the [server error](http://www.extratone.com/shife/methods-of-composition-stealing-from-ibm/) which caused our downtime at the beginning of the year before systematically optimizing *the shit* out of just about everything until I could regularly benchmark The Extranet at 10 times its pageload speed from this time in 2017. After fixing and emboldening the mast, I then slightly upped the weight of *all* typefaces, site-wide, but I still found [Cormorant Garamond](http://www.behance.net/gallery/28579883/Cormorant-an-open-source-display-font-family)’s performance to be insufficient within our new speedy experience. Where we once decided upon it for body text because it *wasn’t* the obvious choice and we thought its decorative flair to be loud in its vanity, I all at once found it *feeble* and *weak* in contrast with the header’s new got-it-togetherness.
 
For the moment, we’ve switched to Georg Duffner’s [EB Garamond](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/eb-garamond) – an open source, more robust digitization of The Big G – but I may be testing other bodies on the live server so *watch the fuck out*. In Version 4.3, the header no longer sticks, the scroll-to-top button has disappeared at last, and images will be sharper.

**Fast** and **loud**: I’m writing more in a heavier typeface delivered significantly faster and I’ve taken away both of your last methods of quickly escaping it. Good luck.
