## A brand unification frenzy, a failed stunt, a new tactical oracle, and a continually more-invested commitment to respecting our audience in our way.

I’d like to extend you a warm welcome to *peachytone -* the reddest magazine on the World Wide Web. *Extranet version four point oh* is here, today - right now… at this very moment - and denotes several key changes and additions - many of which you’ve already seen these past weeks, including - thank God - a site-wide disabling of comments, a refreshed color palette, section visuals & footer, and our darling typography. No, we did not plan the launch in accordance with the solar eclipse, but it’s an awfully-poetic coincidence of reinvention, yes?

Didn’t think us capable of such mysticism? Go read [your horoscope](http://extratone.com/future), bilgeweed.

We were enthralled to finally [open submissions](http://www.extratone.com/meta/announcements/emailawards2017/) for *The First Annual Email Awards* - a celebratory contest pitch from way back when. More details are to come as the end of 2017 draws a bit nearer, but it’s time to begin spamming the public [Google Doc](http://bit.ly/niceemail) with screenshots/hyperlinks of any message that may come to your mind as spectacular, extraordinary, surreal, etc.

Also - in case you were wondering why Lead Tech Editor [Hawthorn Bradley Jr.](https://twitter.com/hawthorn_jr) has been removed from the [masthead](http://extratone.com/masthead) - I’m happy to announce that she’s decided to move on… to become my wife. We’re getting married on the 15th of next month. Whether that’s a promotion, demotion, or termination, I’ll let you decide.

# Editorially

[*Nels Nelson’s Future Machine*](http://extratone.com/future) is unquestionably the most editorially relevant property we’ve ever absorbed. I’d love to tell you that [August’s](http://extratone.com/horoscopes/august2017) [*horoscope*](http://extratone.com/horoscopes/august2017) was simply a placeholder for the platform until we could find ourselves (where would you even begin?) a Real Life Star Scribe, but it was - in fact - the legitimate, abstract predictions of [Nelson Nelson](http://extratone.com/future) - Creative Director, Hell. 

Consider: **Extratone** - *building beautiful, one-of-a-kind platforms for the cheapest jokes.*

Our dearest *Prose Ghost -* [K. I. Eleutherios XVII](http://extratone.com/eleu) - wrote both of our features, this month: [*The Truth About Kayaks*](http://bit.ly/kayaktruth), and [*The Ven*](http://bit.ly/veneat) *-* neither of which were true, in the slightest, nor marked as such in any way. ([Oops](http://www.poynter.org/2017/news-or-opinion-online-its-hard-to-tell/470559/). Sorry.) Honestly, though, do you *actually* need to be explicitly told whether or not what you’re reading/watching is satire, in this climate. *Can you*, even?

*Is this a joke?*

I don’t know. Does it matter?

Actually, yes, it does, when you’re throwing around threats of violence, like my [announcement](http://bit.ly/guspledge) and “pledge drive” a few weeks ago claiming I’d kill a small, pitiful cocker-spaniel if we did not gain five subscribers in 5 hours.  As I explained in my [*super-New-Media-Medium-Post*](https://medium.com/@FickleCrux/the-dog-is-a-live-1819bd74a348), I was genuinely surprised at how negatively many readers, friends, and staff reacted.

![](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_BAAC6BA95754A59B8D069DB7A259F6015AF5CEFF34B625B0E3C5665296E8D0DF_1503047178957_fuckindead.png)


Obviously, My Post wouldn’t be difficult to classify as an *apology*, per se, but a sort of rant out of one genuine sentiment: *really, dude?* You think I’m *actually* threatening to hurt an animal for *patrons*??!! Blame’s not relevant, but I know *for a fact* that y’all are smarter than that. 

I’m still not quite sure how to respond, and with just my limited life experience, I know that all attempts to parse misunderstandings of this nature lead to unnecessary - and often, highly unpleasant - bouts of silent seething, rejection, and/or general passive aggression. The thing is - being “misunderstood” is not a disease - it is a result of your poor ability to communicate yourself and your ideas. Children throw *tantrums* when they’re frustrated with their inability to communicate - you wouldn’t be wrong to suggest that my decision to behave this way was nothing but an *edgy*, Big Boy equivalent, and you won’t see anything like it again, from us. *(It should also be noted that neither Hawthorn nor Tim condoned it, particularly, so it’s a* ***confirmed blunder****, regardless of anything.)*

Though that’s not quite all of it, I’m afraid - I *was* trying to argue a position, and - despite how foully I went about it - it *is* a pillar of Extratone’s existence to treat you as an intelligent human being with the capability to make appropriate use of what you read - to assume that we can’t fool you, even if we had motivation to, and to eliminate patronization from our voice as thoroughly as possible. You *are* smarter than SEO, social cards, stock featured images, and sensationalism; smarter than the bait you’ve been falling for, and we *will* prove it to you and the whole of the media industry, or we’ll die trying. Compromise is an important skill, but it makes for a shitty life philosophy, and our extremity - if you’d call it that - is perhaps the most essential privilege allowed to us by our independence.

When I happened to glance at my [*Recode Media*](https://www.recode.net/2017/8/10/16115548/patreon-jack-conte-fan-pledges-subscription-paywall-recode-media-peter-kafka-podcast) feed to see Jack Conte’s name, I was embarrassingly giddy. Peter Kafka is perhaps the best media reporter ever to grease the stale annals of insider-industry culture and his opposite embodies the *w h i t e  c r e a t i v e  s t a r t u p -* the "well just because ***you*** had to live that way..." generation. Not that he isn't an *excellent* musician - I distinctly remember ghostriding my truck through weekday afternoon suburbia to *Pomplamoose*'s [cover](https://youtu.be/xycnv87N_BU) of *September*, but uttering such privilege-**stuffed** phrases as "*The Creative Class*" can do well to immediately discard talent, washing his voice away into the Startup Cult Stigma, which is a particular shame because it is utterly unnecessary.

It’s a nice sentiment that Jolly Ole Jack would place so faith in the societal function of *creatives*, but it’s important to remember that the [majority](http://www.pewglobal.org/interactives/global-population-by-income/) of human beings work their asses off for nothing *until they fucking die*. I won’t flood you with too much *class* stuff today - and yes, this inevitably looks an awful lot like a *oh shit we have to distance ourselves from this guy* post (because it it is, sortof) - but I truly believe we can have “crowdfunded” dialog about things that *privileged-as-hell* people like us care about with a bit more dignity and self-awareness, acknowledging just how *fucking cringey* use of terms like *creative class* could make the experience for our more academic(?) audience.

Although we no longer support comments, we still want to hear what you have to say about topics like these and - should you desire - publish your thoughts alongside ours. Send correspondence to [horn@extratone.com](mailto:horn@extratone.com), or your preferred [alternative](http://extratone.com/contact), along with your name and whatever social links you’d like to share (indicating your preferred destination for your words, of course,) and we might just launch that *Letters* section we’ve been mulling over.

# Mechanically

*Um, David Blue… after all that complaining, you release this* “4.0” *thing but all I see are… different colors and typography.*

Obviously, *versions* are a bit of a personal novelty, as *most* of the changes I’d list in 4.0’s *version notes* - were they to exist outside this format - have actually been implemented on the live site before your eyes for the [past few months](http://extratone.com/freq). Speaking of personal novelties: I have decided - to absolutely *nobody*’s particular disposition - that our dear *Extranet*’s CMS has been *so* heavily prodded, stretched, punctured, customized, constricted, and molested that it is *surely* no longer WordPress… it has become something else, entirely… and I have officially christened it *BILGE* with all the digital affection in my heart. It is my hope that my obsessive personal journey of web development is *finally* and *definitively* over, with this release. Hawthorn and I planned to spend our honeymoon in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone, but we’ll be making due with (*my*) ritual *Log Off*. 

The “New” section had been at the top of *Hustonia* since Day 1, and probably accounted for the vast majority of first-time user confusion. We’ve addressed this by redubbing it [*Fresh*](http://extratone.com/fresh) for the moment, but aren’t quite satisfied with the term to move in any heavy furniture, just yet. A seven-volume Dictionary Dive for a better synonym is an Editorial endeavor, of course, but in the meantime, we hope you’ll enjoy its retouched functionality and new art. [*Words*](http://extratone.com/written) received the latter, as well, as we slowly digest minimally-tailored sections one by one.

Though it’s not a particularly big deal, our new frontpage format has been confusing our Holy Google, these past few months, but I’ve just taken out a loan against what’s left of my soul to put things in order again, which should help some of the dozens of locals I’ve been talking to who’ve asked “extra***TOE***?” Yes, it is quite the *brand joke*, but it’s happened often enough to justify our acquisition of [extratoe.com](http://extratoe.com) to make sure everybody gets home safe! Please do us a favor and pray to your God that we never receive an offer on this new property from any pornography production companies.

Horn - our lovely social bot - has been snowballing in mass at a terrific rate! It now posts automatically (and utterly sporadically, at the moment) on [our new Telegram channel](http://bit.ly/tratogram) and [primary Discord ticker](https://discord.gg/RhcgzaC). These aren’t essential capabilities for us, by any means, but crudely-constructed bots like mine are quite adorable and “*neat.”* That said, should you find yourself encountering a malfunction or disturbance to your reading experience, taking the time to [report it](http://extratone.com/test) would be Really Swell of ya.



- **A fresh new, peachy color palette** which was decided upon thanks to feedback from a few of you, along with more gray spacers to mitigate as-of-yet unavoidably unused space and add a sense of cohesion.
- ***New*** **section renamed to** ***Fresh*** in the interest of reducing any chronological confusion. 
- **A big, sexy new Butler Stencil logo** in a more sensibly-scaled top space.
- **A new reading experience** thanks to twenty-two pixel, ultra-slim Cormorant body text, Italiana titles, SC-ed Playfair in the nav, and Butler headers. Additionally, our 18-month-long war with side padding is finally turning in our favor.
- **The footer has been polished**, resurrected from transparency, updated typographically, and adorned with a big, on-brand delta hyperlinked to our [subscription options](http://extratone.com/subscribe).
- 🔑 for the now-irrelevant ‘auto’ tag has been replaced with 📲, linking [our new Telegram channel](http://t.me/extratone) in the speedy menu.

The virtually limitless possibilities of digital media can become - for obsessives like myself - a virtually unending, unshakable hell of excruciating revision. Frankly, *I’ve overdone it* this past year - it’s time for me to step away from Extratone’s technical and administrative chores for a period of rest and refocus - to wrap up a few longform pieces of my own. I’m mostly mentioning it here in hopes that my vanity will guarantee that I abide by this promise, but I *do* sincerely hope you enjoy this darling thing we built for you.

Here’s to the Sticky Peach! May it hold out against me for months to come.
