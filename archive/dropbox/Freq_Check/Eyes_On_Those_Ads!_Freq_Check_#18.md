It’s (still) a new year! For the first time in *Extratone*’s history, I have *missed* *three of these*, but I *did* crash my car in Portland. We are still here and working, but our entrance into 2018 will be a bit sluggish, I’m afraid. No, we have not changed our minds about advertising on the website - we plan to stick to that pledge forever, but Patreon’s new [paywall integration](https://www.patreon.com/apps/wordpress) is worth discussing. Let’s go over what we *have* done since last Fall before we start asking questions.

Our First Annual Email Awards have [not been forgotten](http://www.extratone.com/meta/announcements/awardsdelayed/)! The ceremonial contest will decide the best Emails sent and received in 2017. We’d originally planned to host it in January, but we’re now hoping for late Spring, which means there’s still time for you to reflect on your inboxes, pick out your favorites, and send them to us at **horn@extratone.com**. Multiple submission methods seemed to complicate things, so we’re now simply asking you to… *send an Email*.

As always, [*The Movie Closet*](http://extratone.com/moviecloset) hasn’t let you down while the rest of us have been away. They’ve delivered on entertaining topics like a [hypothetical portrayal of themselves](http://www.extratone.com/audio/moviecloset/you/), [out-of-typecast performances](http://www.extratone.com/audio/moviecloset/unexpected/), and - naturally - [naked sex scenes](http://www.extratone.com/audio/moviecloset/sex/) (for episode #69,) as well as *best ofs* current cinema - for [last year’s films](http://www.extratone.com/audio/moviecloset/bestof2017/), and the [Academy Awards](http://www.extratone.com/audio/moviecloset/best/).

It’s also the time once again for Columbia, Missouri’s annual [*True/False Film Festival*](http://www.extratone.com/truefalse/). Tim and I [went in 2017](http://www.extratone.com/audio/futureland/dweeb/), but in the coming weeks, the Closet Crew will be bearing down upon it with all of their cinema authority, which is important and exciting. As March begins, everybody in the world of documentary film - directors, actors, subjects, activists, academics, and journalists - descends upon our hometown at its best, transforming it into “[the hub of creative non-fiction, a place where artists, citizens, and everyone in between gather to share in exciting new visions from around the globe](https://www.rogerebert.com/festivals-and-awards/truefalse-film-festival-2017).” Nearly 20 years spent in Columbia made it no less recognizable - for the better - during last year’s festival. To attend as press was an intoxicating, fascinating, emotionally-exhausting experience that I’ll never forget. My film literacy really let it down, I think, but it is of a significantly lesser caliber than that of [Mikel](http://instagram.com/mikel_bass), [Ben](https://twitter.com/BennyBeats111), [Sam](http://instagram.com/unclespami), [Matt](http://instagram.com/jonathan_matthew_hall), and friends. 

A friend of a friend of ours works for SpaceX - Elon Musk’s opaque space carnival - and they’d like to talk about it. I doubt we’ll be singlehandedly bringing their rapacious rockets down, but I hear the hours *really suck*. We’re hoping to publish a conversation in the very near future. A few weeks ago, we [launched](http://www.extratone.com/tech/openweb/) an [ongoing list](http://extratone.com/open) of our favorite projects thanks to The Open Web to celebrate and aggregate those individual designers and organizations who continue to resist the industry’s incentive to plaster aging, blandly-designed, and feature-engorged architecture with premade ads and cheap, run-of-the-mill templates. The surface of the internet as it is doesn’t have long left to live, and we’d like to think that the innovators you find if you dig deep enough now will be rewarded for their creativity in the coming years.

I’ve spent the past month or so complaining a lot. I wrote about [Mark Zuckerberg as your class enemy](http://www.extratone.com/tech/meaningful/), Martin McDongah’s [*Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri*](http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/threebillboards/) (also your class enemy,) [Nicolas Cage’s favorite movie](http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/momanddad/), and my experiences as a “power user” with the [iPhone 8 Plus](http://www.extratone.com/tech/iphone8/). Technically, I’m only qualified to argue on the last one, but I’m glad folks seemed to enjoy me at my worst - ranting about a major film production as a native Missourian.

On the first of this month, *Wired* magazine [announced](http://www.extratone.com/tech/openweb/) their new metered paywall on web content, as per the newish reign of [Nick Thompson as Editor-in-Chief](https://www.recode.net/2018/2/1/16957324/wired-paywall-nick-thompson-magazine-advertising-subscription-peter-kafka-recode-media-podcast). It seems like they spent a full week afterwards sending me emails about it. The reality is not quite so extreme, but nevertheless - now that we possess the capability to painlessly implement a paywall - I’m left wondering if I’d really ever like to see us in any facsimile of their position. At the moment, I don’t think it would make sense at all - frankly, we’re still coming out of a lull, but I still think it’s a worthwhile conversation about our future.

Last April, we [moved](http://www.extratone.com/audio/last/) all meta audio content behind a paywall because we felt that *Futureland* would be a lot better off if I had a solid rule against talking about us. Separately, we stopped the show almost immediately afterward to invest more effort into [the newsletter](http://extratone.com/email), so there’s no hard data to say whether or not it would’ve worked. Let’s imagine these Editor’s letters blocked by the above screen, asking you to pay at least a dollar a month to see them. The same logic applies - *why would you read these if you’re not invested enough to subscribe, anyway?*, but the incentives aren’t exactly sound. If anything, it would be a less-intrusive reminder that we need money to keep getting better and you have a straightforward method available should you want to help, but that’s starting to seem a bit naive. The immediate reality for the vast majority of users would be nothing more than paying a fee just to read a bunch of relatively irrelevant, disastrously self-referential nonsense.

In Nick Thompson’s conversation with Peter Kafka on *Recode Media*, he cited the classical advantages to the paywall model, as per his experience with *The New Yorker*’s transition as Online Editor. “You’re trying to build a really deep relationship with your reader,” he said. *Introducing* the new, *deeper* *Wired*-reader investment by first requiring a subscription, however, is contingent upon their existing relationships with their vast legacy readership. He *also* claimed to be in the midst of a “CMS migration,” which is *desperately* needed for *Wired*, and has been for way too long - but… I have yet to see any evidence of such a journey. That the announcement itself was published on their broken, hopelessly-overworked Wordpress platform reflects this money-first attitude that Condé Nast properties can technically afford to operate within.

In other words, it’s the shittier way to do it, and when Thompson suggests that “publishers have *no choice* but to think about how to diversify their business models,” his accuracy is a matter of a *very* divided perspective, resource-wise. Of course, *Wired*’s demographic - the “more technologically significant readers” aren’t exactly poor young techie college students anymore - they’re well on their way to becoming the richest group in human history, but they were once idealists of the *Open Information For All* sort. Now, the Silicon Valley Libertarians will pay, but it’s a shame they weren’t instead reminded of why they shouldn’t have to - why they should expect the Big Boys to take a little risk and invest in making the good stuff *before* they ask for a return. Perhaps it’s presumptuous of me to critique an industry staple like Thompson, but I know that I’d have rather *declared* my will be done - that *it* would make the changes rather than *expected* incentives which I did my best to conjure to *influence* the course of my ship over significant periods of time. That way, the risk would lie with my publisher instead of my readers.

*Extratone*, though, is not owned by Condé Nast, and I am not God. Most of the readers we’d like to meet & keep are somewhere within our vast social circles already - they are smart, inventive, and creative 18-30 year olds, which means they are… financially stressed. Asking them for single digits a month, even, has significant weight. Whatever content we may or may not decide to place behind a paywall should be *exceptional*, and access to it should be free to those who can’t afford it, and are willing to ask. [Linda Solomon Wood’s](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/01/we-stepped-in-and-started-doing-it-how-one-woman-built-an-award-winning-news-outlet-from-her-dining-room-table/) [*National Observer*](http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/01/we-stepped-in-and-started-doing-it-how-one-woman-built-an-award-winning-news-outlet-from-her-dining-room-table/), **for instance, is still accessible to those who send whatever they can by mail - perhaps we could simply do the same for those who ask for it via email. Then again, that might imply a requisite explanation of a reader’s inability to pay, which will never be okay. I look forward to your take on these issues - *please*, [send me an email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com).

## Before you go, here are a few more thoughts/questions of note:

⊚ Would it be worth it for us to find and/or develop a method of embedding the [reading list](http://extratone.com/read) outside Discord?
⊚ To date, *Extratone* has published 173,000 words in total, meaning we will eclipse Gore Vidal’s *Lincoln* before Spring.
⊚ The design of this letter represents the first time we have ever properly conformed to any [brand guidelines](https://www.patreon.com/brand/guidelines).
⊚ *A lot* of excess fat was trimmed from the backend for the first time in nearly a year, meaning that you should see vastly smoother scrolling and general navigation. According to our estimates, page load times should be down to half or less what they’ve been.
⊚ [Patreon Lens has arrived](https://patreon.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000160623-How-do-I-view-my-creator-s-Lens-post-)! It’s sorta like original Snapchat, but for patrons. We’ll be posting regularly - two or three times a week, for now - for those who’ve signed up for the [$1/month entry subscription tier](http://bit.ly/tonesub1).
