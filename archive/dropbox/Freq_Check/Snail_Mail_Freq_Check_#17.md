It’s a despicably *90s youth* way to describe The Post, isn’t it? Painful, even. Regardless, all of our linguistic sins are forgiven, today, as we finally have an assured, *dedicated* Post Office Box for you to fill with just about anything!

*P.O. Box 1343*
*Beaverton, OR 97075*

By *anything*, well… Unfortunately, I must request that you do not mail us any explosive devices - as stated in our updated [contact page](http://extratone.com/contact) - because our little Beaverton Post Office is much too cute, frankly, and we’re a bit too busy to digest any federal investigations, at the moment. We really *are* excited to receive just about any other sort of mail, though – regardless of how vile, hateful, encouraging, or supportive it may be! Send us your [submissions](http://extratone.com/submit), feedback, money(?!) or personal sentiments. We might just *freakin’ respond*! (If you leave a return address, of course.)
 
Otherwise, in the wake of last month’s ranty, relatively irrelevant [letter](http://extratone.com/freq/16), and a parsing limp in our [weekly newsletter](http://extratone.com/email), it’s probably seemed like we’ve been lazin around, but frankly – as I write you from [my backseat home](http://bit.ly/portlandbum) – we’re just taking a bit to get set up. Progressive steps in the interest of the Portland Plan *are* being taken, albeit slowly. Luckily, October is Prime Stopping Ground for [*The Movie Closet*](http://extratone.com/moviecloset). [This week’s episode](http://bit.ly/moviecloset57) reflected on some *classics* and the career of Dearest Nick Cage. ([Here’s that bit of lazy research](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/921315222014455813) on Robert Bierman, as requested.) Naturally, you can expect at least one more excellent horror movie-related episode from the bunch before the holiday.
 
As you’ve noticed, I have taken liberal space on the homepage since the move – my reflection on our experience in [Rock Springs, Wyoming](http://bit.ly/rockspringswy), and my own [first time in Virtual Reality](http://bit.ly/latevr) have indeed been ruminating in the digital pages of This Here Website – but with the first colonial groundwork of *Extratone Portland* laid, our most significant shift ever is about to commence. I am in the process of getting a Big Boy job in which to exert my more menial uses for the sake of Extratone and my own living situation. In the interim, I have begun exploring the notable *local* publications – hovering my days away in the cold coffee shop infinitude, absorbing as much of the culture as possible. Luckily, the primary supposition which motored our Blogging Butts to Oregon has consistently proven correct – the *creative* certainly *is* more rewarded here (certainly than in Columbia, Missouri, obviously,) and things *are* moving – but you needn’t take my word for it, just yet.
 
Accounting for the possibility that we may very well become some approximation of a *Local Publication*, I have been exploring the dominant alt-weekly establishment (which is an exciting combination of words to stand behind unironically from the get-go) – namely, [*The Portland Mercury*](http://www.portlandmercury.com/) **– a precious déjà vu-triggering gem, written with just enough irreverence to maintain its relevance, and the relatively-infamous [*Williamette Week*](http://www.wweek.com/), which is apparently willing to put the word “asshole” in print. A good sign, I guess. In turn, *local links* have begun appearing in the [reading list](http://extratone.com/read), and – *I’ll be damned* – we’re considering adding a LOCAL header to [*The Tone*](http://extratone.com/email)’s DIVISION/ART/MEDIA **header triad. Your feedback on the matter would be welcome weight in that new Postal Box of ours, no doubt.

[UMBRELLA]

Now, we must inevitably ask some questions. Is there inherit merit in branding ourselves *local*? Would it result in a net gain for you - the readership, or is it inescapably constricting? Or - as per our commitment to remimagination - is there any power in whatever *brand* we don that we will be unable to control, really? From my perspective, any risks in “moving” Extratone to Oregon are worth a shot at creating something new, here. From the pavement I’ve personally pounded so far, I’d wager that Portlandian goings-on are surely pushing and pulling on American discourse in some fashion or another. I can tell you that the municipal government is quite wealthy and the human beings are unusually kind & diligent, yet somehow, the mood is never huffy. It’s almost profoundly serene.

New proximity to friends and colleagues was perhaps the most enticing allure of the whole idea. Just last night, we spent good time with [Isiah](http://extratone.com/heck) and his fiance. Granted, he *did* officially resign, but resignation has become the popular prank of the bunch - I would expect to see his byline again. We’d love to see your face too, of course - [here’s how to drop us a line](http://extratone.com/contact), one more time. Until next month, catch me trending in an Oregon hobbyshop or the hopelessly-charming Powell’s Books, downtown.
