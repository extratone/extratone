# Bio
David Blue began writing about antique agricultural equipment in grade 1 and quickly moved on to musings on the automotive industry, aviation, and the history of the two in America. As a pre-teen, his early ownership of a first generation iPhone pretentiously inspired him to depart these subjects entirely in order to blog about technology on a Blogger site of his creation and to upload vapid, cringey tech videos on his accompanying YouTube channel. (Both of which have thankfully been lost to time.) At 16, he began another blog and YouTube channel documenting his experiences as a student pilot, finding in video editing a satisfying skillset to perfect.

In high school, David’s adolescent rebellion came in the form of [Drywall](https://ihadtopee.bandcamp.com) - a “counter-counter culture” music project and “movement” which served as a release of his angst and vain obsession with “polish” in his previous endeavors, fostered a new pursuit in audio production/hardware electronics, and continued his opportunities to work with [video](https://youtu.be/FxzVD2zw3aM). The original Twitter/online community into which his high school friends/early partners introduced him during this time would grow to become a founding pillar of Extratone.

David returned to writing and filming about cars after graduating with a weekly column for [*Speedmonkey*](http://www.speedmonkey.co.uk/search/label/David) and the Drywall automotive video series [*Honk*](http://bit.ly/dbhonkyt)*.* With the regular help of friends, Drywall content peaked in [*Drycast*](http://extratone.com/drycast) [](http://extratone.com/drycast)- the weekly audio podcast to which he devoted most of his energy throughout 2015, which has since been absorbed into the Extratone brand (and has sense been intermittently revived,) along with the [original Drywall movies](http://bit.ly/dryfilms), including the ambitious but discontinued *Children of the Corn 30*.

After a short, re-orienting sabbatical from his own byline, David launched *Extratone* in Spring 2016 in the interest of consolidating and unifying the vast amount of revolutionary but often-marginalized voices he’d discovered within the network of visual artists, musicians, engineers, and friends he’d amassed throughout young adulthood, and continues to obsessively pursue new culture and arguments from within the context of the platform and its community.

David enjoys writing about the ongoing evolution of media and the intersection of technology and culture. He does *not* like conversations about food, sex, sleep, or John Tesh, and is no longer allowed to publish a single word about cars.
