## Visually, we now occupy an entirely different ecosystem from when I last wrote you, with a vastly bolstered media beat, more bespoke landing pages, and custom bylines.

I’ve felt what seemed like a slow-down, this summer, but in actuality, we’ve gained voice, consistency, and cohesion. We’d discussed the “crowd-sourced” review app Yelp! on *Drycast* [ages ago](http://bit.ly/drycast43), *and* in its [most recent episode](http://bit.ly/dry57), and have - as citizens of the Earth - remained consistently confused by its continued existence, and by the apparent [lack of discourse](https://www.google.com/search?q=yelp&source=lnms&tbm=nws&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjknInKzrHVAhUB5oMKHTgNAAkQ_AUICigB&biw=1421&bih=670&dpr=1.8) regarding its horrid, petty annals, but we provided nothing more than fragmented rants. Thankfully, Culture Editor [Isiah](https://twitter.com/ammnontet) formalized our collective disgust in [*Criticizing the Critics*](http://bit.ly/isiahyelp), with screenshots and some *legitimate*, very-overdue food knowledge. 

His are the first of our words on the subject, so I considered the contribution a personal favor, and built him his own [landing page](http://extratone.com/heck) out of appreciation for them *and* his [*Hale*](http://bit.ly/isiahhale) piece - a pseudoinvestigative journey into a mother’s cry for help on a Steam group, of all things. As our month began, [Juni Cortez](https://twitter.com/tehpwner2) provided a [short rant](http://bit.ly/searchchildren) about the cultural repercussions of search algorithm use that contains more insight than you might surmise, at first glance.

*Yet another* first came in the fashionable form of [Mr. Marx](http://extratone.com/cactus)’s [guide/brief history of streetwear](http://bit.ly/marxwear).

![Company culture did get a bit out of hand.](https://d2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net/s_FC40C15473A9BD8AE1BFD24C653F02742F2C7022EAC2CD939296BDFEB282F234_1501440405611_ibaligerfanclub.png)

## Editorially

It would seem as though the rest of the world is in turmoil - and it is - but the immediacy of digital media can wear upon one’s soul with its tepid tendencies and vapid habits. We’ve been [reading](http://extratone.com/read) a lot, and we know it certainly has on ours. If you’ve been keeping up in any sense, you know one of our primary functions is to reimagine what it means to be Online, and Quality, Online.

Covering the media beat involves selection, dissection, and digestion of external content - the stuff we read, *why* we read it, and - sometimes - how we feel about both method & meat of what’s said. Our [weekly newsletter](http://bit.ly/thetone) has now been minimalistically aggregating hyperlinks and wrapping them in little bits of wit for a full three months, and the numbers indicate that its readership - though small - has remained encouragingly engaged. We’ve newly integrated an archive into [/email](http://extratone.com/email) in case you’d like a sample before you sign up, or’d just like to browse past week’s issues. 

It’s our aim to continue to provide a uniquely-focused companion to your life - a single-page Sunday pamphlet emphasizing news that’s particularly pertinent to our audience. [The death rattles of the streaming service SoundCloud](https://theoutline.com/post/1917/soundcloud-death), for instance (header of [this Sunday’s issue](http://bit.ly/thetone14)) are inconsequential to the vast majority of digital readers, but a great many producers, DJs, and rappers depend heavily on its platform for their community. To those in our network, its demise would be front-page news.

In aggregation, prevalence makes the brand, but our readership’s relationship with email is less-than-robust, so I published [*The Email Chic*](http://bit.ly/emailchic) - a list of my personal favorite compilers, accompanied by my argument for the future of Electronic Mail and what it could add to those who’ve divorced themselves. I’ve also begun [*The Junction*](http://extratone.com/junction) - a section for those weeks when I feel compelled to write an editor’s companion to [*The Tone*](http://bit.ly/thetone) **in my ongoing journey to assume my True Place as the [Joshua Topolsky](https://theoutline.com/post/1636/the-best-stories-of-the-week-june-4-2017) for NEETs. I intend to keep it relatively low-key, as my own experience in the role is admittedly lacking. It’s experimental. As always, your suggestions are more than welcome.

## Audio

[*The Movie Closet*](http://extratone.com/moviecloset)’s crew [celebrated](http://bit.ly/moviecloset45) the first anniversary of their first episode.

Ben Stokes, Sam, Matt, Mikel Bass, and their guests should be very proud of their exceptional creation, and my appreciation and admiration for their work remains gargantuan.

This month, they tackled [book-sourced](http://bit.ly/moviecloset44) and [locally-sourced](http://bit.ly/moviecloset46) films, [remakes](http://bit.ly/moviecloset42), and [the underdog trope](http://bit.ly/moviecloset43). Their [section](http://extratone.com/moviecloset) and title formats have also been updated and decluttered to better-present their archive.

For old time’s sake, I also extracted a particularly entertaining [conversation](http://bit.ly/dry48clip) from [*Drycast*](http://extratone.com/drycast)’s [48th episode](http://bit.ly/dry48) on NASCAR, gender, and the ludicrous future possibilities of cheap artificial intelligence.

## Mechanically

Structurally, the *Extranet* now requires *vastly* less rigmarole to maintain, and I think you’ll agree that our visual presence has matured dynamically. The recent juncture of these two paths of progress has allowed our look to establish itself as a still-unique, but much more consistent value. In accompaniment to [last month](http://bit.ly/freq13)’s addition of our [new masthead](http://extratone.com/masthead), I have begun adding bold bespoke bylines for each contributor with custom color and social link options, which are much more effective - I think - in showing how proud I am of each of them.
