# Mr. Butterball

[ ] The videos - always begun late and I had no face. 
[ ] The document - thinking within the dream that this would make a good short story. *I have several times before tried to begin this document*.
[ ] Awoke in my mother’s house, but not quite - houses farther apart, a more suburban street, the side of a hill not the bottom, and a cart carrying trash to the curb.
[ ] The butterball name.
[ ] The likable, ugly toddler son with spiky blonde hair who would run and laugh, trip and cry - but attempt to get back up and continue running and laughing again comically quickly. 
[ ] The original setting: the large house lacking most furnishings, but occupied by an endless stream of people I vaguely recognized who I could not escape and it was the **ultimate entrapment** that permeated everything and truly made the nightmare. 

I have attempted to start this document several times before, but at first I could not quite hold my phone at the appropriate angle to type the title *Mr. Butterworth* … no, *Mr. Butterball.* When I finally got it out, it wasn’t formatted correctly and then it became apparent that this was not even the correct document, but a different one, which I was fucking with.

amidst my worst nightmare of all time, which I can only hope is not still happening.
