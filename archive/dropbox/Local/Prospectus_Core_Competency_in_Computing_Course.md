# Prospectus: Core Competency in Computing Course

## Abstract/Statement of Purpose

While the capability of consumer electronics has increased exponentially in the past decade, the conversation surrounding it has skirted fundamental guidelines of use, maintenance, and marketing doctrine, leaving much of the most basic relevant information to word-of-mouth myths and isms. A core competency course should seek to replace these with factual, practical knowledge on the optimal methods of purchasing, maintaining, and operating hardware and software from a reasonable, impartial perspective.
