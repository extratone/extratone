# Background
## *Agricultural Divide* Edition

*(alternative name suggestions more than welcome)*
The organic, ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù movement (or ‚Äúfad,‚Äù depending) is now unquestionably mainstream in 2017. We have witnessed the hippy ‚Äúrise to power‚Äù as children and grandchildren of baby boomers. Organic or ‚Äúalternative‚Äù food goods are now commonplace in middle-class households. It has become admirable (even pious) to invest attention in the source of one‚Äôs food, again. 

By contrast, the vast majority of agricultural labor is still done by working-class and lower-middle class individuals, harvesting herbicide-saturated GMO crop, assisted by anhydrous ammonia. 

In my experience (which is dated some 10+ years, mind you,) organic and traditional farmers have virtually 0 consistent dialogue with each other, and live in relative ignorance of one another‚Äôs respective lifestyles. Misconceptions abound on both sides - particularly about yields and general revenue. The few local organic farmers I know seem to have no interest in reaching beyond their own spheres, regardless of how genuine their investment in furthering a ‚Äúsustainable‚Äù agricultural future. Where‚Äôs this project headed?


## Research
- [Glossary of Agricultural Jargon](https://agclass.nal.usda.gov/glossary_az.shtml)
- The gap between the organic/sustainable culture and *actual* farmers - that is, the individuals who harvest the vast majority of the world‚Äôs crop.
- "I‚Äôve never seen a *farmer* at the farmer‚Äôs market.‚Äù
- Of course, **what I‚Äôm really referring to here is a class divide**. TBD how much or little this needs mentioning.
