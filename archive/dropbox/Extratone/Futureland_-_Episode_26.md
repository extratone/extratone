[+üí°Thoughts on Mastodon](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Thoughts-on-Mastodon-MKSDW19drNKyXlYXrJoFY) 

## Eugen

Between the night of our first emails to the time of our interview, his [mastadon.social](http://mastodon.social) instance has doubled in users. Less than two hours after we said our goodbye's, his name was on [*The Verge*](http://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15177856/mastodon-social-network-twitter-clone)'s front page, just under the new iPad review.

## The Design

Twitter has just [integrated](http://www.theverge.com/2017/3/30/15115290/twitter-replies-redesign-character-limit) the feature they [announced](https://blog.twitter.com/express-even-more-in-140-characters) last Spring that exempts @ names from the 140-character limit in replies along with media links, which came [first](https://blog.twitter.com/express-even-more-in-140-characters), in Fall. 

Mastodon, however, allows ‚ÄúToots‚Äù to contain up to **500 characters**. Academically, a writer is measured by his/her [brevity](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/brevity), which - on Twitter - is not optional. This has been a primary complaint regarding the service for nearly its entire lifetime. As a longtime user, I‚Äôve always resisted increasing the cap because I believe it - and the purely linear timeline - to be the main pillars of Twitter‚Äôs identity. Perhaps to their credit, the company has found ways of ‚Äôtweaking‚Äô core features with (annoyingly-default) options and selections. I can still maintain a ‚Äôpure‚Äô linear timeline if I remember to check my settings periodically for additions of default-on filters and/or privacy tools.

The hard limit has also encouraged (or *forced*, perhaps) me to become a more deliberate and concise writer. 

That said, a simple open-source clone of Twitter would be awfully redundant, but it‚Äôs worth asking - **is more heavily user-influenced design as potent as we‚Äôd like to think it is?**

The question of *whether or not we actually know what we want* is probably too abstract for the context, but I don't think some diminutive of it would be unviable.

## The Future

Social services are always idyllic in the beginning because the prime majority of original users are genuinely motivated & rewarded enough by socializing to circumvent obscurity and cumbrous experiences. (Though Mastodon‚Äôs seems impressively well-flushed.)

The same incentive keeps them engaging in pro-social, pro-discourse behavior and discourages abuse because functioning human beings are intrinsically avoidant of isolation, no? 

I'm only stating old news because it prompts a question: **how high would the barrier-to-entry have to be, really, to culture a userbase of majority interested parties?**

What sort of requisite would make toxicity uneconomical?

Could it be as simple as... **a paywall**?
