“Here we are,” I think to myself, sitting solemnly in my office. At my side is a seemingly-endless supply of coffee and an open bottle of wine. My pack of cigarettes has just been opened, but without a doubt it will be empty by the end of the night. 

“Here we are.” I think again, correcting myself this time: “Here I am.” 

Because it’s no longer we, it’s I. Tonight, May 29th, 2017, I am tasked with something I never anticipated having to do. Here I am, writing an obituary for someone I’ve always considered a close friend, and potential literary rival, my own editor: David Blue. 

Knowing that David would obviously prefer something longform (and heartfelt) as opposed to a short, emotionally devoid paragraph that ultimately mutters, “Gee, I **guess** we’ll miss him?” I’m opting for something closer to an eulogy, despite not being able to make it to his actual funeral. It feels more personal.*

*also, his bank account is wiring me money to write this. So.

Although he has not yet had his ashes spread from aboard his favorite vessel, the U.S.S. Iowa, our former editor doesn’t have the option to roll in his grave due to me listening to what he’d refer to as “white music” as I write this. Note, dear Extratone readers, that Dave himself was a white man. We can pray that his spirit won’t be too offended by me listening to The Shins on this difficult night.

When I received the news earlier this afternoon, I wondered how I should start this eulogy of sorts. How does one start something like this? “Well, we at ET sure will miss the guy!” simply doesn’t work. It should be noted, folks, that his departure is effectively the end of Extratone. I mean, who’s reading if Dave isn’t? 

I decided to investigate by asking the people who knew David the best. When it comes down to it, the staff of Extratone weren’t who interacted with him the most (aside from Senior Culture Editor, Leo Marx.) I spent the afternoon tracking down the folks who were major figures in his life, including an ensemble of his exes, his family, and his close friends from school.

quote from Jab, Extratone contributor:
“As David broke a $600 mic by screaming into it the first time I ever met him, I wasn't sure if he was super chill or his mind was in an alternate hell he created himself. I've been apart of the team ever since and he somehow still thinks the number 50 is apart of my legal name. I almost got in some deep trouble during tax returns as 50 was written on my extratone taxes. As my accountant contacted him he just shouted "It's 2017 numbers can be a name now" and as a result I am not allowed to say I work with him. Luckily I'm allowed to create the facade that I still do, by showing up to a few meetings and even site projects, but all I'm really doing is re-saying what David forgot he said when he was banging on my door to give him a key to the office. (Extratone has no office). I think he died while drunk driving on the way back to what he thought was his office but was really an unused lot in a strip mall. Either way, David was definitely something else.”

quote from Isiah, Extratone contributor:
“David sure was a boss. A boss that didn't understand time, holidays, or pay. David was a boss that didn't. He is certainly dead and something will miss him, maybe.”

quote from IWHHR (Individual Whom Has Had Relations)
“Looks like him and the jag finally took their worst turn! Always thought he would blow up in some awful, somewhat self-inflicted car explosion. I’d imagine the car briskly, with just dumb amount of speed, catapulting off of a ginormous cliff. And to that i hope he was not drinking and driving. But on the possibly probable occasion that he was drinking and driving intoxicated i do so hope he bought something classy that cost him. 
Live fast, die.”
