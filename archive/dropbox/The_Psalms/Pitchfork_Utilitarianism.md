# AMPHETAMINE COUNT: ???
## Our experience and aftermath of the Pitchfork Music Festival and some pretentious, ink-spending ramblings on existence, free-of-charge.

Hey, you shits. I’m a bit drunk, and my editor’s letter is *assuredly* going to be late, as I may or may not have explained in my last letter. (Who knows what I’m actually doing anymore?)

The truth is, a bit of my adderall was stolen this month, which is actually more sad and disappointing than infuriating, in context, but it’s a story that’d be neither relevant nor interesting to you.


Eryn and I are back from Pitchfork - the acclaimed music festival thrown by *That Indie-As-Fuck Powerhouse* which I never thought I’d find myself at. Our friendship was tested - mostly due to my utter lack of energy and subsequent tendency to sleep *everywhere*, but her cousin and his wife were the most accommodating (and Cool As All Hell) hosts I’ve experienced in my twenty-three years. For better or worse, their lifestyle led us to spend the majority of our time wondering aloud about Columbia and Columbians, and how - exactly - they and it got *so utterly mediocre.*

Cherry Glazerr - the main act we came to see, thanks to Eryn’s fan devotion (and my own, by proxy,) was absolutely magical, along with Dirty Projectors, who were just… mystifying and odd. If you recall, the acts I knew, myself, included just Danny Brown, Madlib, and A Tribe Called Quest - all three of which were satisfyingly odd choices to book for such an event. As expected, Danny was ultra-weird (I was asleep for most of his set, to Eryn’s chagrin,) Madlib is still alive???, along with ATCQ, though I was too asleep to actually *show up at all* for their set, which closed day 2.

Oddly enough, the show I saw that most moved me wasn’t within the festival at all, but in a delightfully intimate venue across the river called Schubas. The bands we caught were *Deeper*, and *Priest*, who both brought out from within me a rambunctiousness akin to that which I occasionally manifested in Ye Olde High School Punk days - jumping around and such.

The Greyhound, though, presented the steepest trial to our friendship and sanity. It turns out that - while one *can* cross a good chunk of the country via bus for just $30 (or less, depending on how early he/she/they order their tickets) - one cannot do so *pleasantly*, by any reasonable standard. This isn’t the appropriate medium to voice my complaints, necessarily (nor do I have the energy or will to do so,) but suffice it to say… it was very stressful and uncomfortable. But! It would seem our friendship has survived, thankfully.

We also watched the 2015, iPhone-shot *Tangerine*, which utterly defied all expectations and deserves a watch *as soon as possible*. (It’s on Netflix at the moment.) *And!* I sent Nevermore off to *The Shop* again, today - hopefully, this once will be *it* after some $3000 and who-knows-how-many days, but I am tremendously excited to once again have *a supercar* with *working brakes*! I suspect it shall return some integral part of me that has been fading away with its poor, neglected chassis these past few years.

I’m going to conclude this letter with a few excerpts from the shit I’ve been writing with my new Kaweco (mainly to run out the godawful ink cartridge that came with it.) I take particular pride in “rampantly premature satisfaction.”

----------

To give ___ a chance; I did - I shall, I promise.

As and when it fouls to grotesqueness, I will not shy away - I will be a witness to it all, in clarity and diligence. While we disembody all the ways that made us, and chastise them as crude. While our own complexity shimmers - a mirage in alabaster sun. Inherent values are fleeting, but at least it will be seen and known because I see and know it.

In finality, I am the breeze - imperceptibly swaying the leaves; wise for all time, come: history, whispered. Gallantry, sung.

----------

Surely, this is the beginning of our end - a perpetual cliche that refuses to cease its maniacal, eternal ticking. Imagine all the ink ever spent pouting, lying, finagling, and justifying; rationalizing a knowingly-malicious end. Imagine the human time - measured in heartbeats, if you’d like - spent aching, wondering, seeing, and wanting for ingraspable nothings, while smaller lives are lived their whole breadth, precipitation is jostled around the globe, and the sun burns out a little more.

It’s in these bouts that we *create* - insist upon ourselves for a legacy that may very well mean nothing to the cosmos, and - even if it will, certainly - can give nothing substantial to the suffering souls of the moment. Lament, despair - mark it all down for an unlikely audience that will be unable to make any pragmatic use of one’s own destruction of his pride.

----------

I am relatively steadfast in my wisdom - asking little, giving much, but occasionally perturbable as to the issue of my own wants. The fact that it still startles me to not know completely after all this time is laughable. Or - it would be, were there any foreseeable end to my wondering. I know that I must find a home in people (or, one) because - it would seem - that I have none, otherwise. (Or, at least - my perception of *home* is for now immovable - bent in such a way.)

I would hope it’s relatively obvious that I am aware of the *unhealthiness* of the practice, but only out of pride, which has been both a savior and a terrible curse to myself and those I love, with age, as I would imagine it has, is, and will be for many of my species. In general, lately, it has been repeatedly brought to my attention - the foul consequence of my lifestyle on my person, but I cannot help but decry such sentiments - outright, anyway - as tainted by the particular lens of *this place*. This stagnant place of unbridled contentment and rampantly premature satisfaction. 

Of course, I’ve been able to reconcile with the bizarre state of the Columbian yokel thanks to logical reasoning that can be extracted (more often, extrapolated) from observation of them and their quaint, petty joys in contrast to the utterly destitute dystopia building around them. Try as I might, though, I cannot find similar joys, here, and am hemorrhaging my capacity to be amused with them at an alarming rate. (My best friend says it’s *dumb* to believe I’ll “never” join them in their happiness, but I can say that such is true as long as I bear any resemblance to my current self.)

Yes, I can see how bitter and condescending it is to speak this way, but it is honest, and that is why I must escape as soon as possible for my own sanity and the wellbeing of those around me. 

That said, the sources of the criticism of my current way of being have now become those few I trust and know, positively, to be exempt from the ideas of *The Middle*. This fact, along with the rapidly fading “necessity” of my current pace (in alcohol, amphetamines, SSRIs, nicotine, etc) should be more than adequate justification to give me pause, yet… it has not, really.

I don’t lust for anything of my time, particularly, and sense - despite *dumb* - that I will not, again. Recently, I blurted out a concise and unfortunately less-melodramatic-than-it-sounds summary of this sensation: *everything I love is dead.*

Naturally, it felt quite juvenile to say such a sentence at my age, and yes - I was standing in the middle of a desperately silent, unmanned local runway - but it does not feel dishonest, especially given that it’s retained its despair for me, as opposed to some vain, satisfactory sense of theater.

It’s not as if I don’t have more than I’ve ever had, though: real, tangible empathy, a kind of mission, an old Jaguar to adore, a real relationship with my family, and one who knows and loves me for the correct reasons - who’s *really* heard me, and will miss me when I die.

As is the nature of wealth, I was impossibly unaware of how much I lacked until I had to face (and apparently survive) my crucible.

It’s funny - and perhaps quite obviously hormonal - how much I appear to be concerned with my legacy. Astrologically, it’s explained by my moon in Leo - my insatiable desire to produce as much *good work* - whatever that happens to mean at the time - as I can before I perceive no more, but it’s hard to leave there. Perhaps - ironically - for the same reason.

In terms of making use of it all so that some may take a more ideal path - my other noteworthy compulsion - I’ve been repeatedly and uncharacteristically stumped. Correctly or not, it’s uncomfortable to suggest that one of a lesser age listen more to the incessant ambient platitudes we hear throughout childhood than I did, but - in my case, at least - too many have had to be discovered as irritatingly wise. I *can* tell you with certainty that it is unwise to neglect one’s *only* real chance to form a bond with nature, distraction-free, which is - of course - youth. I will have to live with the consequences of my own for a long time to come. Perhaps even my whole stint, and nobody likes to play catch-up in the public eye.

I can also tell you that studies of the philosophical and ethical schools - while important in an academic, exploratory sense - should (and generally, do) give way to a simple creed: *be reasonable*. I had to face my own death to reach this conclusion - to realize how fucking short it all is; how much I’ll lose and gain and want and fail, regardless, and how much general hassle it saves to focus the intellectual energy I once allocated to abstracts manifested of these to developing my ability to *listen*, which includes - to no small extent - the ability to make myself *want* to listen.
