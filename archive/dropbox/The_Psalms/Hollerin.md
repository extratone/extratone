# AMPHETAMINE COUNT: 50+
## Learning how to pull back on the throttle a bit.

Before I go *too* far off the edge, here are a few relevant announcements:

◍ Eryn and I will be attending the [Pitchfork Music Festival](http://pitchfork.com/festival/chicago/) in Chicago, this month with 90% certainty. Cherry Glazerr, A Tribe Called Quest, Danny Brown, and *fuckin Madlib???????* The second and last of these likely representing once-in-a-lifetime opportunities, I’d wager.

◍ It’s been two weeks since I [lost my $1100 glasses](http://www.extratone.com/psalms/waxed/) like A Fucking Toddler, and the situation is looking rather grim. Sleep deprivation can really tank your vision, so I’m Actually Blind, now.

◍ The photos you’ve seen [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/879910530810494976)/this letter/[the frontpage](http://extratone.com/june26) of Eryn & Paul looking ethereally Adorable As Hell will be edited over the course of the next few days and published in [*The Little House*](http://extratone.com/littlehouse) as I go. (Pretty sure the above image is the best photograph I’ve ever taken.) I’m also thinking about revisiting the prospect of installing more complex gallery software, thanks to these. Perhaps you won’t have to look at Fucking Google to see them, soon.

◍ Isiah’s delivered another *very* entertaining [bit](http://bit.ly/isiahyelp) on Yelp! (Yes, it still fucking exists.)

◍ Nevermore is still inoperable, but - after spending an afternoon in the Ricky jeans Just Jacking Around, I managed to get it up on ramps without any actual fore-or-aft motion (yes, the brakes are *that* frozen,) impressing myself, and dislodging a profound realization: it is *so much fucking easier* to work on cars when you have zero regard for your own safety. Without my Tropish Risky Grief, there’s no way I would’ve managed to do what I did.

◍ I have decided to place real effort into reassimilating the term “outfit” - as to describe groups/organizations - into my vocabulary.

*Eryn and I have been driving around a lot, and it’s made me realize how much I needed to relax.*

Tired of reading/hearing that, yet?

Well, now we have something to show for it. 

◍ The podcast I’ve been espousing the past few letters has finally happened - here’s [Episode 1](http://bit.ly/rdadguns) of [*Runnin’ Down a Dream*](http://extratone.com/dream)*.* I’ve been excited to see how she and I actually work together for like… a year, now, and it would seem we can talk well on tape, at least. I think Maddie’s participation will end up adding *a lot*.

I’ve been fairly good about not revising these, but I have *revisited* them a bit - though not a fraction of how much I go back to my *flagship* stuff (which is good) - and I’ve noticed a particular habit of separating more profound/abstract articulations from the voice with which I write to you now. This is definitely the result of a year of *new media* focus, and it may benefit my vanity in the long term, but it’s often felt like an obstruction. And yes… these days, I’m not so sure my entire creative motive has not always simply been *vanity.*

If so, it’s good that I switched my energy’s focus to purveying more relevant voices instead of the development of my own. Perhaps enslavement of it is not the most productive form its company could take, but it’s what I know right now.

Perhaps because of my steps back, I’ve perceived an increase in (good-intentioned) criticism of my lifestyle from family & friends, which is certainly preferable to the alternative - an absence of all attention or rhetoric. (It sounds dramatic, but it’s *not* a good place to be.) I am thankful to have finally formed friendships that encourage care and support.

I was here, a year ago, when Eryn moved in to her peculiar little one-room house across from an outer-downtown industrial park, and I sat and watched her pack up the last of it, yesterday. In so many ways, it was her that first taught me how to be any sort of emotionally substantial friend, all in the relatively short span of her occupation, here.

Of course, I think I “knew” the basics, but was just beginning to realize how much more it’s about *choosing* to behave a certain way, or strive for a certain role, than it is about any *inevitable happening*. Recently, the participants in my own particular social enterprises have noted (independently, for the most part) that I *treat [my]self badly*, and I’ve realized, quite suddenly, that I am stumped by the challenge of exploring alternatives to this behavior. After The Big Happening and its intermittent shockwaves over the past two years, I am left in ignorance as to what it means to *treat [my]self well.*

Most of man’s life is spent burrowed in stuffy session within his Mind’s High Court, deliberating the fundamentals - and later in his life, the nuances - of His Hates and Wants, but then again… we are borned with abject confidence in our ever-less-rudimentary system of desire that - by fate - erodes steadily. A prime component of our *healthy* ideal is the capability to eventually redesign the function of our Self’s wanter in such a way that it interfaces with our environment effectively - in as sophisticated and *extratordinary* ‘a’ style as we can possibly muster. 

As much as I’d like to think myself above hyperlinking you to nice ‘n’ fluffy thinkpiece listicles, [this dainty dissection](https://medium.com/personal-growth/david-foster-wallace-how-to-create-a-life-of-meaning-and-awareness-d75920f5b4db) of a few of David Foster Wallace’s essential insights is one of these with tangible, significant value.

This one, especially, is *so* profoundly relevant and personally resonant. It’s one of the prime arguments I am regularly compelled to contribute to, and shall forever remain a Hot Topic for me - especially when 40-something white people fall into that *no, I really don’t care about what anyone thinks of me, and I’m especially proud to have achieved this condition of total absence from life after years of wiping the sweat off my brow.*

Congrats, Dad & adolescent me - you’re fucking dead. Eat Rocks.

Have you ever noticed how much of our time and energy we ultimately spend in the pursuit of **controlling the way we feel**?

Even the most forgettable cliches and platitudes about *the future* & *desire* are inescapably nested (technically) in your ability to influence the volume of dopamine your brain will absorb per hour, and - through my grief, PTSD, and depression - I’ve gotten pretty fucking proficient at it.

Adderall, SSRIs, nicotine, taurine, caffeine… Until last summer, it’d been years since I endured *any* significant time in an undesirable state. The extent of my emotional function of the time was well below the threshold managed by the most superficial of drugs - adderall, cocaine, and alcohol. Thanks to these, I managed to live the entirety of 2015 without feeling much of anything. 

I stayed mildly inebriated at all times and would just simply… take 20mg of adderall at the first sign of fatigue or stagnancy, often skipping two or three nights so that I wouldn’t ever need to wait through 5-12 hours of comedown to sleep - the force of the exhaustion would take me straight away. Interestingly enough, cocaine never *actually* became a part of my life, and I’ve somehow managed to keep my substance abuse entirely legal (and I’m not just stating that for the record.)

*If I remember correctly, I spent like… 18 hours recording conversations with various folks for* Drycast*’s* [*48th episode*](http://bit.ly/dry48)*, drinking all day, perhaps making it another effective audio encapsulation of my life at the time, should you* ***really*** *desire the experience. It also contained perhaps the second or third most entertaining 15 minutes of the show’s duration, which I’ve* [*clipped*](https://clyp.it/gyfedw4n) *for your enjoyment.*

Since, I’ve taken several prolonged respites from this lifestyle, but I ended up making use of the same pattern of adderall intake, drinking, and regimented sleep deprivation to make it through the past year as I built *Extratone*, as you might’ve guessed from the quantity of distress I’ve expressed* monthly in my [Editor’s Letters](http://extratone.com/freq).

And I’ve probably mentioned in nearly every one of these how unnatural I’ve felt during the process, but… *it’s done*. I mean, never *totally*, obviously, but the fundamentals are now in place. Mechanically, it requires a tiny fraction of the attention I’ve grown accustomed to spending on it, but it seems like I’ve been living at the same pace. 

Where has all that speed been going?

Well, I’m not quite sure, but I know that my task, now, is to explore a slightly slower way of living.
