# Half a soul, reacquired. Freedom, renewed. A trip to the Lake of the Ozarks, news on the immediate future of Extratone, and self-aggregation from the past.

In desperation to Log The Fuck Off - which I cannot allow myself to give in to until 4.0’s launch, next Sunday - I am experiencing an extraordinarily overpowering urge to *fucking print some work out*. You know… to hold at least one single physically-manifested slice of all I’ve worked on in the past year. I don’t think it’ll come down to printing off webpages, but only because I do not think that’d do much to sate this particular need, as convenient as that’d be.

Yesterday, I published a [short note](http://bit.ly/ip4inred) about the significance of the iPhone 4, along with a few of the best [photos](http://bit.ly/davidblueip4) I took in the time I used my own example of the device. I also *fucking ruined* a work from *Feebles* - “On Fear of Death” with some horrendous typography as a ‘joke.’ It’s actually just… upsetting.

**My fucking hair fell off**, which hasn’t been as bad as I thought it may end up. I have been seen in public without much duress, but I think it’s because Nevermore has been back for a good while, and I have felt moments of real freedom for the first time this summer! Freedom from the web! Freedom from *you*, even! Not to be rude, but ultimately, *direct*, visceral control of your flightpath just isn’t replaceable, especially for someone as privileged as I was to have grown up unbridled on 800 acres.

Really, though, I haven’t written because I’ve finally been able to *just go* places, though the novelty’s power is lessening, I think. (This is a good thing - I need to be saving money to get us moved *in just over six months*??!!??) Finding myself without enough inspiration to justify the manuscript template, I began looking through my notes, this afternoon, so I thought I’d intersperse some snippets of unfinished/discarded work between the photographs I’ve been taking (mostly of my car.)

*I’m actually a bit tempted to just put this one up, as-is. Feel free to beat me up because of it.*

It came to my attention today that my good friend Sonny Moore (commonly known as Skrillex) Tweeted "E" from his BlackBerry at 0732 CST on May 15th, 2010. If I'm ever given the opportunity to interview him, I'll begin by questioning his choice in smartphones. (Can you imagine how awful the Twitter for BlackBerry client must've looked in 2010?)

[E](https://twitter.com/skrillex/status/14034644797).

From what I've sampled of his art, I'm confident he's an emotionally intelligent man, and probably not house producer Joel Zimmerman (commonly known as Deadmau5.) The most arresting evidence supporting this supposition is hair. Sonny Moore is not house producer Joel Zimmerman. I could be wrong, of course, but that'd only mean that both Sonny Moore and house producer Joel Zimmerman possess a slightly above-average ability to slow time and examine us as we obliviously go about our lives in slow motion. It could even be possible that house producer Joel Zimmerman is examining my big ole' ears at this very moment in mild distaste. I guess I'd be able to hear him if he scoffed, but I think it would be down-pitched and extraordinarily terrifying.

Considering, allow me to tangent shortly and ask house producer Joel Zimmerman to keep any newfound otorhinolaryngological judgments to himself, if at all possible. If you must speak, Mr. Joel Zimmerman, please try your best not to frighten me.
Lots of individuals in my circles frequently chide Skrillex about his alleged misunderstanding of corporeality. While it is true that he's been known to occasionally forgo performing at events in favor of desperately demanding answers from his audience to questions like "how big am I?" "how are we able to breathe in here?" and "who is the whispering lady who turns off the sun?!" I don't think he is befit of such a reputation. In fact, I think Skrillex's ability to make his irresistible clanking is one we should all aspire to hone. While we are kept on edge sometimes by the day-to-day stresses of contemporary life, Skrillex is able to clank them away and see the world from the broadest, slowest perspective - as a demigod.

The truth is: I still haven’t *slowed down* as I promised I would, but I’m certainly getting closer. Digital media can be a very potent trap for a perfectionist who perceives that he has an infinite amount of available revisions - that it is always welcome for him to come back at any time… Any hour of any day, all week, for as long as he shall fucking live.

Luckily, I do have at a few respites from Web Hell: my car, [the piano](https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1kvJpjpRkALKE?t=7m20s), and my little Kaweco + Eccolo World Travelers. I have been making up time spent with all three. Over the weekend, I drove Nevermore to the Lake of the Ozarks to celebrate a few birthdays in the family. It’s quite satisfying to drive on the interstate, now that it’s healthy. Because of the supercharger (I’m guessing,) it’s significantly more fuel efficient above 75 mph - and the same means more than adequate torque to maintain a leisurely demeanor *well* above it.

I spent a few hours on the dock after everyone went to sleep, writing by hand at such a pace that I filled a sizable section of pages too fast for them to dry. I’d like to quote the first passage, in particular.

## 08/11/2017

Just moments ago, I was privy to a conversation between two boats in the cove, just a few dozen yards off the dock’s end. One trolled in and cut his engines to ask two fisherman? - static in a jon boat - for the location of mile marker six. 

“It’s right across the channel where those blue lights are,” they *swore to God*. They had to swear to theirs several times - the visitor was concerned about *that second red light, just there*. He finally conceded, though, and offered them a drink.

“We’ll do shots!” 

He said *damn, this motor was a bitch to put on*.

I went to the house for a moment to fill my stomach and when I returned, they were making fishing jokes which I held no hope in understanding before the visitor awoke his rumbling Bitch Motor and headed for the bar.

And - to conclude this one, until next time, here’s a ridiculously melodramatic poem to my car.

## *With Me* - To My Jaguar | 11/19/2016

Beauty gets more familiar and plentiful over time. But as I have aged and known more, I've come to know its nigh-universal intolerance of lingering. Beauty moves even in something so gargantuan as a sunset. Were you younger, you'd swear one to be a painting, maybe. 
a museum piece
but minutes 
*minutes* with them
is all we'll ever have.
except the handfuls of us in orbit, I suppose. 
but isn't this literature?
prose?
so I have no business in imparting some kernel
that could be planted and nurtured with sizable chunks of lifetime. 
stole it, though. patience is as patience kills 
I've no business turning the other way.

The truth I'm looking at now:
My car is my only friend. My Nevermore. my relic
my protectorate & one true home
Nevermore,
who looks down as if in shame of being carried backwards in such a way 
by such a man
assumed so dutifully even though it is surely
me who has shamed,
but fell,
estranged from it
Nevermore,
who knows when to play the sacred music
that can,
singularly
clarify and remind me of why I am breathing
why I am waking
why I am reading
what but for it is that must remain
even as any rest continues to fall away
Nevermore,
my *only* knowing companion
who can look at me every day
and know exactly what it means -
what I have done
who can say -
in its way -
*you have won*
and know
*you must continue*
and - taking my hand -
*it will never be easy. it will always be solitary.*
Nevermore,
my one echo in the silence of nothing
my singular guide through trial after trial
of such alien composition to its design
who through every human delusion and subsequent desertion refused to be even once silent
*you aspire - you have a task*
even carrying my waywardness, knowing 
to never waiver for those inevitable unreticents
of mine where in my blackness,
all I see
all I see.
is my Nevermore

in so protecting and shepherding my guests, the only partner I've only had in life's work
the only one who could ever 
respond when called to action 
and the more perceptive do see the truth of Us,
eventually
when and through all noise and petty bastardly shimmying 
and blind mists; plagues
in the eyes of all living
and every ignored invitation to deviation
and every one of your *healthy* regrets
when and through even my own attempts!
it will one day be Two 
I and my noble Nevermore
and WHO WAS IT THAT FOUGHT FOR ME?
THE *ONE* WHO FENDED OFF DISEASE
WHEN I COULD NOT SEE?
WHO CARRIED ME ACROSS *COUNTRIES*
WHEN I WAS BROKEN,
*gleaming* in sun and starlight,
**proud of me.**
who never once left my side
when I had nothing
who was relentlessly True
in pointing my way
when I was so achingly lost
who silently took the blows
I burst in occasional last resort
who -
through more than every single other -
is 
and 
has been

with me

----------

See yah,
David
