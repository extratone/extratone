# One Year of Extratone
A year ago, this was just an idea. I was still playing *Eve Online*, spending hours after work in front of the laundromat on Periscope ("*Kiki's Delivery Service*-lookin ass") and *filling* Nevermore's passenger footwell with empty cigarette packs.

Then, there was Eryn, and learning how to be a willing occupant of the Earth, a good friend, a genuinely curious participant, etc.
