# Quickest Boys

## 24 Hours of David & Tim.

I’m going out of order. There’s a letter waiting for you called *Get Waxed*, which is contrary to the point of the whole thing, I suppose, but *who cares.*

The 24 Hours of Le Mans is happening, now, and it’s quite important to me. Tim and I have made it a tradition - this year, he’s hosting our ‘party’ in his new apartment. It’s down to just the two of us, which is okay with me, honestly.

It’s difficult to communicate to the uninitiated why this event is so enchanting. I’ve tried - in writing - many ‘a’ time, but have never really arrived upon anything worth publication. 

Put simply - it’s a journey. If you choose to imbue yourself with the culture and the pressures of the challenges (from a distance, most likely,) for the duration, you find yourself tied to the drivers, mechanics, and commentators who perpetuate this… happening. 

It’s fascinating that we choose to do this to ourselves, isn’t it? Spend our lives, money, and sanity hurling howling machines thousands of miles around and around. The answer is even more so: we gain something from it. Somehow, there is spiritual and mental fortitude formed in this imbecilic endeavor. For me, it’s in brotherhood - perhaps my first opportunities to experience that which is quite essential in the development of a young man. Fraternity and camaraderie - all that *macho* jazz. 

I’d shied away from it because I’d seen it only represented by insane form - the *Promise Keepers*, for instance - an absurdly middle-age extension of AAA, theologized & merchandised to hell. If your father was a protestant, relatively post-alcoholism 50-something in the 90s, chances are that he flirted with it. Don’t go looking for the CDs though - they’re less interesting than you might imagine.

Perhaps it’s the science (or just my agnostic elitism) that makes the motorsport flavor of Dadism *okay.* That’s why these dorks are blessed, in my book, and why I’ll make an effort to get together with My Quick Boys every year to witness the *24 Heures du Mans.*
