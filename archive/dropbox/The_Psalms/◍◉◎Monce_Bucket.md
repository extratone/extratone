Yeah, I’m not quite sure how we went through so much adderall so quickly, either, but I’m not worried about it, for whatever reason, despite having claimed to be “learning how to pull back on the throttle a bit” in my [last letter](http://bit.ly/psalmsholla).

## ◍◉◎ Shall we develop a system? 

All three mean “I want to die.”

◉ Isiah’s short [investigative Steam child abduction story](http://bit.ly/isiahhale) represents our first step into cyberjournalism. At least the crowd and I always seem to get a kick out of it.

◉ I wrote another [week-ending accompaniment](http://bit.ly/thejunction2) to Sunday’s newsletter and figured [its own section](http://extratone.com/junction) may make sense fairly soon.
*Note: I am now technically aggregating the aggregator of my aggregator.*

◉ I restored the [HP Spectre story](http://bit.ly/spectreinred) in which I declare “Dillard’s is the second best place to lose your mind in America” and refer to a Best Buy employee as “Zoroaster.”

◉ I finally got around to establishing a basic template for bespoke bylines.

◉ I remembered the title to the [*filthy*](https://youtu.be/UWriT_lYgck) [Ike Turner record](https://youtu.be/UWriT_lYgck) that I became obsessed with Junior year of high school after hearing it sampled in “[Concrete Schoolyard](https://youtu.be/VpRyJ0-3n3c),” and discovered that I can still (cringingly) rap the entirety of Chali 2na’s verses.

◉ I have cracked my phone, badly.

◉ It’s confirmed: I will be at Chicago’s Pitchfork Music Festival in two weeks.

In late Spring, I opened my first bank account in ages as part of my attempts to self-train for future *duties to investors*, and whatnot. (Isn’t the “*and whatnot”* thing irritating?) There was a young teller present for the process (I think she was in training,) so - because it’s *Fucking David Blue* - I spent the whole time cracking heavily self-deprecating media jokes, all the while espousing the subscription model and portraying my decisions as *gigantic* and *ideological*. 

Milking the Peter Pan thing, essentially.

When I went in to deposit a check yesterday, she helped me and somehow immediately recalled enough to ask intelligent questions about *how it’s goin*, which is encouraging, and follows a late theme of significantly intensified general interest in *Extratone*. I met a 20-something writer named Trey a few nights ago who smoked and talked with me at three in the morning for some 45 minutes about… me. 

As much as I’ve told my *story*, unsolicited, I’ve found myself sounding unprepared, when asked, which makes it all look a bit less vain, at least. It can be frustrating in the context of a formal interview.

I ran into an English teacher from Rock Bridge High School (Columbia’s white drywall, middle-upper class alternative to Hickman, where I went) who expressed an interest in scheduling me for a guest ‘lecture’ or just… visiting, which would likely be embarrassingly enjoyable for me, though I can’t imagine it *actually* happening.

Tim’s acquired a white Taurus from the dopey/aquatic era, and has - naturally - somehow made it a stylistically acceptable automobile with his presence, alone. On Sunday, he came over to drink beer and help me “work” on getting Nevermore’s starter off, finally, but - thanks to His Googling - we discovered that there is, in fact, *another* mounting bolt that is *actually* inaccessible, so it looks like I’m going to be paying/begging someone more capable with the Crooks & Crannies to come to the house and finish the job. Or - as Tim suggested - I could just sawzall it off. Imagine turning in a dozen salami-style starter slices for the rebate…

Against all reason, I have borrowed Tess Gallagher’s *Moon Crossing Bridge*, and have been consuming as much of it as I can handle, daily - which is something like 1-3 works. Her articulation of the intricacies of *that particular grief* is so thorough that I cry every time.

I have also begun Hemingway’s [*A Farewell to Arms*](https://archive.org/stream/farewelltoarms01hemi/farewelltoarms01hemi_djvu.txt) **(I was pleasantly puzzled by the copy I found in my closet.) Without knowing enough to expect anything, the experience has been refreshing. Of course it’s not about the war (I don’t think,) but its setting is somewhat nostalgic for me. *All I did* as a child was read about the World Wars.

I found Chapter VI especially entertaining, so I’ve included most of it.

I was away for two days at the posts. When I got 
home it was too late and I did not see Miss Barkley 
until the next evening. She was not in the garden and 
I had to wait in the office of the hospital until she came 
down. There were many marble busts on painted 
wooden pillars along the walls of the room they used 
for an office. The hall too, that the office opened on, 
was lined with them. They had the complete marble 
quality of all looking alike. Sculpture had always 
seemed a dull business — still, bronzes looked like some- 
thing. But marble busts all looked like a cemetery. 
There was one fine cemetery though — the one at Pisa. 
Genoa was the place to see the bad marbles. This had 
been the villa of a very wealthy German and the busts 
must have cost him plenty. I wondered who had done 
them and how much he got. I tried to make out 
whether they were members of the family or what; but 
they were all uniformly classical. You could not tell 
anything about them. 

I sat on a chair and held my cap. We were supposed 
to wear steel helmets even in Gorizia but they were un- 
comfortable and too bloody theatrical in a town where 
the civilian inhabitants had not been evacuated. I wore 
one when we went up to the posts and carried an Eng- 
lish gas mask. We were just beginning to get some of 
them. They were a real mask. Also we were required 
to wear an automatic pistol ; even doctors and sanitary 
officers. I felt it against the back of the chair. 

You were liable to arrest if you did not have one worn in 
plain sight. Rinaldi carried a holster stuffed with toilet 
paper. I wore a real one and felt like a gunman until 
I practised firing it. It was an Astra 7.65 caliber with 
a short barrel and it jumped so sharply when you let it 
off that there was no question of hitting anything. I 
practised with it, holding below the target and trying to 
master the jerk of the ridiculous short barrel until I 
could hit within a yard of where I aimed at twenty 
paces and then the ridiculousness of carrying a pistol 
at all came over me and I soon forgot it and carried it 
flopping against the small of my back with no feeling at 
all except a vague sort of shame when I met English- 
speaking people. I sat now in the chair and an orderly 
of some sort looked at me disapprovingly from behind 
a desk while I looked at the marble floor, the pillars 
with the marble busts, and the frescoes on the wall 
and waited for Miss Barkley. The frescoes were not 
bad. Any frescoes were good when they started to peel 
and flake off. 

I saw Catherine Barkley coming down the hall, and 
stood up. She did not seem tall walking toward me but 
she looked very lovely. 

"Good-evening, Mr. Henry," she said. 

"How do you do?" I said. The orderly was listening 
behind the desk. 

"Shall we sit here or go out in the garden?" 

"Let's go out. It's much cooler." 

I walked behind her out into the garden, the orderly 
looking after us. When we were out on the gravel drive 
she said, "Where have you been?" 

"I've been out on post." 

"You couldn't have sent me a note?" 

"No” I said. "Not very well. I thought I was com- 
ing back." 

"You ought to have let me know, darling.”

We were off the driveway, walking under the trees. 
I took her hands, then stopped and kissed her. 

"Isn't there anywhere we can go?" 

"No," she said. "We have to just walk here. You've 
been away a long time." 

"This is the third day. But I'm back now." 

She looked at me, "And you do love me?" 

"Yes." 

"You did say you loved me, didn't you?" 

"Yes," I lied. "I love you." I had not said it 
before. 

"And you call me Catherine ?" 

"Catherine." We walked on a way and were stopped 
under a tree. 

"Say, I've come back to Catherine in the night.' " 

"I've come back to Catherine in the night." 

"Oh, darling, you have come back, haven't you?" 

"Yes." 

"I love you so and it's been awful. You won't go 
away?" 

"No. I'll always come back." 

"Oh, I love you so. Please put your hand there 
again." 

"It's not been away." I turned her so I could see her 
face when I kissed her and I saw that her eyes were 
shut. I kissed both her shut eyes. I thought she was 
probably a little crazy. It was all right if she was. I 
did not care what I was getting into. This was better 
than going every evening to the house for officers where 
the girls climbed all over you and put your cap on back- 
ward as a sign of affection between their trips upstairs 
with brother officers. I knew I did not love Catherine 
Barkley nor had any idea of loving her. This was a 
game, like bridge, in which you said things instead of 
playing cards. Like bridge you had to pretend you 
were playing for money or playing for some stakes. 
Nobody had mentioned what the stakes were. It was 
all right with me. 

"I wish there was some place we could go," I said. 
I was experiencing the masculine difficulty of making 
love very long standing up. 

"There isn't any place," she said. She came back 
from wherever she had been. 

"We might sit there just for a little while." 

We sat on the flat stone bench and I held Catherine 
Barkley's hand. She would not let me put my arm 
around her. 

"Are you very tired?" she asked. 

"No." 

She looked down at the grass. 

"This is a rotten game we play, isn't it?" 

"What game?" 

"Don't be dull." 

"I'm not, on purpose." 

"You're a nice boy," she said. "And you play it as 
well as you know how. But it's a rotten game." 

"Do you always know what people think?" 

"Not always. But I do with you. You don't have to 
pretend you love me. That's over for the evening. Is 
there anything you'd like to talk about?" 

"But I do love you." 

"Please let's not lie when we don't have to. I had 
a very fine little show and I'm all right now. You see
I'm not mad and I'm not gone off. It's only a little 
sometimes." 

I pressed her hand, "Dear Catherine." 

"It sounds very funny now — Catherine. You don't 
pronounce it very much alike. But you're very nice. 
You're a very good boy." 

"That's what the priest said." 

"Yes, you're very good. And you will come and see 
me?" 

"Of course." 

"And you don't have to say you love me. That's all 
over for a while." She stood up and put out her hand. 
"Good-night." 

I wanted to kiss her. 

"No," she said. "I'm awfully tired." 

"Kiss me, though," I said. 

"I'm awfully tired, darling." 

"Kiss me." 

"Do you want to very much?" 

"Yes." 

We kissed and she broke away suddenly. "No. 
Good-night, please, darling." We walked to the door 
and I saw her go in and down the hall. I liked to watch 
her move. She went on down the hall. I went on 
home. It was a hot night and there was a good deal 
going on up in the mountains. I watched the flashes 
on San Gabriele.

*This* is the sort of introductory introduction to a romance I would like to write in *my* fiction. Unfortunately, it’s not all that far away from the “romance” I’ve blundered through in the past two years. (Box grimace emoji.)

Eryn and I have watched *Tom and Huck* and *Prince of Egypt* in the past two days. The first is quite absurd, but it’s definitely one of the only on-screen adaptations of a Mark Twain story worth your time. I *must* have seen the latter as a child, but you’d think I would have remembered *something* from such a beautifully executed biblical tale.

As a companion with a very similar childhood relationship with the church and faith, Eryn’s comment was profound.

“It’s spiritual with or without the religion.”

For Eryn’s birthday, she brought Maddie and I to her Uncle’s home right on the Osage River - the only major watercourse in Missouri with which I had minimal experience. Compared to our neighboring Big Muddy, it’s quite little and docile - especially so, last weekend. Her Aunt explained that the Lake of the Ozarks was at just the right level to send neutralizing backpressure from downstream, leaving the current at virtually nill.

As a result, it was *utterly* and *eerily* still, Saturday night, to a degree that mesmerizes and spiritualizes one in such a way that they feel just the slightest bit different when they leave. Eryn’s family is wonderfully Italian in their cooking - food is *never* memorable for me, but I ate *several* dishes that were undoubtedly the best of their kind I’ve ever had - and their conversation, which was rewarding in contrast to my time spent with *my* very German, mostly withdrawn family.

There was even a packed evening tritoon ride to see a private party’s fireworks display that involved a bit of bottom-scraping due to our missing the break in a submerged rock wall and some *very* entertaining cross-water banter.

The unbroken calm of both wind and water combined with the night sky’s total lack of obstructions made the night quite magical. My peace was also magnified exponentially by my lack of a phone for the duration of the trip. (I let it die and did not seek out a charger.) It’s always a bit difficult to return to my life and this world of bonkers, idiosyncratic sentiments, recreations, and inventions.

Yesterday, I stopped by QuickTrip and ordered a grilled cheese sandwich from their *mounted touchscreen, visible cook, but no cashier* outfit and [reacted a bit dramatically](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/882226862063321088) to the whole idea, though I actually first encountered it in January on our way to Baltimore for MAGFest. Publicly, for the sake of entertainment, of course, but I do not need to falsify the sentiment at all - it *actually* disturbs me to see it - especially when I begin to extrapolate on its facsimile of the future.

Lastly, I’d appreciate your critique of the below snippet on a “Field Session” I attended at True/False, all those months ago. It’s not completed, obviously, but I’ve been hesitant to dive back into it because the whole perspective seems off, somehow. I excused it in the moment because I assumed I’d have more formal reviews/stories to offer, but this is by far the closest to completion.

Ultimately, I just want to know if it’s worth/is appropriate for publication, and - as always - I’d love any other criticism/suggestions you may have.

You can contact me over [email/social](http://extratone.com/bilge) or leave a comment on [Dropbox Paper](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/The-Field-Session-AxKqUkNCKMtI0Jm20PHxa).

Shucks… if you’ve made it *this* far, even, you’re a true friend. Thank you for your time.
