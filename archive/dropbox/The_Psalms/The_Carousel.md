# The Carousel
It would not be in good taste or fairness to say the rest of it is all a comedown, but it is the truth. And it would seem - even at my age - that we - *I -* haven’t rid enough foolishness to stop myself from chasing the stimulus when it’s always just out of reach. This is the conundrum I’ve diligently weaved myself into over the years: a single, shared source of it, sweeping over me - Debris (mostly dust and sparse gravel) - cyclically, standing in a seance circle, level with her other satellites, attitudinally, but currently the most ruined by a wide berth. (According to all available observations, anyway.)

Coming to her the first time emptyhanded should have manifested some comprehension of this arguing for myself that I need to lust after anything.

## There is beauty in denial.

Is infatuation even remotely replaceably enlivening? The wondering alone - wondering all the time, attuned keenly to all energies of a human being. Such overdue wondering put the breath in my body that was so fatally lacking; the wants like a sudden thousand curious children loudly boarding a ghost ship, hostilely - against the whole phenomena of stillness, itself.
