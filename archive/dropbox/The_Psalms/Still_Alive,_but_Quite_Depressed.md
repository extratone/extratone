# Still Alive, but Quite Depressed

## I crashed my car, but at least I have a cool camera and a wonderful companion.

Yupt, I crashed Nevermore - my XJR. I have long vowed to end my own life should such a situation occur, but I will be around for awhile, I promise.

It was in Tillmook, Oregon - a quaint little coastal town with a very friendly police force. Officer David Bartlett (undoubtedly an upcoming character in any of my upcoming fiction) allotted for my utter & immediate destitution upon the realization that my inadvertent running of a stopsign into a one-ton work truck had quite possibly totaled my favorite and most loyal object in the world. Unfortunately, I did not opt for collision insurance when signing up for Progressive, and my dearest Nevermoreâ€™s bent framerail is more or less guaranteed to render repairs over $12,000.
