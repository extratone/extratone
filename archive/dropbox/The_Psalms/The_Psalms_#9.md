# The Psalms #9
In June, I sorta just sprung a [single letter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/davidblue/issues/a-new-service-column-progress-and-a-broken-laptop-120300) on you and mentioned that it would be the chosen means of publishing these, claiming – [incorrectly](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/5/16855304/mailchimp-tinyletter-integration-platform-changes), it would seem – to have been more or less forced to seek out the badly-designed and certainly less-discreet Revue, due to resounding rumors of [TinyLetter’s imminent death](https://www.inc.com/maria-aspan/tinyletter-going-away.html). To be frank, I’m a bit confused by the affection for the rudimentary old service – all the cool personal tech and culture writer lists I once sought out and enjoyed have almost all fallen silent since 2016. I know the specifics of these companies, their products, and the interrelationships between them all don’t exactly make for thrilling reads, even for the most tech-embedded among us. Nevertheless, they *have* occupied a great portion of my learning, focus, and attention, and so this evening’s Psalm is inevitably populated with my experiences exploring the “[future of WordPress](http://bilge.world/panic-urine/),” my surprise-filled reacquaintance with Linux (both its literal and abstract existence,) Open Source computing in general, my [month spent without reliable internet](http://bilge.world/linux-bitch/), and [federated social networking](http://bilge.world/federated). In case you haven’t noticed, I’ve really come to enjoy the freedom “[blogging](http://bilge.world)” offers. It’s not the lack of *any* oversight whatsoever, nor necessarily even whatever exemption from quality, timelessness, history, etc one may or may not assume of those who’ve long assumed and even championed the label – it’s just that I was clearly [doing it anyway](http://extratone.com/red) on *Extratone*, punishing myself all the while for letting my self-centeredness get in the way of becoming the platform for the voices I had felt so privileged to have been exposed to, and eventually quite *obligated* to figure out a way to amplify theirs before continuing to invest any more in my own.

The most significant realization I’ve had for years now is that **what I was doing and how I was living in the pursuit of the ideals I wanted** ***Extratone*** **to embody and further was simply** ***not working***, and that it was time to stop and try something else. If it looks like I've just abandoned it in the time since, I certainly haven't - this is something I think about every day - but it's clear that I need to work on myself first instead of counting on a gosh darned WordPress website to save my life.
