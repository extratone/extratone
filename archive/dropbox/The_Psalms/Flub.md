# AMPHETAMINE COUNT: 0
## Thanks to some possible drama, and less-than-ideal circumstances, I’m going to be *beached* even earlier this month. Here are my last throes before I succumb to *rest*.

Though I was planning on finishing my [Ed’s Letter](http://extratone.com/freq) early again, this month, it looks like it’s going to be late - I’ve just taken my last pill - so I thought I’d try to get out as much as I can here, instead. Assuming everything goes according to plan, I’ll refill next in two weeks, three days.

First, I should apologize for the sudden spike in gas prices - I mismanaged a few assets in the UAE, and am going to have to spend the next few days and sleepless nights with my CFO making up ground before I can give you any numbers at all.

If you hadn’t noticed, my white Kaweco Classic Sport has [arrived](http://www.instagram.com/p/BWYII9HFYlf/) (the aforementioned Letter will likely share the featured image from this one,) and cleansed all color away - just for now. Though I am filthy and rank in body, my words are clean. They may be chaotic, though - I plan to toss in bits of the unrelated stuff I’ve been penning, as of late.


    *made my home a little late,* 
    *wrapped my name around my waist;*
    *an old, rusted buckle,*
    *an old, rusting fate*

Thinking back, it seems like all I’ve done this month is fucking *aggregate*, so my upcoming longer-than-usual break may be necessary, anyway. For better or worse, I have even more self-aggregation in store for you.

Today - more or less out of the blue - a reader sent me his ‘[remix](https://clyp.it/ej4l0yeo)’ of a [ridiculous short video](https://youtu.be/SMKkzu89qZk) I did ages ago, and it is inexplicably hilarious. (Thanks galumu! Are you okay???????)

I seemed to get somewhere with [one of my digital Periscope improvs](https://www.pscp.tv/AsphaltApostle/1vAGRbODRNNGl) - or at least, I’m assuming it was better than usual, considering that it now has over 800 views.

Of course, the new Editor’s Companion to [*The Tone*](http://bit.ly/thetone) - called [*The Junction*](http://extratone.com/junction) - has been a surprisingly significant timesuck for me. (Surprising only in that I found myself compelled to do it.) I’ve been allowed such pursuits thanks to the recent work by [Isiah](http://extratone.com/heck) and [Tim](http://extratone.com/cactus), and - of course - by [*The Movie Closet*](http://extratone.com/moviecloset)’s crew, who just [celebrated](http://bit.ly/tmcyear) their first birthday.

The most reasonable reaction to this flyer is “NO,” of course, but truthfully, I hope we get the chance to go. I’ve been remarking on my need to attend an antique tractor pull again for years, now.

I think we’ve finally [found](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/884928024449363968) Hawthorn’s One True Calling.

If there’s one subject I could ramble on about for a *fucking blog*, it’s Keith Jarrett - he who has unquestionably removed more barriers between his humanity and his instrument as anyone alive - perhaps more than any who has ever lived. (He’s a Taurus. Hm.) If I have any one overarching goal in my own relationship with the piano, it’s to be as close of a facsimile of his - theirs - as I can possibly manifest.

[This particular record](https://youtu.be/rPngbtquXgw) will likely succumb to an ECM IP flagging and be defeated any day now, but I’ll keep backups around to swap, just in case. I know I’ve listened all the way through every Jarrett improv record at least once… but I do not remember resonating with *Sun Bear* to this degree throughout its entirety. Okay now… this is definitely pretentious, but what if that’s because I’ve finally put most of my [*Vienna*](https://youtu.be/jS7Yhdy5dqM) **and [*Köln*](https://youtu.be/WSP9Na2ozWM) **era behind me? That one of always-sleepy places in big, sad sky?

What if I am now closing in on my *Sun Bear* - vastly more in-tune with the rhythms of the things around me? Note the waterfall simulation in the last few minutes.

At midnight tomorrow, Eryn and I will be boarding a Greyhound bus to Chicago for Pitchfork. I can’t promise too much, without *p i l l s* - and I’m specifically going as an *attendee* for a reason - but I’ll do my casual best to capture anything extraordinary we may encounter.

I suppose I’ll have to wait till next time to talk about [James Taylor](https://youtu.be/t9JxiHWOecw).
