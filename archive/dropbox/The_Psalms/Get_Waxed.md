## I heard a 15-year-old say it to his friend after he was berated for dropping a bag of chips, and it’s now my new favorite phrase.
# AMPHETAMINE COUNT: 0

The other night, I was a bit upset over some Very Old News, so Eryn took me driving (God bless,) and I said something really insightful, under the influence.

*What ends up important to you is a combination of what was important to your parents, what you never had, and what you couldn't have imagined.*

Of course, I didn’t intend for these to become yet *another* form of Extratone aggregation, but it would appear that a *personal* newsletter for me, at this point, isn’t altogether too different from those you receive from your [*Editor-in-Chief*](http://extratone.com/freq), and it looks like I should get as much word to you, ASAP, as I’ve run out of pills until the 28th.

*Is it possible to ironically hyperlink?* 

You need to have a look at [Isiah’s account of his Soylent experience](http://bit.ly/isiahsoylent) - it’s genuinely entertaining and educational.  Also, I made my [best attempt](http://bit.ly/tractorblogging), yesterday, at those end-of-week *Best of the News* lists that EiCs occasionally maintain.

Somehow, I managed to lose my glasses when Eryn and I went out, Friday night. I can’t remember the last time I’ve been without corrective lenses in These Fucked Streets. I’ve had to enlarge the text on my phone and laptop to Huge, Elderly mode, which is very embarrassing. I am now carless, blind, and - for some reason - grieving again over [the big happening,] but at least the website is doing well!!!

The military modified *Doom* to perform as a tactical simulator for training purposes in [1997](https://www.wired.com/1997/04/ff-doom/).

…I’m going to end that, there. 

Specifically aggregating the news and bits that terrify me now seems like a bad idea.
