# Hello again, friends.

In June, I sorta sprung a [single letter](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/davidblue/issues/a-new-service-column-progress-and-a-broken-laptop-120300) on you and mentioned that it would be the chosen means of publishing these, claiming – [incorrectly](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/5/16855304/mailchimp-tinyletter-integration-platform-changes), it would seem – to have been more or less forced to seek out the badly-designed and certainly less-discreet Revue, due to resounding rumors of [TinyLetter’s imminent death](https://www.inc.com/maria-aspan/tinyletter-going-away.html). To be frank, I’m a bit confused by the affection for the rudimentary old service – all the cool personal tech and culture writer lists I once sought out and enjoyed have almost all fallen silent since 2016. I know the specifics of these companies, their products, and the interrelationships between them all don’t exactly make for thrilling reads, even for the most tech-embedded among us. Nevertheless, they *have* occupied a great portion of my learning, focus, and attention, and so this evening’s Psalm is inevitably populated with commentary on my experiences exploring the “[future of WordPress](http://bilge.world/panic-urine/),” my surprise-filled reacquaintance with Linux (both its literal and abstract existence,) Open Source computing in general, my [month spent without reliable internet](http://bilge.world/linux-bitch/), and [federated social networking](http://bilge.world/federated). In case you hadn’t noticed, I’ve really come to enjoy the freedom “[blogging](http://bilge.world)” offers
