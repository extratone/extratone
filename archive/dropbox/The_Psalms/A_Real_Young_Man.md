## Smoking and Ubering all over this goddamned town.

It looks like I found a friend in Josh - a young j-school student who’s just interviewed me regarding *Extratone* for a profile assignment, which he apparently intends to follow up on. One who understands and responds to my infinite media industry-related conjecture, which is cherishable in and of itself. I’m rather amused at the thought of journalism professors reading/hearing about my *ideological* and *naive* undertaking.

It’s doubtful much more will be done for the site, this month, but the rest I’ve gotten spending time with Eryn will prove beneficiary, I think. I did write [*Lacky Sleaze*](http://bit.ly/smutsleaze) in general frustration with Columbia and the people my age (men, mostly) who seem to *literally* & *obviously* want nothing but to fuck. We’ve also been going pretty hard on [Anchor](http://extratone.com/anchor) - today is the first *Footwork Friday.*

I’d been meaning to show Eryn what I’ve [added](https://www.periscope.tv/AsphaltApostle/1OdKrygYYvVxX?t=50m41s) to [her song](https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut/sultry) on a more substantial instrument than my upright or keyboard for a while, and we finally managed to sneak into the music school to find a practice room with two identical Yamaha uprights. It’s important for me to play when sleep deprived (hence that one time I actually [*fell asleep*](https://soundcloud.com/digivoid/asleep) **on tape and continued to play.) As I understand it, the brain is less and less able to determine what is and is not relevant information. If I add adderall to the mix, I get much more eloquent (often pretentious) in everything I do - improvising, driving, writing, talking, etc.

Keeping in mind the context of an improvised session - it allows me to *find* more when I’m *searching*, if that makes any sense. My interactions involve both conscious and unconscious decisions, but they’re better when the latter is as great ‘a’ portion as possible.

The prime room with the full Yamaha grand was taken by a student practicing Bach, which is quite stressful to overhear, as you might imagine. I thought we were settling when we backtracked to the double-upright room, but the instruments themselves proved to be sublimely dynamic considering their orientational affliction. 

My ‘performance’ itself was adequate - I think I accomplished what I went to do - but the highlight of the experience began when Eryn started playing around. She just started rhythmically pressing different keys in exactly the same way I first did as a toddler. For whatever reason, I’ve never actually had the opportunity to improvise/add around somebody playing this way, and it was *unimaginably delightful*. A Real Hoot.

I’m often asked by siblings to ‘teach’ my nieces and nephews how to play, and the method I briefly tried with Eryn is the only one I’d apply (which is why I’ve refused.) All I did, really, was guide her own exploration. 

The most important debacle regarding piano ‘lessons’ is whether or not the potential student *actually wants* to learn, and it’s answer is found in how he/she/they behave when they’re sat in front of an instrument. If their fingers are not drawn to the keys - even after a wait, and/or some time left alone with it, perhaps - there’s not much to be done. If you *actually* want somebody to “play like me,” that is.

I’ll spare you my entire spiel romanticizing improvisation and instead refer you to [*Listen*](http://bit.ly/referencetradition), which I wrote almost a year ago about a local who I’d find, often playing Columbia’s downtown public piano. It’s an image of a musician in the aftermath of a rigorous academic musical curriculum: exceptionally talented at reproducing the works of others, but unable to listen to the music inside himself. 

Of course, your incentives depend on how you measure yourself. I know plenty of trained musicians who are very proud of their technical mastery - it’s those few who observe my relationship with longing (like the subject of the poem,) that need(ed) to be told, perhaps.

Anyway. Playing with Eryn was a real joy - I’ve never been able to share my relationship with the piano that way, before.

In other petty news, Nevermore is officially Out Of Action after its starter solenoid stuck, causing it to run constantly no matter what I did - even without the key in the ignition - until it burned the motor out. As much as I love my car, the funds needed to get it back in Proper Working Order - now some $3000, at least - are not within a reasonable savings goal in the foreseeable future, especially considering my [plan](http://bit.ly/freq10) to depart for the Northwest next Spring. 

Or at least, that’s what I’d been thinking. Now, I’m wondering if it’d be good for me to try doing the work, myself. I definitely *do not* have that *thing* that makes mechanics/technicians exceptional at figuring out how to fix most anything. It’s one of those incommunicable-but-immediately-apparent aspects of life. On my farm, I did have experience rebuilding/restoring a 1948 Ford 8N - the subject of [*To My Little Tractor*](http://bit.ly/feeblespdf) - but uh… things have changed, for one. I don’t have much option, though - at least as far as the starter is concerned. The car is immobile, without it.

I’ll don a white t-shirt and my last pair of *Ricky* jeans and hope the endeavor will fit well with my recent *return-to-origin*-themed existence. I also took my first Uber, and was a bit [too fascinated](https://twitter.com/i/moments/873182360363204608), but trading Ye Olde Jaguar for ride-sharing services will surely help reduce my *Actual Age* (A.A.) statistic.

A few nights ago, two girls came in to the station rolling on molly, big time. Naturally, they were absolutely fascinated with me and stole my phone to take a [snap](https://youtu.be/pmrVPelvhRo).

I have continued my experimentation with Mary Jane, thanks to Eryn’s company, and was able to get a few fairly-humorous observations down while high. (No, it is not cannabis journalism, though [this story](https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/high-times-legalization-news.php) did remind me of its existence, notably.)

*I remember shapes of the things in the hallway? in between the garage and the house. I think I remember a specific smell and image of Grandpa's minivan. I see "99" indicated on the digital speedometer?*

*Now smells and heats from a boyscout summer trip - the shower and the phones? I obsessively swept the restroom area. (It was not a building - it was open to the air.)*

*The sound of the trees moving in the wind standing close to the house on the North side, for ~2/3rds of a second. (That's something BMIs may be sophisticated enough to archive for me before I die.)*

I wish it was easier to retain memories of the sensation, but - as I’m sure you know - those side-effects dealing with memory, itself, are incredibly difficult to capture. It’d also be nice to retain… anything, really. I *do not* like losing time. 

Speaking of which: I have just found what is now my [favorite listicle of all time](http://antiquetractorblog.com/2015/05/25/why-i-love-the-8n-ford/) searching for images of the 8N to include. Is this [young woman](https://twitter.com/RachelGingell) who blogs about tractors the Long Lost Love I have been searching for?

The career, of course, not the individual. If *Extratone* fail to mature parallel to myself, and I reach a position allowing me to violate my death pact with the website, at least I have tractor blogging to fall back on. 

*Don’t let me forget the relic of the John Deere 45* *combine outside of Eryn’s hometown.*
