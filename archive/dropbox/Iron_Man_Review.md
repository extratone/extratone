# Iron Man Review
Bobby Downer is a younger one. J.A.R.V.I.S. wakes journo girl up in the morning with all the same bullshit as Bixby will now, but it’s not annoying because it’s 2008. I’m 14 and I imagine how cool it would be to be Tony Stork with his cars and immortal companions, but Malibu is bleak as hell and the Patriot Act is still Bad News. It’s a shame Marvel had to grow up again because it was doomed to fail in an ugly way.
