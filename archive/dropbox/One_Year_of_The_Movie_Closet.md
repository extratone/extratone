# One Year of The Movie Closet

## Celebrating the first birthday of the world’s premier cinema podcast.

[One year ago today](https://youtu.be/00Rf7hqLOQg), [Matt](https://www.instagram.com/jonathan_matthew_hall/), [Sam](https://www.instagram.com/unclespami/), and [Mikel](https://twitter.com/MikelBurtonBass) first joined [Ben Stokes](https://twitter.com/BennyBeats111) in his now-weathered film meta sanctum to pitch, vote on, watch, and discuss Science Fiction movies.

Ben approached me last Fall and we worked together to bring [Episode 14](http://bit.ly/moviecloset14) to *Extratone*. Since, the work ethic of the crew has kept us going in the dryest weeks, and sparkled the brightest with the best audio content available from us.

I’d like to recognize and express my infinite appreciation for their work, which has grown and matured impressively over the weeks and months in sound, brevity, and insight, but has managed to retain its charm with remarkable consistency.

I’ve said it many times before - it’s my favorite film podcast, and I - with the rest of our staff - look forward to another year and beyond!
