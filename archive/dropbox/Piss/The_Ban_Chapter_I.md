# The Ban | Chapter I
Humanity has existed in its current form (the species *Homo sapien*) for approximately two hundred thousand trips around our star. Our star – Sol, which we have described in exhaustive repetition throughout these trips as a *ball of flame*, a *great ball of fire*, or – most simply – *hot ball*. None of these descriptors are inaccurate – it is, of course, a gargantuan sphere of plasma – a sort of *ultra*fire – Huge, Hot, and utterly perfect. But you – the twenty-something white American male – arrived at this volume with a vague understanding of this – the source of all life, one hopes, along with at least a minimum of rudimentary familiarity with the classic legend of our genus’ *Discovery of Fire* and its supposed wakes in our proverbial evolutionary bathtub.
      *That singular man-ish thing surely experienced excusable terror (*Homo erectus*, probably), squatting with their friction stone, horrid face agape some million and a half years ago, witnessing the first of their kind’s entrapment of the Supreme Heavenly Ball’s likeness – the original conjuring of the chemical combustion we call *Fire*. Yes – their (likely foul) ancient, involuntary utterances at first sight of their Grounded God would be excused by any *reasonable* witness, then and now, but if a sober, contemporary working young man were to react in the same way, he should be derided as a coward.
      At least two young men recently reacted to my own minimally-combustive behavior as of late. It took place in a faux speakeasy in my adopted hometown of which I was a very early patron.
