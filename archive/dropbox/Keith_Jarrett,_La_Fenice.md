“The one I decide should come out, I decide as a listener. What is happening to me while I listen to it? If it’s enough of what was going on - if there’s enough that it should come out, then I know that. There are tremendous amount of concerts that are good. Aside from [technical issues], there is this factor of how much of the event can a CD listener *grasp it* because it isn’t in the moment anymore, it’s on the CD.
