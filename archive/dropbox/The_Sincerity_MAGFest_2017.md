I hadn't heard of MAGFest until this year. I think it was November when Justin first suggested we attend. Some brief research suggested the event's moderate size - in hype and attendance - would make for an ideal first for us as a magazine. As winter came, more and more friends began adding "@MAGFest" to their Twitter names, which quickly supplemented the necessity of our attendance.

Beforehand, I read somebody describe MAGFest as "ComicCon, ten years ago." I don't think it's unreasonable to see implicit anti-capitalism, there, which makes sense given what coverage I remember. (I've never been.) As [Satchel](https://twitter.com/Satchuation) - a fest-hotel liason - explained on *Futureland*, the event is called a *Festival* for a reason.

"A 'convention' is a bit more suit & tie, a 'festival' is free-spirited."

Merriam-Webster defines the former as "an assembly of persons met for a common **purpose**." To get something done, then. And "fun" doesn't count. Throughout the festival, I didn't once see an advertisement from a major corporation, though I (regretfully) didn't make it to a single panel.

Unlike ComicCon, MAGFest doesn't really have a press policy. We payed for our passes like everybody else, and were subject to the same codes of conduct. If we did share the floor with press, they weren't obvious, which is refreshing. Unless you're trying to sell something, there's not much reason for anything but egalitarian access.

Conversely, most definitions of "festival" include celebration, which is vastly more apt of the MAG culture, and enlightening in regards to my own behavior and failures. I've never known how to celebrate or vacation. Covering others' is my closest equivalent, I guess.

## But did we pass the test? Did we deliver?

In reflection, I've been concerned. As kind as our readers are, *nobody* wants to fund one man's drunken personal discoveries. Unless, perhaps, they were to include some worthwhile perspective.

If anything, we spent most of our time probing the whole body for weak spots and found... virtually none. I doubt there were more than a handful of other attendees who did not touch a single console or arcade machine throughout the course of the weekend. I hope not, anyway.

In that way, I was the most on the lookout for dissenters, depravity, chaos, and disaster, but came up completely emptyhanded. You'd think the only guarantee of such serenity in a gathering of this size would be a total lack of diversity, but... again, MAGFest would have you, there. Sorta.

$80 a pass and 5-star prices for Gaylord stay meant that everyone actually wanted to be there. This - and some interest in gaming and/or music, obviously - were the only universal sentiments. Of course, they include plenty of reliable stigmas - I didn't see anybody over 60, at least. There were stories of somebody in a "MAGA" hat floating around, but I doubt the individual would've lasted very long were he to open his mouth, so the demography wasn't representative of the general population, perhaps. Would that have been desirable?

Considering the "celebration" factor, a *Christmas on the Front* sort of truce could be the culprit. If any neo-nazis, violent anarchists, or Jehovah's Witnesses were in attendance, it was to play video games. As I proved in my attempts to be edgy, all non-festival related actions, questions, or activities were quickly forgone or ignored for relevancy's sake. I've never seen such universally impenetrable reason in the face of provocation. *Nobody* got mad. The closest semblance to aggression I experienced was a firm pre-talk warning from "Freedom" in the soapbox, but I was obviously and explicitly out-of-bounds at the time, and he was undoubtedly in the minority as... someone who would take pride in calling themselves "Freedom."

## "Gaming brings people together" is a cliché but well-proven expression. 

Somewhat famously, MAGFest provides a gigantic exhibit hall dedicated to arcade machines, all reprogrammed for unlimited coinless play. It's kept dark, except for stage lights and intermittent strobes decorating the haze. (I'm assuming there were smoke machines, but I forgot to look for them.) At all hours, it was packed and deafening with sounds old and new. It's the visual and auditory equivalent of a flower shop's olfactory enchantment. In my laps, I saw queuing and collaboration of an inhuman caliber; everybody played and watched, freely. For arcade enthusiasts, I doubt such a utopia exists elsewhere.

## The Sex

If you're at all familiar with the furry fandom, it's probably through Twitter and/or [Vine](https://vine.co/v/MjlE0Qb3P5b) culture, and it'd be unusual (in my experience) if you held its friary in high regard. I was no exception to the common assumptions about the suited bunch, though I hadn't given them much genuine or prolonged attention. (I assumed I probably didn't want to know any more than I already did.)

Though I'd been proxy to milder, highly self-deprecating aspects of the society through a longtime friend on Twitter, I had never actually shared physical space with someone in a fursuit until MAGFest. 

The few of whom I interacted with were nothing but civil, friendly, and good-humored, and their costumes were *not* the sun-faded, ill-fitting Sorrow Suits I'd seen from Shame Twitter. In fact, there were some that were downrite masterful. I didn't see a single one that did not bring their Flex, and that is deeply respectable.

It's funny - I often hear an awfully archaic sentiment regarding furry fetishism itself: *I don't care what they do, I just don't want to see it*, yet the only unwanted sexual attention throughout our entire experience came from a thirty-something mathematics professor in a cheap safari outfit who attempted to conceal his advances toward Emily by blanketing the whole lot of us with his stale breath, and it's not as if one need travel to Maryland to find a pudgy, balding, cishet-ass academic.

Whatever sex was had in that place was not had publicly; nothing more indecent than a few belly buttons were paraded on the floor. Perhaps I could've discovered more debauchery had I actively sought it out, but I am old, and innately respectful of privacy, which is dull.

## The Friends

*Friends*.

The word lacks the strength to carry the significance, really.

According to my profile, I created my Twitter account in June, 2009, at 15, and I've looked at the service at least once for 90% of the 2800 days, since. I'm not exaggerating when I say that the *only* other life element I've retained so completely is my piano habit. Consistency is absolutely alien to me, for better or worse. I'm telling you this for perspective's sake - I am *very* socially dependent on Twitter, and have been for my entire adult life. I've used it to osmose into infinitely many networks, in some way, as my interests, voice, and brain cells have changed. In high school, when diversity of thought and experiences are the most essential in forming one's identity, I found a relative lack of both in College Town, Midwest. In the immediate, at least.

[James Wilson’s [first appearance](http://www.extratone.com/audio/drycast/baconkale/) on *Drycast.*]

Through a *very* tiny group of school friends, I became acquainted with a first few persons, an unfortunate number of whom I cannot recall. All were identified by relatively anonymous display names, except for myself. Most were unified by their interest in anime, but I'd never seen a bit of it. Many have long since disappeared from my spheres, but won't necessarily be forgotten, thanks to my infinite archive of now-dead end replies. Despite dwelling as the black sheep of the community, some have managed to tolerate me for the whole duration, like James and Eamon.

I don't know what it means, but I know it's significant. I wasn't surprised to learn that a great many of us were making similarly tardy contact. Some were nervous - and I expected to be - but I felt nothing but elation on our first thirty-minute commute on Friday afternoon. 100% *sober* elation, too, which has been all but non-existent in my emotional spectrum for years.

After we picked up our passes, [Isiah](https://twitter.com/ammnontet) was the first to find us. I'd depend on him for navigation - spatially and socially - for every bit of my MAGFest wandering, essentially. He managed to do so reliably while still making time to coalesce with everyone, displaying extraordinary patience and aptitude. We'd all do well to absorb some of his habits, I think.

First, I would meet the two Pals of the Cinema, James & Eamon, immediately setting the latter ablaze for a moment with the cigarette in my hand. This is a legacy I am more than comfortable with - he didn't perish, and we were able to eat food with [jab50yen](https://twitter.com/jab50yen) and the most irate, high-definition [gamer](https://twitter.com/IrateGamerHD) around. 
*If you came this far expecting food reporting, I'll do my best to be sorry to disappoint you.*

## 

Of course, most of the press [coverage](http://magfest.org/press/) of the festival to date has focused on its video games. Despite my own irreverence, I am obliged to acknowledge some distinct truths about its ecology.

**"Gaming brings people together" is a cliché but well-proven expression.** 

Somewhat famously, MAGFest provides a gigantic exhibit hall dedicated to arcade machines, all reprogrammed for unlimited coinless play. It's kept dark, except for stage lights and intermittent strobes decorating the haze. (I'm assuming there were smoke machines, but I forgot to look for them.) At all hours, it was packed and deafening with sounds old and new. It's the visual and auditory equivalent of a flower shop's olfactory enchantment. In my laps, I saw queuing and collaboration of an inhuman caliber; everybody played and watched, freely. For arcade enthusiasts, I doubt such a utopia exists elsewhere. 

Two halls over, all kinds of developers were taking to heels, showing off their Indie wares in a complementary, more conversational environment than the arcade alcove. There, we spoke to our friend [mushbruh](https://twitter.com/mushbuh) about his charming (and already well-liked) [*Burrito Galaxy*](http://www.burritogalaxy.com).

The exhibit hall showed off many indie games both in development and ready to be played on platforms such as steam. One of the most popular ones included Screenwave Media’s ‘Use Your Words’. A take on the Jackbox Party Pack series. ‘Use Your Words’ was started by Youtuber/Musician ‘BrentalFloss’ where you can use your smartphone to fill in the blanks of various places such as empty newspaper articles, vacation greeting cards, and movie subtitles.
