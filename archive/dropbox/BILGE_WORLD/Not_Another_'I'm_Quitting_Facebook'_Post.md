## **I could live without Facebook, but I guess I won’t (and nobody cares.)**

It seems like all of us (in this context meaning you, my Facebook friends) have been using Facebook for about the same amount of time - since 2008 or so - but the degree to which we’ve adopted it into our lives varies tremendously, and I’ve always found this fascinating. Those of my Facebook friends who actually use the service seem to use it *a lot*, and - despite the [continuing rise of mature users’ percentage](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Ftechnology%2F2018%2Ffeb%2F12%2Fis-facebook-for-old-people-over-55s-flock-in-as-the-young-leave%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR0WxOz5oLhiA7wuSxJJfnYCNtFSNUich0KP9vqlgpINhRee9rG2bs80ZPc&h=AT0sRSJbxfjQ1dJj_kC7OTl3P3GIB6-Mxz-kh7NQgxPLjBFlY2NA8Ev2NMePaabyamkbdj0kxTWqMPZ8sW-nYHCz0WLcdhHYKG5Tfb6K-2ZxNbotG51XicCDtsXg_OzRbI3N_WVSs63dFZDfYZs) - the vast majority are my peers. Like some of you, I’m sure, I’ve sporadically used Facebook in more or less concentrated bursts, usually in response to its respective relevance in the lives of those who happen to be around me at any given time, but I’ve consistently maintained for years that **this website is really bad** for both society as a whole and the general wellbeing of us individuals. I know this is *far* from a unique argument, that you’ve heard it many times before, and that you have no reason to believe I’m an authority on anything, but I would like to reiterate one specific thought from a [rant I wrote two years ago](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbilge.world%2Fmark-zuckerberg%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2Y9lJB2Oaaf9gks6gO5_SSrefnST3nU9yOcK1jt3ep3gRJ17fRWMNW9pE&h=AT0sRSJbxfjQ1dJj_kC7OTl3P3GIB6-Mxz-kh7NQgxPLjBFlY2NA8Ev2NMePaabyamkbdj0kxTWqMPZ8sW-nYHCz0WLcdhHYKG5Tfb6K-2ZxNbotG51XicCDtsXg_OzRbI3N_WVSs63dFZDfYZs):


> More than **one sixth** of all living eyes [see](https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.fb.com%2Fcompany-info%2F&h=AT0sRSJbxfjQ1dJj_kC7OTl3P3GIB6-Mxz-kh7NQgxPLjBFlY2NA8Ev2NMePaabyamkbdj0kxTWqMPZ8sW-nYHCz0WLcdhHYKG5Tfb6K-2ZxNbotG51XicCDtsXg_OzRbI3N_WVSs63dFZDfYZs) Fuckbook every single day [[as of 2015](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/nov/04/facebook-one-billion-users?fbclid=IwAR1h303KxfLaHddl67Vyc1yDVXV8RtCJDC8DOnq7C5O53rfgaDcDKRxIOTI),] placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most universally human activity.

For something like an entire year, I inserted this statistic in angst into far too many personal, family, and professional conversations, which I realize in retrospect was just an attempt to spread my alarm. That’s pretty lame, so I do apologize if you were a victim. It’s one of those inconceivable abstractions which I seem to get hung up on, but it’s also *actually* profound in the context of our species’ history. *Nothing* before had ever affected 1/6th of the world population in a single given day - not The Black Death, nor the World Wars (and it’s worth keeping in mind that it’s *more than doubled* since the last one of those) - until Facebook and now, COVID-19. That said, I would argue in my defense that **one can never overanalyze nor overcriticize what’s by far the most influential product in the history of the world**.

Relative to the much more established voices in tech journalism who've labored to cover the company over the years, my commentary is more or less irrelevant. Perhaps the most diligent of these is [Casey Newton](https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton), who writes [an incredible daily-ish newsletter about Social Media](https://www.theverge.com/pages/theinterface) and recently spoke to the *Columbia Journalism Review* for an [excellent report](https://www.cjr.org/special_report/reporting-on-facebook.php) on the history of tech media's Facebook coverage which includes a whole host of pertinent hyperlinks for your reference. There's also a [stuffed Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_Facebook) specifically dedicated to criticism of Facebook. On the occasions I have tried to write about Facebook myself, I've always become quickly overwhelmed by the jist of everything surrounding the company and its service: **Facebook is fucking crazy**. Everything I read in research culminates in this exclamation, compounding in an urge to simply scream it over and over again in the face of each spectacle. From its now fairly popularized [origin story](https://www.gq.com/story/boy-genius-of-the-year-mark-zuckerberg-facebook) to its "[world plan](https://time.com/facebook-world-plan/)" (including 737-sized solar powered internet drones,) to [Cambridge Analytica](https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files) and Zuckerberg's subsequent [congressional inquisition](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/live/2018/apr/10/mark-zuckerberg-testimony-live-congress-facebook-cambridge-analytica) (which I personally watched live in its vast entirety,) I have witnessed with the world - mouth agape - as the entity has become perhaps the most intellectually influential one in all of human history.

## **Function**

Rightfully overshadowed by such economic and political stories have long been the more technical failings in the user experience designs of Facebook, Inc.'s various properties. Acquisitions Instagram and WhatsApp have become unique in their respective segments in nuanced ways, but the user interface of the "Big Blue App" (yes, the reference to IBM's tyrannical history is intentional) has functioned unlike any other piece of software from its conception. In this case, "different" has meant "heap of shit" from my perspective, and that of a few others. In my search of The Web for arguments confirming this opinion (ahem,) I found surprisingly little from the tech media establishment. The most comprehensive by far was from a Medium-based publication called *UX Collective* entitled "[What we never talk about: Facebook has a product problem](https://uxdesign.cc/did-we-forget-that-facebooks-product-sucks-471c0aca1fcd)." There's also "[Facebook Is Terrible Not Because It's Evil, But Because It's Terrible](https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2019/01/18/facebook-is-terrible-not-because-its-evil-but-because-its-terrible/#3688093b305a)" from *Forbes*, which cites accounts of the author's specific user experiences in its argument against Facebook's usability as a whole:


> Facebook should be held to account for its role in weakening democracy and threatening privacy, but these huge scale issues miss the smaller point that Facebook is just...terrible, all on its own when you strip all that other stuff away. The entire site needs a massive overhaul, but if it hasn’t happened by now, I’m not sure it ever will.

It's important to note that both pieces predates [this year's redesign](https://www.engadget.com/facebook-web-browser-redesign-interview-133006571.html), FB5, into which I opted as soon as it was offered to me (I cannot remember exactly when, but it's been several months at least.) See *Engadget* for specifics if you'd like, but any of you still using the desktop site were [jarred into the thing itself](https://www.engadget.com/new-facebook-desktop-redesign-official-160054794.html) this past May. As Nick Summers notes, the incentives motivating the move should have been pure, in theory:


> Facebook's redesign isn't some wild swing for hyper growth. Instead, it's meant for the people who still enjoy loading up the website every day or who don't have a mobile device capable of using the company's apps. It's recognition that the legacy portal -- the one that started Facebook's colossal empire -- deserves more than the bare minimum.

Admittedly, the update - the most comprehensive single overhaul Facebook.com has undergone yet - addressed my most aesthetically-oriented complaints with an entirely revamped design language for the first time in its history, but all of the fundamental issues with its *core functionality* remain.

**Navigation**
Over and over again throughout the entirety of my 12+ years on Facebook, I have found myself unable to just *get where I want to go* on both the desktop interface and iOS app. I can't think of anything I'd rather do less than present to you a step-by-step example in much detail, but let's just use the draft of this Note for specificity's sake. When I first began writing this, the "Notes" section did not appear on my profile menu as it does now (presumably because I recently published [another Note](https://www.facebook.com/notes/david-blue/where-else-to-find-me/4121248871248546) for the first time in years.) Entering "notes" into the search field on the Home page yielded a result called "Notes" with the original Facebook Notes icon that was, in fact, a user-created, "like"-able Page (which had ~800 Likes, if I recall, though I cannot find it now.) Now, the same query's top result is separated from the rest in a module clearly entitled "Facebook Shortcuts," presumably also because I've actually begun using Notes again. On the iOS app, the Notes section itself appears to be entirely inaccessible.

I consider myself quite adept at figuring out how to use software very quickly - not necessarily because I understand how it works on the backend any better than the average user, but because I've simply used *a lot*. My trouble navigating Facebook's interface - on both desktop and iOS - has remained entirely unique from that of any other service, social or otherwise, for its twelve-year duration. Without boring you to death with more links from design-centric Medium publications, I'd argue that this difficulty reflects violations of several (undefined, I promise) Core Design Principles for which I never would've expected to advocate. In general, I believe "[good web design](https://bilge.world/google-page-experience)" is a horrendous ideal against the potential creative diversity of The Web which the majority of designers should endeavor to cast off, going forward, but in the case of this - the most widely-used piece of software to ever exist - I have felt singularly compelled to cite basic UX discipline.

Navigating Facebook has always been a nightmare, largely because of what I'll call *elemental shift*. In general, top-level elements should always be found where the user last left them, but Facebook has long chosen to instead arrange menus by algorithm in anticipation (I assume) of what users want. The result is a platform that - for me, at least - has always felt unsteady, like a condemned building. Moving about In the past few years, I have discovered a sort of manual method of navigating Facebook, providing my own stability: URL pagination. Instead of searching through my Profile for the link to the Notes section, I simply type facebook.com/notes in my address bar. The same goes for /photos, /videos, /pages, etc.
