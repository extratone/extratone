# iOS 12 Review
## This changes neverything.

In 2016, *Pokemon Go*, overclocked Apple Watches, pissing wearables, and What You See is What You Get blogging services all claimed unprecedented casualties among consumers according to *Futureland*'s iOS 10 episode, which we did our absolute best to dramatize in order to survive what was expected to be the dullest event on record. We'd only that day been first made aware of Boomerang photos and the mysterious nature of "[Live Blogging](https://www.calmlywriter.com/online/extratone.com/liveblog)" as an occupation. Ear Pods were introduced and subsequently shit on, and the [comparatively archaic](http://www.extratone.com/words/inred/mono/) 3.5mm analog audio jack was confidently parted with, finally. At least I got over "forgetting" about Live Photos because it's rapidly becoming difficult to keep stuff *on* the phone now. *I* am coming sincerely close to believing none of this is real, anyway.




By now, it's a damned straight ballgame, isn't it? A single month has now passed since Apple pushed out its major mobile OS release of this year to more devices than any one person could speedcount in a lifetime. You and I know by now, of course, that this means the iOS development community has already been using on their personal devices for nearly half a year by the time your irises are landing here. Hopefully, all but two or three stranded explorers in the arctic have updated their iPhones and iPads by now, and why wouldn’t they? Our expectations from this ritual are completely alien compared to those we’d need to anticipate from the event 5 or 6 releases ago, when one’s phone had to be *sent away* – in a sense – to latch itself tight to the stability of a desktop-class product in order to undergo a lengthy, destined metamorphosis. Sometimes, backups via 30-pin to USB-2.0 cables took *hours*, after which the custodian may or may not find their companion's replication had completed successfully.

If it had, one had to be sure to close any applications apart from iTunes to provide a working environment of utter silence – restarting after finishing the download was my own preferred method – before entrusting the despicably unreliable software to whittle away in a sometimes frantically rebooting, feverish procedure with near life-threatening stigma: it wasn’t uncommon for an update to inexplicably fail, “bricking” the subject iPhone and requiring that one take two whole steps in the wrong direction and restore it from *the entire backup* they’d just created (hopefully) in order to… make another, precisely-identical attempt, for lack of variables or alternatives to the process. However, if the user planned sufficiently and made a point to begin the whole charade immediately upon arriving home for the evening, these potential frustrations could be compensated for, and odds would favor counting on their smartphone to emerge safe and sound from the procedure just before bed, when even those holding the second-newest product in the lineage would have just enough screen time to notice that text entry, web page loading, and window management had noticeably slowed before sighing and tossing their device toward the darkness.

These days, one would need to try very hard to be inconvenienced by iOS updates. My iPhone 8 Plus is two or three times more powerful than my laptop at the moment, and my new friends' WiFi connection is better than what the State government uses internally, back home. I haven't needed to physically back it up more than once or twice since I bought it - iCloud stores the lot for $4.99 a month anyway. I blinked once watching *Riki-Oh* with high school friends some time ago and all of the sudden, a 1.6GB download isn't *really* a big deal. Siddown and watch your Instagram stories for twenty minutes, and hey! *You're ready to update!* Somehow, I have abruptly found myself in a reality in which *I* am the obvious bottleneck and my 100 words per minute on a *smartphone keyboard*, even, is no longer fast enough: my fucking phone is now waiting on *me* when it updates. *The keyholder is the whole god damned holdup.*

So, what *possible* purpose could there be in pounding out this ***"Review"*** of a free software update that's never really been optional (waiting a month is no longer a rational minimization of risk - it's just dumb,) nor is it more difficult to attain than a shallow young weed in fresh mulch outside your door, and does *not* compete at all for users on its native platform?

iOS is technically *software*, yes, but I've just contracted a terrible itch for some superior, transcendent term.
