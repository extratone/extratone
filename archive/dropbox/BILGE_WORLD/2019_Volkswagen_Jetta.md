It wasn't until I [first slotted myself](http://bit.ly/jettascope) into the astoundingly-erect driving position of the new, Mk VII Volkswagen Jetta that I first recognized that I am not only at least one whole generation behind in my familiarity with automotive technology, but entirely *virgo intacta* when it comes to the analysis of *actually* mass-produced cars. As in, the few automotive product lines which any given Earthly carbuyer is now (or has ever been) most likely to choose. For instance, the only two compact sedans I reviewed for [*Honk*](http://extratone.com/honk) - the [Cruze](https://youtu.be/40x4TF-6ggc) and the [Dart](https://youtu.be/zs9ScPleCTw) (apologies for the link spam) - have sold a total of ~[1,750,000](http://www.goodcarbadcar.net/2011/01/chevrolet-cruze-sales-figures/) and ~[180,000](http://fcauthority.com/fiat-chrysler-automobiles/fiat-chrysler-automobiles-sales-numbers/dodge-sales-numbers/dodge-dart-sales-numbers/) respective units in the U.S. over their lifetimes. In comparison to [the 17.5](https://www.businessinsider.com/volkswagen-vw-jetta-2019-review-photos-2019-1) [*million*](https://www.businessinsider.com/volkswagen-vw-jetta-2019-review-photos-2019-1) [examples of Volkwagen's Jetta](https://www.businessinsider.com/volkswagen-vw-jetta-2019-review-photos-2019-1) which blot and crawl our planet as you read this, all of the two Americans' little hilarities, charms, and vexations shift suddenly in one's perspective to become even more juvenile and tangential than they felt before. 

Culturally, the Jetta is an [infamous Titan of the mundane](https://youtu.be/2KZb545b4MU) and the butt of a host of [lethargic jokes](https://carstereotypes.com/car-stereotypes/volkswagen-jetta-stereotypes/) from mouths which wouldn't otherwise bother forming any words even remotely about automobiles, just as [the Beetle once was](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/sep/13/volkswagen-to-stop-making-its-iconic-beetle-in-2019). Granted, its predecessor was (rather absurdly) interwoven with the juvenile, hypocritical tapestry of Boomer Youth, for whom it became an "[anti-car statement](https://youtu.be/Jd5Ein5jixA)." Incredibly, this miserable, nasty, archaic child of Adolf managed to continue infecting the Earth *into the 21st century* [until July 30th, 2003](https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/last-classic-vw-beetle-rolls-off-the-line) with over 21.5 *million* replicates. Undoubtedly, it has killed hundreds of thousands, but it also underpinned the iconic [Dune Buggy](https://www.topgear.com/car-news/modified/man-invented-dune-buggy), beget the oversized toy car trend for [Barbie's 50th birthday](https://web.archive.org/web/20120905143227/http://www2.canada.com/theprovince/news/money/story.html?id=1373899), and starred alongside Lindsay Lohan in the peculiar, uncomfortable 2005 film, [*Herbie: Fully Loaded*](https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/22/movies/lord-love-a-vw-bug-that-knows-its-mind.html), from which multitudes of then-young Americans will never fully recover. I could write a dissertation about the Beetle's cultural consequences (and I'm [not alone](http://bilge.world/media/thinkingsmall-armstrong.pdf),) but let me just point out the single defining constant across the 7+ decades of its name: **deceit**. It began as a [Nazi scam](https://youtu.be/GqqOcR9JGdY) and has just ended with the 2019 model year in the form of a wholly-modern, globalized, 21st-century, overpriced "[Final Edition](https://www.automobilemag.com/news/2019-volkswagen-beetle-final-edition-review-first-drive/)" scam. Since the introduction of its first iteration in 1999, the “New Beetle” has remained little more than a re-bodied Golf with significantly less interior space (and overall practicality,) a compromised driving experience, and substantially-inflated price tag. Under even the most lackadaisical scrutiny, the Beetle marque has not been the “[20th-century icon](https://www.autoblog.com/2014/11/14/vw-beetle-most-important-object-20th-century-xcar-video/)” its popularized image suggests, but instead perhaps the most costly plague in all of automotive history.

While I was waiting at the local Volkswagen dealership for my rubber floor mats to be located, I made an effort to conversate with its receptionist - a moderately tasteful woman in her late 50s/early 60s - asking which of the maker’s current lineup *she* would choose if it was her own money. Her desk was faced her toward the impressive breadth of a perpendicular [Atlas](https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/atlas/2018/2018-volkswagen-atlas-se-long-term-arrival-review/), so I half expected her to gesture toward the nearly-$50,000 (as specced) People Wagon goliath out of indifference or unconscious familiarity. Instead, she spun and craned with effort around the divider behind her to point toward the showroom's yellow Beetle convertible and said "I'd buy that one and just cruise around on a sunny day." Arguably, the resulting pity I felt for her ignorance was unjustified and undeserved - they who [refuse to engage with](https://www.facebook.com/AsphaltApostle/posts/10217699275651744) any of the freely-available automotive media and commentary should probably be left to their heedless misery - but my time with the Jetta has made me much too Reasonable and Nice to give in to such Darwinistic sentiments.

When it came time for my mother to finally replace her [wretched, wrecked Third-Generation Honda CR-V](http://bilge.world/honda-crv-third-generation-crossover-review/), I took it upon myself to re-up my industry knowledge as much as possible in order to provide the perfect handful of recommendations to better her day-to-day driving life. I had my heart set on a Volvo wagon - [the V60](https://www.roadandtrack.com/car-culture/a23080032/the-2019-volvo-v60-goes-against-the-grain/), specifically - but my mother (like many American car buyers) has a severe and rather obstructing stigma surrounding what she calls "[station wagons](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/6jvgpy/why_are_wagons_not_a_thing_in_america/)," which I found myself unable to circumvent in order to convey the magic in the elegant, modern estate cars which [people like me love to fetishize](https://jalopnik.com/why-are-car-enthusiasts-so-obsessed-with-wagons-1688416665). If you can stand Doug DeMuro whatsoever, his explanation to his reader as to *why* exactly car folk obsess over the wagon format is a poignant insight: "they offer SUV cargo volume, and SUV seating capacity, and sometimes even SUV capabilities, except they have a center of gravity that falls within a major league baseball strike zone." Considering my mother is nearing her 70th year on Earth, you might regard any sort of performance-centered insistence on my part to be absurd or selfishly-motivated (both fair,) yet she tends to compare any prospective new car with memories of her "[TR6 sports car](https://youtu.be/4FageCtKA0g)" and triple digits on the autobahn throughout the early 1970s.


> To sum things up: wagons are cool and rare, while SUVs are boring and ubiquitous. Wagons are fast and fun, while SUVs are large and tippy. And according to car enthusiasts, this makes wagons waaay better than stupid, boring SUVs and the stupid, boring people who drive them. 

The night she brought the Jetta home, I realized that - though I actually *invented* adaptive cruise control funny enough - I'd yet to actually use it.
