# Tweetbot’s Last Stand

[ ] Native Twitter
[ ] Tweetbot
[ ] Toot! 
[ ] Mast
[ ] Speechify for more natural TTS.
[ ] Spark — yet *another* futile attempt to better myself and finally abandon my horribly abusive marriage to Apple Mail.
[ ] Supports Pocket and alternative browsers directly
[ ] What appears to be far superior stability combined with Tweetbot’s conservative approach to notifications *actually*

On Windows XP ballot day, I spent *my* beatnik-ass time marveling at the abrupt availability of some genuinely innovative social apps on the Apple App Store for the first time since iOS 7(?) Of course, I am aware that reasonable people would regard a “sneak peek,” NDA-violating, perfectly Adobe Premiered app review to be pretty fucking lame, and I might just be an insane man with a WordPress site, but I still believe it’s important to talk about software *especially* because virtually everyone uses it (as opposed to quieting down just when these apps and the people who make them attain the most advantageous possible position to fuck the whole world.)

That said, I’m going to keep this as brief as I can: Tweetbot’s [latest iteration](https://9to5mac.com/2018/10/18/tweetbot-true-dark-mode-gifs/) may actually justify the [dedicated subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tweetbot/) I’ve just discovered! (Reddit’s the last place anyone wants to talk about apps, I guess.) I’ve complained at length about Twitter’s increasingly hostile (but [justified, sortof](https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17274828/twitter-earning-q1-2018-profit-user-growth)) treatment of its once [astonishingly diverse landscape of third-party clients and tools](https://mashable.com/2009/05/02/twitter-iphone-apps/#S_O.z..2mqqJ), yet I’d honestly grown significantly in accepting that the dynamic would never again see the power of the world’s most cash-stuffed companies delivered into the sweaty hands of small, kooky one and two-man teams, and it *never* would’ve occurred to me that Tweetbot was still around — much less getting ready to update its trusty old app with a release that would suddenly make it clearly more stable *and* better-looking than its last competitor: [the Native Fuck, itself](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/twitter/id3339032711?mt=8), which has also undergone [significant cosmetic surgery](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/twitter-redesigns-ios-app-for-one-handed-scrolling/276541/), recently. Namely, they moved the *one fucking button* that’s given the app a usability premium over its mobile web-based low-rent clone.

“The compose button has been moved to the bottom right-hand corner and “floats” as users scroll down their timeline. That means the button is always available to quickly send a tweet when the mood strikes.”

Yeah okay, *Matt*.

Twitter Support is no Cher, yeah, but it seems strange that less than a thousand of Twitter’s [more than 300 million monthly users](http://bilge.world/media/birdearn.pdf) would bother to engage with the announcement of a significant fundamental change to its infrastructure. Imagine if the federal government announced via White House press conference that every stoplight in the United States was going to have its yellow light removed to “streamline workflow” or something, yet only 1000 *total* Americans even bothered to tune in to the television coverage across all the news networks. It’d be strange, yeah? Well, y’all are using Twitter more than you’re driving, I’ll bet. So **get out and** [**vote on my Twitter poll**](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1062859883211620352)**, you anti-democracy slob!**

In my Twitter glory days - that is, when I used to spend the entirety of every one of my community college classes Tweeting from my phone - there was a healthy offering of third-party clients on both mobile and desktop that filled the english of the era’s software media with an absolutely barbaric brand-beaten pile of linguistic Twittrash. Twitpic, Tweetdeck, Twittercounter, Twitterfeed, Twhirl, Twitturly, Twtpoll, Retweetist, Tweepler, Hellotxt, Twitdom, Tweetscan, Tweetburner, Tweetvisor, Twittervision, Twibs, Twistori, and Twitbin are just a few I picked up from a [10-year-old](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) [*TechCrunch*](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) [report](https://techcrunch.com/2009/02/19/the-top-20-twitter-applications/) listing the top 21 Twitter applications by traffic.

***Twibs*****.** 

Now, I have to stop myself from digging too deep here and attempting something absurd like *The History of Twitter Clients*, but the fucking material is there! I could spend an entire afternoon going through YouTube searches and gadget blogs because it brings me back to that time when I lived every day assuming these things were going to continue to astonish for my entire adulthood. So many incredible ideas! *However,* I’m going to save them for later and focus on a single application of mine that has been a longtime favorite. As I said, it was in community college that I first ponied up money for Tweetbot 3 on my iPhone 4S simply because the hype over it among app and gadget nerds was *so bonkers* that it managed to spill over into my life, despite the fact that iOS7 and I were having serious issues in our marriage.

    **The cognoscenti have been on Twitter for years now. Stephen Fry, the web service's patron saint - in Britain at least, joined in 2008. However, it wasn't until early 2009, somewhere around the time that Fry tweeted while stuck in a lift, that the service went truly mainstream. Mentions of Twitter, usually involving celebrities, could be found in newspapers and on breakfast television.**
