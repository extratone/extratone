    - At its core, the new YouTube Music is like the old YouTube music: It combines an ad-free version of YouTube, the video service, with the functionality of Spotify, Apple Music and Google Play’s music-only service.
    - There are a few new features, most notably the promise to serve you music suggestions “based on what you’ve played before, where you are and what you’re doing.” A year ago, it would have been no big deal for YouTube to tell you it was watching your usage so it could offer smarter suggestions about what you want to hear. Now, in a post-Cambridge Analytica world, that kind of surveillance seems like a double-edged sword to me, optically speaking. But Cohen and YouTube execs don’t seem to think it’s a problem. (Cue slightly uncomfortable [Barry White](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypyiAT1RelU)discussion.)
    - As I noted last week, one of the big changes with the new version of YouTube Music is that it effectively comes with a price hike: YouTube used to bundle its music service along with YouTube Red, which gave you ad-free access to all of YouTube, along with original programing. [Now YouTube Red is gone, and its replacement has a confusing name and costs $2 more (for new subscribers)](https://www.recode.net/2018/5/16/17363334/youtube-music-launches-youtube-red-youtube-premium-extra-charge-cobra-kai).
    - To me, the most interesting part of the new YouTube Music service isn’t the service itself, it’s YouTube’s efforts to get you to subscribe. Part of that will come from a big marketing push, but another part will come from YouTube’s efforts to make using free YouTube less attractive — to “[frustrate and seduce](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-03-21/youtube-to-frustrate-some-users-with-ads-so-they-pay-for-music)” free users into becoming paid users, in Cohen’s words. So it will be interesting to see how hard YouTube really pushes the idea of making their core service less attractive. On the one hand, they wouldn’t mind if people signed up for subscriptions. On the other hand, they certainly don’t want to frustrate free users into using the service less and *not* paying for a subscription. It’s going to be fascinating to watch.
