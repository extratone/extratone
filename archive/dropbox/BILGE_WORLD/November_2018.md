# November 2018
I returned home to Columbia, Missouri from Portland for the foreseeable future as the month began and immediately had some fun resurrecting my mother’s “old” 27-inch ~2010 iMac with a standard Ubuntu 18.10 installation. As such, it’s turned into a strange experience for me, composing text on such a gargantuan screen. It could definitely just be my own failing, but I feel like I actually end up significantly more distracted even if I’ve simply made the document stretch across the entire screen. I do wonder if it won’t *actually* require so drastically different a workflow experience as my Compaq Portable - a machine that really can’t do much else *but* process text - in order for me come back to Earth in the coming year’s work.
