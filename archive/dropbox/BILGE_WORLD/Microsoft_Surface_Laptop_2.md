# Microsoft Surface Laptop 2



Title | Dates | Assigned to | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
 | November 10, 2018 - November 10, 2018 |  | 
Arrival<br> | November 13, 2018 - November 13, 2018 |  | I discover that UPS simply didn’t notify me about the delivery, and stream the unboxing and setup.<br>
The Shortcuts Background<br> | November 16, 2018 - November 16, 2018 |  | In frustration, I find out that I’ve been using Windows 10 for how many years(?) completely unaware of the Windowskey shortcuts. I make a custom desktop background with a list of them.<br>
Dropped Bad<br> | November 26, 2018 - November 26, 2018 |  | The Surface 2 fell from the couch on its face, but is apparently light enough to prevent breakage.<br>
First Bathroom Use<br> | November 26, 2018 - November 26, 2018 |  | Because my “dedicated” Bathroom Machine was being used elsewhere, I used the Surface Laptop 2 while on the toilet for the first time, which may or may not be an actual milestone.<br>

[ ] Opinions on the new MacBook Air from [Dieter Bohn](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/6/18064552/macbook-air-2018-review-retina-keyboard-apple-features-battery-price) and [*The Vergecast*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/8/18075992/vergecast-podcast-330-ipad-pro-macbook-air-review), of course
        - "The more important you are, the less actually important work you do, and the more likely you are to be an iPad user."
        - “I think it’s stop pretending that the future of computing looks like Apple’s restrictions.”

[ ] "There's not a whole huge gap between an iPad Pro and the new Surface Laptop running Windows 10 S."

[ ] "It looks like a MacBook Air."
[ ] "If you're using this thing for work every day..."
[ ] "Fabric waxed over the top."
[ ] "The thing college students buy for the first year... here's somethin really cool for a thousand bucks."
[ ] "Why did Microsoft finally make the laptop we've always wanted them to make now?"
[ ] "Putting Bing as a default [search engine] in itself is a signal to your customers that you don't actually care about them."

> A good computer should not be so user-friendly that it tricks you into believing that its world, full of passive consumption and active surveillance, is the same as the real one. Instead, it should be just annoying enough and full of weird novelties to remind you that a computer is just a tool that you use to do stuff.
> In MacWorld, syncing to the cloud is so effortless that I’ve never actually bothered figuring out how to enter the cloud and poke around the archive of my digital past. It’s there somewhere, probably, but finding it would take more effort than living with the latent dread of exposure and ridicule.

        - Snip & Sketch really *is* immediately inadequate... **Why can't I capture by window???**
## Surface Laptop 2 Reviews
[ ] The most universal lament is Microsoft's omission of a USB-C port, which I am more than happy with. In fact, the Laptop 2 includes no more or less than the ports I'd want/need.

> If the new [MacBook Air](https://zdcs.link/zjWl1?pageview=06Fe2GZo26XvMYZgLndTadT) came in at the same price as the old one, it would be a steal. Sure, you pay for the privilege of being able to use macOS on the Apple ecosystem. But in years past that also meant access to cutting-edge features and design. As pretty as the MacBook Air is, there's nothing that innovative about it. In today's Apple, it seems, privilege amounts to just staying current.

> In fact, the entire tablet was designed in-house by Microsoft's teams, and if you believe what was said in the presentation yesterday, design and functionality in hardware has suddenly become a big deal in Redmond. That's a big shift, and it's an important one. The announcement of the Surface shows that Microsoft is ready to make a break with its history — a history of hardware partnerships which relied on companies like Dell, HP, or Acer to actually bring its products to market. That may burn partners in the short term, but it could also give Microsoft something it desperately needs: a clear story.

[ ] Only a (albeit quite significant) component of what one could fairly characterize as *David Blue's Untimely Corporate Betrayal*
[ ] I've somehow managed to bunch up the alcantara on the left front corner already :( and somehow scuffed it just above the charging port
[ ] I'm not positive, but I believe my Laptop 2's cooling fan may already be experiencing some dust-bred blockage
[ ] Yes, appearance is very important when you spend the money for a machine like this
## CONFIRMED: I Have Entered *The Cloud*
[ ] Is the storage space enough?
[ ] Conservatively automatically lighted keyboard
[ ] WHERE IS THE TIME, WINDOWS 10
[ ] I adore [Windows Hello](https://youtu.be/LDJ8RtNEIPQ)
[ ] **USB PORT IN THE POWER ADAPTER** is the most thoughtful gift I've ever received in a while, personally.
[ ] 3:2 aspect ratio for reading and composition - **ACROSS THE** ***ENTIRE SURFACE RANGE*****!!??**
[ ] Once again, I can... *touch the web*, and once again... I'm not quite sure why. This is the only advantage I could see from the MacBook Air - Apple's negligence is actually well-placed in regards to omitting a touch screen.
[ ] I can't imagine ever desiring a laptop even 1/100th of a pound lighter, and I would love to speculate that these two products can be the last of the Great Consumer Tech Design Diet because it's left so many of us confused even still. It's just a shame I don't have a 5th arm/leg hybrid limb to serve as the Laptop 2's tray and allow me to continue typing at my full capacity whilst walking around upright.
## Stylistic Implications
[ ] Could it be "cool" or actually even just arrogantly pro-capitalist to sport a laptop actually ***made by*** the malicious M?
