----------

**Jim Fleming**: Chuck Klosterman is a novelist and cultural commentator. His collection, "Eating the Dinosaur," includes an essay about voyeurism called "Through a Glass, Blindly." It tells the story of the time Closterman spent living in Fargo North Dakota as he does Steve Paulson.

**Chuck Klosterman**: I used to live in this strange apartment. I guess the apartment wasn’t strange but it was constructed in a way that it was absolutely impossible to watch television without seeing directly in to the apartment across from me. And it was the same for this woman who lived in the other apartment. The way the windows were made and the way they put the cable hookup if you were watching TV unless you were drew your blinds, I guess I could have done that or she could have done that but you don’t’ want to live in, sit in the dark, you’re always seeing into this apartment. And there’s always been this belief that you know why do people like to you know like in "Rear Window," look into other people’s lives.

And everyone kind of takes for granted well it must be because we want to know other people’s secrets or you know we want to know how people live when the door is closed or whatever. And I think the reason it feels kind of exhilarating is because we don’t know what’s happening. The question in my mind most often when I would see in this woman’s apartment would be what is she doing now? Like it never made sense to me. And I always realized there was the possibility that I could see anything. That there was no restrictions on what might happen because I didn’t have a narrative of her life. It seemed as if I was always seeing something for the first time.

Now intellectually that makes someone very tense if you’re playing cards and playing blackjack and the whole game hinges on the next card that’s extremely stressful, but I think people who gamble would agree that’s an exhilarating feeling.

**Steve Paulson**: Sure there’s this intensity. You never know what’s going to happen. And to some degree I suppose also you’re making up stories that you think this might be part of, I mean what you’re watching.

**Klosterman**: The stereotype of someone who’s supposed to be a writer would be I look into this woman’s apartment and I would see these glimpses of her life and I would create these narratives in my mind about who she was and what she did, but I never felt like I got close to that. I mean I guess I could have don’t that if I’d seen her only once or twice but because I was seeing it all the time I would see this woman and she would see me all the time it was like just having a roommate who was incredibly quiet. Who you’d sort of see moving around doing these things I just felt like unknowing you know. And I mean that essay about voyeurism is this is maybe kind of reductionist and sort of childish but it’s sort of that desire to unknow things. And sometimes how great it would be to go back and watch certain movies not knowing what happens you know. Paulson: To be able to watch it for the first time again. Klosterman: And just the physical sensation of anti-intellectualism sort of, of not knowing. I spent my whole life trying to learn things, it’s a all I do it seems. I’m trying to always learn everything I can you know. And I suppose ostensibly to make my life better, but I wonder if you really lose a sense, a physical sense, of this experience of being alive or whatever by understanding what’s happening. I guess I like not knowing things.

**Fleming**: Chuck Klosterman is the author of "Eating the Dinosaur." He spoke with Steve Paulson.
