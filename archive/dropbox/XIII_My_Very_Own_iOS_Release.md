Every year since the first generation iPhone’s announcement in 2007, I have made it a tradition to watch the entirety of the World Wide Developer Conference’s opening keynote regardless of how disappointed I’ve expected to be since iOS 7 - the [post-Steve, post-skeuomorphic overhaul](https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/18/4741724/ios-7-review) used to justify the silent deletion of a few favorite features which I received as a cruel, deeply personal betrayal because my relationship with iPhone and iOS is both deeply personal and pretentiously complex. I have done my best to address this truth with brevity in preface to [everything I've written about iOS so far](https://extratone.com/tag:ios) in hopes that I can contribute substantially to related discourse from a unique perspective.

If you've arrived seeking a more contemporarily-arranged article about iOS 13, you might consider [my unedited notes for this piece](http://bit.ly/13beta) to be a sort of haphazard bibliography.

But part of what made Apple the Apple we know in the post-1997 era is that when Jobs was at the helm, all design decisions were going through someone with great taste. Not perfect taste, but great taste. But the other part of what made Jobs such a great leader is that he could recognize bad decisions, sooner rather than later, and get them fixed.
