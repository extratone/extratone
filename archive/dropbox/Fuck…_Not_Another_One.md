# Fuckâ€¦ Not Another One
Look... I haven't slept in a really long time and I'm thinking... about how awful TinyLetter looks... yet I know you can't have wanted to hear from me again so soon.

But my current mental capacity is insufficient for tackling anything on my excruciatingly long todo list, yet I always have the drive to get *some* sort of words into the world. And I know it's asking a lot to include images in emails in 2017...

For whatever reason, I thought it'd be hilarious to condemn Medium as "Bitch City" a few hours ago
