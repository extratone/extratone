AT&T UNIX System V Release 4 Version 2.1

I have converted the disk images from the original Teledisk (TD0) format to standard raw images.  Boot from base1.img and follow the on-screen instructions to install the base system.  Then boot into Unix, and install the additional packages using:

# pkgadd -d diskette1


Enjoy!
