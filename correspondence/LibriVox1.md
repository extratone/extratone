Librivox!

I just now discovered your existence! A Mastodon friend suggested that I read Machiavelli's *II Principe*, which I considered a bit out-of-scope for me to actually sit down and read, right now, but it occurred to me that it might make for a pleasant/positive background cadence in audiobook form. I can’t give you the details of the search engine results, unfortunately, but I know I was immediate activated upon seeing some snippet of meta… When I arrived upon [the LibriVox page for a reading of Marriot’s translation](https://librivox.org/the-prince-by-niccolo-machiavelli/) and realized the gist of the project, I actually yelled aloud… at Google, at myself, at all Gods, and at the abstract concept of algorithmic search recommendations, for by all reasonable accounts, **I should have heard about LibriVox years ago**. 

Ironically, as a contributor, I am less prepared to undertake spoken recordings in a hardware sense than I have been since prepubescence: I had to leave all of the audio equipment behind in a friend’s storage unit before moving across the country a few years ago. Naturally, they ended up forgetting to pay…

I know the prompt asked for detail, but let me spare you too much autobiographical verbosity:

1. I have undertaken small scale reading projects throughout my adult life and have enjoyed the unique challenges.
2. For the past year, I have been “working in public,” including an upcoming contribution on the actual viability of the iPhone 12 line as audio capture devices.
3. I have long believed in the Public Domain, but am now actually taking the time to understand public licensing, in general. When I agreed/agree to contractual-ish prompts before publishing my content, I actually, principally, provably agree and understand. (I would suggest that I am more trustworthy than ever in saying… I will not cause unnecessary legal trouble for the project. I would rather eat my own hair.)
4. I took the time to transition the digital edition of my 2015 poetry collection to the Public Domain in November of last year. I don’t think anybody is dying of joy about that, particularly, but it was well worth the understanding I (hopefully) gained about the specifics of Public Domain publishing.
5. My greatest cause regards the current percentage of American adults who are functionally illiterate in their day-to-day lives (I’m not going to tell you the number… it really is that disturbing.) I haven’t done enough in terms of literary education, but if I can’t help there, I thought perhaps I might lend my voice…


Thank you so much for your consideration, your time, and your work.
