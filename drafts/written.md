## General
* [x] **Telegram and Discord are the same age**
* [ ] [**Isiah’s random encounter**](https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/1449594872139186181)
* [ ] Telegram’s cross-platform, resource-frugal clients and phone number-based accounts/auth literally make it more **class mobile** than Discord.
* [ ] What in fuck is this website… “[Telegram for iOS - NONE](http://tsfkb.wikidot.com/apps:ios)”
* [ ] My [personal Telegram satellite GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/t)

* [x] Relative link to messages that don't involve complex scripting.
* [x] Unlimited file upload limit - **2GB PER FILE LIMIT**.
* [x] Cross-platform as all fuck.
* [ ] Every programming/scripting language ever has at least a few (probably unfinished and abandoned) projects in the wild building support for Telegram APIs.
* [x] Drafts as a safe dependable space to compose text does not have a windows equivalent, but Telegram can sort of function in that regard, largely because it continuously saves what one types in the text field. 
* [ ] Element … or Matrix… or whatever the actual protocol is called… is nothing but a great way to waste your time and the planet’s energy in obfuscating willy nilly. 
* [ ] Perhaps I should have accepted long ago that my particular priorities are *not* as resonant with other users as I would like to believe.
* [ ] Notification management in Telegram as well considered as I’ve ever experienced, which makes a lot of sense now that I am a long time user.
* [x] When I lost all my shit in Portland, much of what was saved was thanks to Telegram.
* [ ] The particular features that define Telegram’s competence are not immediately obvious, for the most part. Being able to quickly change the recipient of a forwarded message, for instance,
* [ ] Telegram is notably lacking in translation support considering it's such an international space.
* [ ] Microsoft Teams needs to be considered as an alternative since it's being so heavily emphasized for *personal use* in Windows 11.
* [x] The **cost** of Telegram vs. Discord Nitro, now.
* [ ] [[SI on Discord Regarding Objective-C and Swift]]
* [ ] "Last seen within a week will be kicked."

> A single boost costs $4.99 a month, and any member of the Discord Server can contribute. If you’re a Discord Nitro subscriber, you get a 30% discount on all Discord Server Boost purchases. Recently, Discord introduced lower thresholds for upgrading Discord Server Levels. Before, it takes 15 server boosts to achieve Level 2, and 30 server boosts to reach Level 3. But in a recent update, it will now only take 7 server boosts to reach Level 2, and 14 boosts to reach Level 3. That’d be a total of $34.93 for Level 2 and $69.86 for Level 3. That’s $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3 for Nitro subscribers.

# I Trust Telegram

![Patel Clouds Theme in the Chat Background Tool](https://i.snap.as/9Bxz27ZX.png)

## How I’ve used Telegram as the ultimate cross-platform Universal Clipboard, file sharing service, and more.

Believe it or not, I, too originally sought the Russian-owned, cross-platform-as-hell messaging service for “privacy” - or perhaps *solitude* would be more apt. It was in 2017, amidst the shock that the Tump Presidency was *actually going to happen* [^1], that I happened to hear about his pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, whom had just 18 months prior led myself and some twenty thousand other poor souls in a most capitalist prayer to the Christian God for prosperity at her pyramid scheme’s ultimate “superbowl” gathering in Cincinatti. I had decided to “infiltrate” AMWAY under the ridiculous assumption that I might be able to contribute some new insight in writing critically about what I might witness. (In truth, I found my experiences that summer so utterly traumatic, existentially, that I never was able to do so.) I don’t know what consequences of her ascension to the Lord of American Schooling I expected to happen, but I was pretty hysterical about it - that is, more unhumorously alarmed about some grander world happening as I’d ever been by a long shot. For the first and only time in memory, I felt compelled to take some sort of malicious, obscured action - to organize somehow for a purpose other than to be publicly critical of this person, and to use my knowledge about digital media to the fullest possible extent to scrutinize her administration’s every movement and to be prepared, even, to take some sort of real action if she… well, I don’t know. I *didn’t* know anything, really, about anti-government organization, generally, but I was not acting rationally in the slightest.[^2]

![White Sapphire](https://i.snap.as/aNADRjvK.png)

I’m bringing this up for a few reasons, and the fact that the very first digital decision of my personal hysteria was to set up a private Telegram channel is telling, though I can’t recall just how much or how little I actually knew about it at the time. I launched myself back to the channel’s very beginning (easier to do with regular URLs than in any other service I’ve ever encountered,) but was only able to bring myself to dig just long enough to grab the utterly absurd photograph above… Though I certainly did not consider myself actively *interested in automation* at the time,[^3] Telegram’s infamous bot ecosystem proved so prevalent (and accessible,) that I was able to configure at least three bots on that channel within days of first establishing it: a repeater hooked to DeVos’ Twitter account, an RSS-powered bot watching the main feed of a website set up by Senator Elizabeth Warren called [*DeVos Watch*](https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/devos-watch), and another republishing everything from [the Department of Education’s press releases feed](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases). 

https://twitter.com/ammnontet/status/1449594872139186181

Was any of it genuinely useful in helping me maintain *Action Readiness* in hypothetical defense of American education? Most certainly not. It was, however, genuinely *comforting* to have such diligent, automated minions keeping watch - to have a centralized, private, reliable, and purely-chronological feed of information in a super-handy location, regardless of whether or not it was usable. As I began to unconsciously integrate Telegram into my day-to-day online life on both of my PCs and my iPhone, the usefulness of my private channel for *other* applications became rapidly apparent. On iOS, not even dedicated file managers like DEVONthink are capable (or *willing* might be a more accurate term) of handling the diversity of data Telegram will happily pass on for you, *especially* through the Share Sheet.

## Drafting

I have used this “flow” so extensively for so long that it has come to define the whole of the abstract method in my muscle memory. Observe me browsing the web on my phone in an exhausted or particularly distractible state and you’d probably catch at least one or two completely irrational, inexplicable instances of sharing to my “[Saved Messages](https://telegram.org/blog/albums-saved-messages)” Telegram channel, which would be problematic for just about any other link-saving service. Add too many links to Safari’s Read Later list and you’ll end up crashing the browser on your Mac. I don’t even feel comfortable sending links willy nilly to the brilliant bookmark managing/curatorial service Raindrop, these days, after finding out that my [Reading List feed](https://raindrop.io/davidblue/reading-list-13380406) has *actual daily followers*, but there are zero consequences to sending ultimately-worthless or duplicate links to my personal Telegram channel, which has no content limit and is instantly and competently searchable.

![Send to Telegram Drafts Action](https://i.snap.as/p3K96LiX.png)

Over the years, I’ve discovered a bunch of other uses for the Saved Messages channel. As demonstrated in the screenshots embedded above, the [Send to Telegram Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E) for my writing app, Drafts, utilizes Telegram for iOS’ Universal Links support (in the format `tg://…`) to instantly send the whole text of the current document in Drafts to a Telegram channel of one’s choice. I suspect this was intended to streamline posting for admins of public channels, but I’ve used it to quickly “back up” work as well as to transfer edits directly to my (Windows-running) PC. By adding `&to=+[my phone number]` to the end of the action’s URL, I was able to remove the single, unnecessary step of choosing the destination chat. Because text messages are automatically split at 5000 characters, though, I usually depend on the [Share as Markdown File Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1V4) (the output of which I also send to Saved Messages through the Share Sheet) for the latter function. Anecdotally I’ve also used this method literally just to inspect unknown content passed to the Share Sheet because it’s often **faster than Quick Look** to share to my Saved Messages channel and then immediately open it in the app. (Hilarious, I suppose. Mostly sad, these days.)

I found my inspiration for this Post in replying to a [thread on the Automators.fm Discourse forum](https://talk.automators.fm/t/equivalent-to-drafts-but-for-windows/6159) regarding a Windows equivlalent to the same Mac/iOS/iPadOS app Drafts mentioned above. I suppose my reply was a bit off-topic, in retrospect, but still worth including:

> I have been using [**Telegram**](https://desktop.telegram.org/), of all things for years. Notably, if you hit Ctrl + 0 from *anywhere* in the Windows client, you and your cursor are taken to the compose field beneath your personal "Saved Messages" channel, which is searchable, has an extremely high per-message character limit (after which it just automatically splits,) and is ridiculously reliable in saving "drafts" live as you're typing. As in... I have actively tried to lose characters by killing the application and then logging in on my phone and have yet to accomplish losing a single one (among other advantages: zero formatting added to plain text by default - not even line breaks - no total file limit and *2GB* per file limit uploads, absurdly cross-platform, literally more reliable than SMS in poor network conditions.) You can immediately reenter a sent message with `↑` to edit, copy it, escape with just `Esc` and then paste to start a new revision. 

The feature within Telegram that makes this whole usecase worthwhile was introduced in [June, 2016](https://telegram.org/blog/drafts), and is entitled - appropriately - “Drafts.” Unlike the Drafts function in Twitter’s various native clients, for instance, Telegram’s really is impossible to fool, though it’s not perfect. [Markdown formatting support](https://telegra.ph/markdown-07-07) is inconsistent across Telegram clients - the iOS app being the most woeful - and the few keyboard shortcuts the app supports on iPad are not supported whatsoever on iPhone.

## Universal Clipboard

Users familiar with the MacOS + iOS + iPadOS ecosystem should be well-acquainted with “[Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209460),” which instantly synchronizes clipboard content across Apple devices. More recently, Android + Windows users have supposedly had access to an [equivalent functionality](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/seamlessly-transfer-content-between-your-devices-8a0ead3c-2f15-1338-66ca-70cf4ae81fcb#WindowsVersion=Windows_10). To my knowledge, though, truly cross-platform clipboard sync has yet to be realized.[^4] As someone who’s used iOS and Windows regularly - along with Linux, occasionally - for more than a decade, now, I’d put my full weight behind Telegram as the best available solution from (far too much) personal experience.

![Security Considerations in Telegram for iOS](https://i.snap.as/Qim9gsZZ.png)

When first entering a new system, real or virtual, regardless of OS, my very first step upon completion of its setup process has for years been to install Telegram, largely because all of my passwords for any/all given services are huge - 30+ characters, at least - and complex enough that typing them out is both tricky and absurdly time-consuming. Authorizing a new Telegram client, however, is as simple as entering a one-time numeric passcode or scanning a QR code. Managing logged-in sessions (see: the far right screenshot embedded above) is quick, reliable, and includes a handy button to kill all but the current session. Thanks to these considerations, I feel quite comfortable sending myself passwords in Telegram, including .csv exports of whole password vaults, when it’s appropriate, even when working on systems I do not own. For this function, I can’t think of any other service/software capable of replacing Telegram.

For day-to-day hyperlink sharing across my platforms, a variety of alternatives continue to come and go. The “Send to [device]” features represented throughout the palette of available web browsers - Firefox, Opera, Edge Chromium, Chrome, etc. - aren’t exactly reliable, in my experience. Most recently, I discovered a service specific to Hewlett Packard machines called “[QuickDrop](https://www.hp.com/us-en/solutions/quickdrop-photo-sharing-app.html),” which - along with [its accompanying iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hp-quickdrop/id1495071972) - does indeed allow me to send files, links, and text between my iPhone and Big Boy HP tower, though even my brief testing was filled with inexplicable prompts to reauthenticate and intermittent hangups, neither of which lend easily to regular use. I still maintain high hopes for [Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net/), which allows devices to share files and text over a *local* network from within any web browser, but it, too, is prone to frustrating hangups.

![Drake Telegram Joke](https://i.snap.as/2YhRCO0I.jpeg)

## File Transfer & Cloud Backup

Amidst the saga of my failed move to Portland spanning 2017-2019, I ended up losing *all* of my physical file storage - my old desktop and its hard drive, as well as 3 external drives containing a bunch of raw video I probably wouldn’t have gotten around to using, anyway, site backups for *Extratone*, and who knows what else. This loss taught me many grand, metaphysical life lessons (I hope,) but more practically, it affirmed a (admittedly gluttonous) truth about digital assets: if one truly wishes to make a file permanent, they must back it up in as many different places as possible.[^5] Perhaps the single most durable of these in my own computing life to date has been Telegram, which still has no per-account file upload limit and a per-file size limit of *two gigabytes*. The amount of pre-2019 work I’ve recovered solely thanks to Telegram is too great to enumerate here, but a rough draft of my [2018 Thankful for Bandcamp Mix](https://pod.link/1437549809/episode/626a66d3f37807b69c59f56faa4d3b94) comes immediately to mind.

How exactly the service is able to maintain this virtually unrestricted storage, infrastructurally, borders on *don’t want to know* status. My own net server impact as a user is fairly difficult to estimate, but I’d bet real paper currency it’s between 50 and 100 GB, the vast majority of which I uploaded several years ago. Within any mainstream cloud file storage service - Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, iCloud, etc. - the cost of storing that amount *over time* would have added up to a not-insignificant chunk of change. I don’t want to advocate for Telegram as a cloud storage replacement for loaded cheapskates, but for working-class users on a $0 budget, it can be counted upon to keep large files in a relatively shareable, ultra cross-platform, and super-accessible manner. Students, especially, should take note.

## Community

At this point in my life, I must acknowledge to both readers and myself that **I am completely inept at community organization**. Especially when it comes to grand suggestions about how I suppose online communities might be ideally-run or just better served by particular software environments and configurations, I have literally received *zero* positive feedback, and not because I haven’t spent significant time positing publicly within the space. I spent the first half of my twenties trying to Peter Pan an independent online music magazine into existence, written by fresh-minded youths on the fringe at 140% throttle and managed to accomplish startlingly little for my all my invested time and gumption. The relevant component of that tale was a significant and all-out commitment from the beginning to run the whole project entirely within Discord. 

The one absent activity throughout my years of Telegram use - save for intermittent correspondence during one relationship - has been *messaging other users*. I managed to find and participate in a few group chats - “[Telegram iOS Talk](https://t.me/TelegramiOStalk)” and [*It's FOSS*' official channel](https://t.me/itsfoss_official), notably - in my preparation/research for this post. I’ve discovered plenty of new clever bits, like the button to jump to one’s nearest mention in a chat. I’ve also done my best to actually apply some [much-needed administrative attention](https://t.me/columbiamo/7774) to [my years-old attempt](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/c4na0v/local_telegram_group_chat_for_columbia) at creating the [definitive location-based local group chat](https://telegram.org/blog/contacts-local-groups) for the Mid-Missouri area where I live. Truthfully… It [hasn’t exactly gone as I’d hoped](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/q0843f/local_telegram_group_chat), but the failures have been all my own. I have yet to find a satisfactory balance in terms of moderation bots, so I’ve (as of this writing) resorted to manually removing the (significant) spam bot traffic by hand. Also, I must admit that I’ve never had to do so more than once or twice on *Extratone*’s public Discord, despite how much more circulation its public, open invite links have received.

In the past few weeks, I’ve had the privilege of watching *MacStories* relaunch their premium membership program, *Club MacStories*, on their incredible bespoke CMS. Part of this launch included their first exclusive community space, on Discord, which has been deeply rewarding for me, personally, but has also highlighted some serious limitations of that service which I not-so-long-ago [advocated so heavily for](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison). Namely, **hyperlinks to specific messages** within Discord are a hopelessly problematic endeavor. Even for a public server like *Extratone*’s, navigating to a message link [like this example](https://discord.com/channels/107272441889341440/107272441889341440/893958033401593898) will require any and all users to log in to Discord on the web, which - on mobile devices, especially - seems to struggle to navigate to the precise position of the subject message after you’ve successfully done so. Slack’s public message links are smart enough at least to prompt users to open them Slack for iOS, but Telegram’s system for message links in public channels and groups makes both services look daft.

</audio>

Telegram message IDs are purely chronological from their channel/group chat’s creation - the first message in a channel or group chat is `1` and the 15th is `15`. Together with the simplicity of channel/group chat IDs, which are just their alphanumeric @ names, this format makes URL schemes for Telegram message links super malleable and easy to understand. The sixth message posted in the [@extratone channel](https://t.me/extratone), for instance, can be found at [https://t.me/extratone/6](https://t.me/extratone/6), which even those without Telegram installed can view natively within their web browser. Within Telegram clients, said links are ultra-responsive, regardless of whether or not one had previously “joined” the channel or group containing the message. 

![Orange Noir Telegram Theme by Valespace](https://i.snap.as/moymK7EY.png)

In *MacStories*’ case, there’s another essential point of reference. When I pinged the staff in their Discord regarding their experiences running [their now-abandoned Telegram channel](https://t.me/MacStories), John Voorhees replied:

> I don't really have anything to say about Telegram one way or the other. We ran it for a short time 5 years ago as an experiment and it didn't stick.

I wasn’t yet a subscriber in those days, but little details like [behind-the-scenes voice messages](https://t.me/MacStories/281) are definitely missed. [Federico’s initial audio introduction](https://t.me/MacStories/39) describes a potential for the channel I wish more readers had enjoyed. They’re much more intimate, even, than the publication’s new exluclusive Town Hall events on Discord, which doesn’t make much sense, I know. 

![Live Streams and Video Chats](https://i.snap.as/v1zhWmwN.png)

### Streaming

Admittedly, another attention-grabbing feature that contributed to my finally getting around to this Post was [the introduction of "Live Streams" for channels and groups](https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel) (really just a slight augmentation of their ["Voice Chats 2.0" features](https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats-on-steroids)) at the very end of this past August. Discord, of course, was way ahead of Telegram in implementing Voice Chats and Screen Sharing [back in October of 2017](https://youtu.be/mMloc55o1jc), and it's long since become one of the services' core features. However, *recording* live content of any kind is not natively supported, though there is a [handy utility bot named Craig](https://craig.chat) who can accomplish this for you. For the sake of transparency, I should admit that not a single one of my live streams on Discord has actually included any viewership, but I have participated in a handful of others’ and viewed a couple dozen.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1448837428534521858

For the past few months or so, participating in any sort of voice or video chat in Discord desktop has led to [a spectacular relaunch loop](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1448837428534521858) that can only be solved by reinstalling the application, entirely.[^7] It’s not that Discord for iOS’ now full support for such streaming - both in terms of participation and simple viewership - isn’t impressive, but honestly, *Telegram* for iOS’ superiority should be immediately obvious to anyone who’s tried them both, recently. Not just in pure capacity’s sense, but in moderation tools, shared link customization, and, obviously, native recording support. I’ve embedded two recordings of different test streams of mine, below. [The first](https://t.me/extratone/7054) (embedded in [YouTube form](https://youtu.be/uhXZZBl0fn8),) was streamed from both my Surface Laptop 2 and iPhone 12 Pro Max.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhXZZBl0fn8

[The second](https://t.me/extratone/7196) is a very brief recording (in native form [directly from *The Psalms*’ GitHub Repo](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/video/TelegramiOSLiveStreamTest.mp4)) of a stream I did *just* from the share screen function of my phone, in the wrong orientation.[^8]

<video controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/video/TelegramiOSLiveStreamTest.mp4">
</video>

Below is a screenshot of the recorded file’s metadata (as provided by Telegram for Windows.) 

![Telegram Live Stream Meta](https://i.snap.as/oDQqSYHF.png)

As you might note, there’s definitely something to be desired from the quality of Telegram’s stream recordings, especially in its included audio. I find it a bit strange that it’s recorded in 48 kHz just to be compressed down to *46kbps*. When you’ve stopped a recording, you’ll receive both the video file and just the extracted audio in an .ogg file. Unfortunately, the latter is no less compressed than it is combined in the video file. (Both are sent to one's Saved Messages channel immediately upon stopping a recording, from where they can be forwarded virtually anywhere.) Aside from a boost in audio quality, though, Discord’s default 720p base resolution is matched by Telegram. Via server boosts, this figure can be upgraded significantly, though the end result is quite costly. According to [a not necessarily trustworthy site](https://clutchpoints.com/discord-server-boost-cost/), accounting for Discord’s [recent reduction in boost requirements](https://www.facebook.com/discord/posts/4524749577592737), here’s the pricing laydown to boost a server (per month:) 

> …a total of $34.93 for Level 2 and $69.86 for Level 3. That’s $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3 for Nitro subscribers.

Among quite a few other abilities, here are the extracted audio/video requirements per server level **only**:

1. 128kbps audio/720p video upped to 60fps
2. 256kbps audio/1080p 60fps video
3. 384kpbs audio/no video boost

So, if I had the spare change to maintain a level 2 boost for *Extratone*’s Discord server, myself, I could do so for $34.93 per month, which would allow me to *stream* (not necessarily *record*) in 1080p/60fps video and 256kbps audio to up to [50 viewers](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040816151-Go-Live-and-Screen-Share) (as of this writing.) Theoretically, at no cost, I can stream with virtually identical features (though I prefer Telgram's) to my Telegram channel to [infinitely many users](https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel#unlimited-live-streams) in 1280p/30fps with absurdly low-quality audio and share/manipulate recordings natively/instantly from within any Telegram client. If I were All Powerful, I would make all the members of my "[Family Tech Support](https://bilge.world/ios-15-family-review)" iMessage group install Telegram on their devices so we could use it, instead. I would also make them collectively attend occasional live streams, where they could ask questions verbally of my demonstrations sharing my own screen, or even share their own screens to demonstrate an issue or provide context for a question. The reality, though, is that I do not expect any sort of anticipation for my personal live help events on any platform, which innately suggests Telegram over Discord, I'd argue, for when I *do* stream such content, given its total lack of investment.[^9]

![Location Sharing in Telegram for iOS](https://i.snap.as/FRj5GGPN.png)

### Location Sharing

One of Telegram's most unique (and potentially powerful, I believe) community features is [Live Location Sharing](https://telegram.org/blog/live-locations) on its mobile apps. Borned by Siberian native developer [Roman Pushkin](https://twitter.com/romanpushkin), LibreTaxi is the single truly exciting open ridesharing alternative I've ever encountered.[^10] As [an item for *CBC radio* from 2015](https://www.cbc.ca/radio/spark/346-biometrics-audio-intelligence-and-more-1.3987746/the-man-who-wants-to-out-uber-uber-1.3987987) (among other assorted coverage compiled [here](https://telegra.ph/LibreTaxi-press-coverage-07-14) as of July, 2017) explains, it utilizes Telegram's live location sharing functions to act as a decentralized Uber/Lyft alternative in the form of [a bot](https://telegram.me/libretaxi_bot), which connects users needing a ride with users providing them, free of any fees or service charges. Discourse surrounding LibreTaxi has been silent for years, but [this channel](https://t.me/s/libretaxi_all) tracking all LibreTaxi orders in realtime is proof that it *really is* helping folks get around.

*
As for the persistence of *Live* location-sharing, I can vouch for its reliability on the Android side, at least, as per my aforementioned experience with a partner who used Telegram and shared their location with me for both safety and convenience. As someone with the most immense possible privilege regarding safety and dating, I would also like to suggest sharing one's live location with a private Telegram group chat with friends as an alternative to service's like [Tinder's Noonlight](https://www.help.tinder.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039260031-What-is-Noonlight-).




![Chat Export in Telegram Desktop](https://i.snap.as/TbPFRPnG.png)

### Permanence

I've long evangelized (and extensively used) Alexey Golub's [Discord Chat Exporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) to make beautiful, stylized archives of Discord channels and/or entire servers for safekeeping. Telegram's native [Chat Export Tool](https://telegram.org/blog/export-and-more) came just a year after Alexey pushed [version 1.0 of the tool to GitHub](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter/releases/tag/1.0.0), in August of 2018. In features, they're very similar utilities: both can export in either stylized HTML or data-only JSON formats between infinitely-configurable time/date constraints. Again, I wouldn’t know how much external backup of community activity actually weighs in the day-to-day operations of large online communities. I know I personally find it comforting to have a swift, polished method of exporting *text*, especially, living in this era of [blatant disregard for users of suddenly-abandoned online services](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/79).

![TG Colors](https://i.snap.as/r0WpvFQr.png)

## ~~Transparency~~ Opacity

One of my primary justifications for the time spent in composing this Post has to do with the immediately-available discourse surrounding Telegram on the web, which is wholly incomplete, at best. The main obstruction, from my perspective, is the subject of **encryption**. Even within publications as legitimate and frankly out-of-scope as *Forbes*, one can find an article like my chosen example, from February of this year, entitled "[No, Don’t Quit WhatsApp To Use Telegram Instead—Here’s Why](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/02/13/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-instead-of-whatsapp-use-signal-or-apple-imessage)." It was written to address a mass "[exodus](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/24/whatsapp-loses-millions-of-users-after-terms-update)" of users from WhatsApp after [a grandiose misunderstanding](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification)(?) of its Privacy Policy caused a noisy controversy ([catalyzed by Idiot Melon, himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153).) I've been unable to find the added/altered text, itself, in my brief reading, but it's not as if the happening wasn't thoroughly covered elsewhere. It's not that I doubt the expertise of "Cybersecurity Expert Zak Doffman" when he notes "Telegram’s cloud-based architecture is a serious risk when compared to the end-to-end default encryption deployed by Signal and WhatsApp, which also uses Signal’s protocol," nor that I do not believe the following details are as true as truth gets:

> All group messages on Telegram are only encrypted between your device and Telegram’s cloud, your message history is stored on Telegram’s cloud, and if you ([unwisely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/01/30/stop-using-this-dangerous-whatsapp-setting-on-your-apple-iphone-or-google-android-phone/)) transfer your WhatsApp chat history to Telegram, then this is also stored on its cloud. Make you sure understand that Telegram has the decryption keys to any of your data that you store on its cloud...

To this argument and the many variations of it present in Telegram for iOS' [App Store reviews](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807), [obscure German PeerTube servers](https://tube.tchncs.de/w/2d958ef9-1be4-477c-bc13-852ec6391487), and even within [public chats on Telegram, itself](https://t.me/crackheadlegit/409), my formal response for the record is: *Okay! Affirmative! Received and understood!* I must acknowledge - given my own introduction to the service, narrated above - that Telegram's brand is vaguely associated with privacy and security. I can see that the second of nine duckies in the Ducky Grid on the root of telegram.org sits above the subhead "**Private**" and a caption with the following claim: "Telegram messages are heavily encrypted and can self-destruct." (The seventh ducky's subhead is "**Secure**.") Continuing on in Doffman's *Forbes* article, we find an overview of several vulnerabilities found throughout Telegram's native clients by Dhiraj Mishra - surely they with the most ghastly typographical preferences in all of cybersecurity - on their blog, *Input Zero*.[^6] The [specific example hyperlinked](https://www.inputzero.io/2020/12/telegram-privacy-fails-again.html) concerns a bug in the MacOS client that resulted in "the application leak[ing] the sandbox path where [a sent audio or video message] is stored in '.mp4' file." (The whole of the ghastly-typewritten summary is embedded below in screenshot form.)

![Telegram Privacy - InputZero](https://i.snap.as/a0xgY5cJ.png)

Just to be clear, I am being sincere when I acknowledge that these are genuinely problematic issues that no doubt affected real Telegram users who depend upon its Secret Chat function. Even something so benign as the file path to local media storage on my device is not something I'd want piggybacking my otherwise-anonymous, NDA- and/or law-breaking messages to a journalist, for instance, but frankly, I don't know of any journalists who maintain public Telegram contacts, anyway. Come to think of it, I don't think I've *ever* seen a Telegram username publicly associated with a journalist. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of anonymous modern messenger service tip lines advertised by news organizations and news people which I've come across have all linked to Signal. In this particular case, then, Mr. Elon’s advice is sound.

The question I would like to surface: **what if I have no use for encryption or privacy across my purposes for Telegram**? *All* the channels I have ever engaged with have been public, and those private ones I’ve come across have either been shady crypto spam channels or shady porn channels. I realize this doesn’t exactly reflect positively on Telegram’s community, but - as I argued regarding Discord, long ago - why let the community or even the app’s branding, itself, confine how you use it as a utility?

## A Hearty Foundation

My thinking while drafting this argument kept returning to a single, simple realization: **in age, Telegram is just two years ahead of Discord**, yet the various software distributed by the two organizations for their respective services represent quite disparate opinions in design terms. [Discord's desktop "application"](https://discord.com/download) is an Electron app - [Telegram's](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop) is virtually pure C++. [Telegram's iOS app](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS) is mostly written in Objective-C (I'm to assume the 30.8% Swift code number on the repo as of this writing is mostly comprised of its widgets/other recent iOS-specific integrations,) while Discord's is mostly ???. That is, because Discord's software is proprietary and the source is closed, all I can tell you is that it was written in React Native [as of December, 2018](https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-sticking-with-react-native-ccc34be0d427). What I *can* tell you is that the current build of [Discord for iOS on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord-talk-chat-hangout/id985746746) weighs in at 153.2 MB - significantly less than [Telegram's](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807) 185.1 MB. As I've noted plenty of times this year, **I am not a software developer** and therefore I can't promise you an app's initial payload size is actually all that relevant, but I was surprised to see Telegram wasn't slimmer than Discord, given how the two apps behave and my previous experiences with the platform, this year. 

![Storage Management - Telegram for iOS](https://i.snap.as/BecGI6kg.png)


Returning to the topic of their age… In its eight operating years, Telegram has embarked upon - and *actually completed*! - a gargantuan amount of projects. [Telegraph](https://telegra.ph/), the CMS, its [Web](http://web.telegram.org/), [Android](https://telegram.org/android), and [Linux](https://itsfoss.com/install-telegram-desktop-linux/) clients, [embeddedable comments widgets](https://comments.app), its [online theme creation tool](https://themes.telegram.org/), and on and on. Across their various types, Telegram’s software is universally simple, frugal, robust, and easy-to-use. Frankly, by contrast, Discord has done *nothing*? Though you’ll find openly-available solutions to accomplish much of what you can on Telegram in terms of moderation and other utilitarian concerns, like the aforementioned Craig bot, they are *all* the work of third-parties. While Discord the *company* is much more [transparently profiled](https://discord.com/company) on the web than “Telegram FZ LLC,” the latter’s actual work is very well documented [across GitHub](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger). 

![Telegram Desktop in Windows 11](https://i.snap.as/DFQzGGeZ.png)

If you’ve stuck with me this far, perhaps it’s not too much to ask that we retreat a bit and ask ourselves **what we’d truly like prioritized in community chat software for 2021**. I really do show my age in my bias, here, as someone just old enough to have had extensive experience using IRC,[^11] I think there’s a less-than-adequately discussed division happening which its successors might benefit dwelling on. IRC was extremely frugal and it was easy to find a freeware or FOSS IRC client for one’s given platform which was well-optimized to sit in the background of their desktop operating system, completely untouched and barely acknowledged visually for days… weeks… months at a time. It was easy to find oneself a member of a dozen or so IRC channels for specific interests, projects, or organizations averaging a dozen or so actual updates/pots per day, each. It was distinctly low pressure - many of my channel memberships functioned more like a wire service or, much more contemporarily, like an RSS aggregator, than a local party line.

![Telegram for iOS Sharing and Notifications](https://i.snap.as/FltrCV6Z.png)

As I see it, the ultimate shift dividing those solutions from these is the big fucking obvious one: IRC was conceived in a world where computers were mostly static objects associated by their intended use and physical dimensions with the referential, unmoving waypoints around which *we* orbited (the kitchen counter, the desk in your study at home, parallel series of workstations within the public library, etc.) The *entirely* contrasted needs of community engagement on a *handset* should have - in my opinion - done much more to break apart these communal contexts than they have. As prolifically and extensively as I have used Discord for iOS since before its official release, even, it is hopelessly compromised by its loyalty to the PC gamer’s paradigm. My 12 Pro Max is not just *capable* of keeping 100 Discord channels up-to-date in the background as I move about the world - it is all too fucking *eager*, and for not a one rational explanation. Going on down this vector eventually leads to an adjacent argument I’ll name but otherwise save for later: it is literally a decade past the time when  we should have ceased celebrating the fact that mobile computers had matched and outdone desktop computers! We have to snap the fuck out of our obsession with bringing desktop computing with our persons and refocus entirely (once again) on exploring what “mobile computing” can/should mean, going forward. Please God, help us do so ASAP.

It’s been three years since I first discovered iPhone-bound personal automation in a late build from iOS 12’s *Public* Beta channel, having skipped pout on the entire cycle for the first release in a good while.

Don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable, but I live in Columbia, MO, and would basically love the opportunity to frame it as …. not like “grass roots software,” or anything… idk. I guess I would like to think the fact that Min’s developmental priorities make so much more sense (for my own use, yes, but also for the average user’s) than any other web browser I’ve ever encountered might have something to do with its creators’ distance from the Wacky Fantasy World on the West Coast.

(so far.) just makes everybody else’s insistence on using browser extensions to accomplish this look utterly daft lmao

Hey, thanks! I’m not sure how much the development priorities are a result of location (and I just moved here a year ago, so I’m not really a “missourian”), but it’s good to know it’s working well for you!
The CLI integration was a result of extensions being too much work to support, rather than an intentional design decision 🙂 And you end up missing a bunch of features present in the real extension. But the installation flow does work pretty well.

> almost as if thought aimed at working around constraints leads to clever solutions… hehe ❤️ 1Password has grown in completely irrelevant, cloud-native features ((*password sharing*??? wtf???)) whilst letting their actual software (as in… the Windows client) rot to hell. makes for a wonderful combination, as you might imagine. I was a 1Password beta tester when I was like 15 or something… it was the entirety of password management as a concept (as far as I was concerned) for years and years. I cannot tell you how many people I have annoyed to death with 1Password evangelism in my lifetime and yet…

> Enpass is more dependable and far quicker in (my) real world anyway.

# Easily Converting Apple News Links to Their Original URLs

Hey again guys. This is the first of a series of tips messages involving Siri Shortcuts. If you’ve never downloaded one from me before, you’ll probably need to go through the “Allow Untrusted Shortcuts” process documented here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210628

If you use Apple News at all and ever want to share a given article you’ve read with someone who *doesn’t have it*, your only option up to this point has been manually searching it out on the web and copying the URL.

…until now. My Apple News ⇨ Safari Shortcut is actually a simplification of another one, but essentially it allows you to open the original link of a given article (if it exists - all Apple News-exclusive content won’t work) in Safari with just *two taps*.

https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/d80c98b95fca4c6e87b51cdaaf45a4e6

(This is probably the least useful Shortcut on my brief list to share with and demonstrate for you so… Have faith lol) 
# I Trust Telegram

![Patel Clouds Theme in the Chat Background Tool](https://i.snap.as/9Bxz27ZX.png)

## How I’ve used Telegram as the ultimate cross-platform Universal Clipboard, file sharing service, and more.

Believe it or not, I, too originally sought the Russian-owned, cross-platform-as-hell messaging service for “privacy” - or perhaps *solitude* would be more apt. It was in 2017, amidst the shock that the Tump Presidency was *actually going to happen* [^1], that I happened to hear about his pick for Secretary of Education, Betsy DeVos, whom had just 18 months prior led myself and some twenty thousand other poor souls in a most capitalist prayer to the Christian God for prosperity at her pyramid scheme’s ultimate “superbowl” gathering in Cincinatti. I had decided to “infiltrate” AMWAY under the ridiculous assumption that I might be able to contribute some new insight in writing critically about what I might witness. (In truth, I found my experiences that summer so utterly traumatic, existentially, that I never was able to do so.) I don’t know what consequences of her ascension to the Lord of American Schooling I expected to happen, but I was pretty hysterical about it - that is, more unhumorously alarmed about some grander world happening as I’d ever been by a long shot. For the first and only time in memory, I felt compelled to take some sort of malicious, obscured action - to organize somehow for a purpose other than to be publicly critical of this person, and to use my knowledge about digital media to the fullest possible extent to scrutinize her administration’s every movement and to be prepared, even, to take some sort of real action if she… well, I don’t know. I *didn’t* know anything, really, about anti-government organization, generally, but I was not acting rationally in the slightest.[^2]

![White Sapphire](https://i.snap.as/aNADRjvK.png)

I’m bringing this up for a few reasons, and the fact that the very first digital decision of my personal hysteria was to set up a private Telegram channel is telling, though I can’t recall just how much or how little I actually knew about it at the time. I launched myself back to the channel’s very beginning (easier to do with regular URLs than in any other service I’ve ever encountered,) but was only able to bring myself to dig just long enough to grab the utterly absurd photograph above… Though I certainly did not consider myself actively *interested in automation* at the time,[^3] Telegram’s infamous bot ecosystem proved so prevalent (and accessible,) that I was able to configure at least three bots on that channel within days of first establishing it: a repeater hooked to DeVos’ Twitter account, an RSS-powered bot watching the main feed of a website set up by Senator Elizabeth Warren called [*DeVos Watch*](https://www.warren.senate.gov/oversight/devos-watch), and another republishing everything from [the Department of Education’s press releases feed](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases). 

Was any of it genuinely useful in helping me maintain *Action Readiness* in hypothetical defense of American education? Most certainly not. It was, however, genuinely *comforting* to have such diligent, automated minions keeping watch - to have a centralized, private, reliable, and purely-chronological feed of information in a super-handy location, regardless of whether or not it was usable. As I began to unconsciously integrate Telegram into my day-to-day online life on both of my PCs and my iPhone, the usefulness of my private channel for *other* applications became rapidly apparent. On iOS, not even dedicated file managers like DEVONthink are capable (or *willing* might be a more accurate term) of handling the diversity of data Telegram will happily pass on for you, *especially* through the Share Sheet.

## Drafting

I have used this “flow” so extensively for so long that it has come to define the whole of the abstract method in my muscle memory. Observe me browsing the web on my phone in an exhausted or particularly distractible state and you’d probably catch at least one or two completely irrational, inexplicable instances of sharing to my “[Saved Messages](https://telegram.org/blog/albums-saved-messages)” Telegram channel, which would be problematic for just about any other link-saving service. Add too many links to Safari’s Read Later list and you’ll end up crashing the browser on your Mac. I don’t even feel comfortable sending links willy nilly to the brilliant bookmark managing/curatorial service Raindrop, these days, after finding out that my [Reading List feed](https://raindrop.io/davidblue/reading-list-13380406) has *actual daily followers*, but there are zero consequences to sending ultimately-worthless or duplicate links to my personal Telegram channel, which has no content limit and is instantly and competently searchable.

![Send to Telegram Drafts Action](https://i.snap.as/p3K96LiX.png)

Over the years, I’ve discovered a bunch of other uses for the Saved Messages channel. As demonstrated in the screenshots embedded above, the [Send to Telegram Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E) for my writing app, Drafts, utilizes Telegram for iOS’ Universal Links support (in the format `tg://…`) to instantly send the whole text of the current document in Drafts to a Telegram channel of one’s choice. I suspect this was intended to streamline posting for admins of public channels, but I’ve used it to quickly “back up” work as well as to transfer edits directly to my (Windows-running) PC. By adding `&to=+[my phone number]` to the end of the action’s URL, I was able to remove the single, unnecessary step of choosing the destination chat. Because text messages are automatically split at 5000 characters, though, I usually depend on the [Share as Markdown File Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1V4) (the output of which I also send to Saved Messages through the Share Sheet) for the latter function.

I found my inspiration for this Post in replying to a [thread on the Automators.fm Discourse forum](https://talk.automators.fm/t/equivalent-to-drafts-but-for-windows/6159) regarding a Windows equivlalent to the same Mac/iOS/iPadOS app Drafts mentioned above. I suppose my reply was a bit off-topic, in retrospect, but still worth including:

> I have been using [**Telegram**](https://desktop.telegram.org/), of all things for years. Notably, if you hit Ctrl + 0 from *anywhere* in the Windows client, you and your cursor are taken to the compose field beneath your personal "Saved Messages" channel, which is searchable, has an extremely high per-message character limit (after which it just automatically splits,) and is ridiculously reliable in saving "drafts" live as you're typing. As in... I have actively tried to lose characters by killing the application and then logging in on my phone and have yet to accomplish losing a single one (among other advantages: zero formatting added to plain text by default - not even line breaks - no total file limit and *2GB* per file limit uploads, absurdly cross-platform, literally more reliable than SMS in poor network conditions.) You can immediately reenter a sent message with `↑` to edit, copy it, escape with just `Esc` and then paste to start a new revision. 

The feature within Telegram that makes this whole usecase worthwhile was introduced in [June, 2016](https://telegram.org/blog/drafts), and is entitled - appropriately - “Drafts.” Unlike the Drafts function in Twitter’s various native clients, for instance, Telegram’s really is impossible to fool, though it’s not perfect. [Markdown formatting support](https://telegra.ph/markdown-07-07) is inconsistent across Telegram clients - the iOS app being the most woeful - and the few keyboard shortcuts the app supports on iPad are not supported whatsoever on iPhone.

## Universal Clipboard

Users familiar with the MacOS + iOS + iPadOS ecosystem should be well-acquainted with “[Universal Clipboard](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209460),” which instantly synchronizes clipboard content across Apple devices. More recently, Android + Windows users have supposedly had access to an [equivalent functionality](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/seamlessly-transfer-content-between-your-devices-8a0ead3c-2f15-1338-66ca-70cf4ae81fcb#WindowsVersion=Windows_10). To my knowledge, though, truly cross-platform clipboard sync has yet to be realized.[^4] As someone who’s used iOS and Windows regularly - along with Linux, occasionally - for more than a decade, now, I’d put my full weight behind Telegram as the best available solution from (far too much) personal experience.

![Security Considerations in Telegram for iOS](https://i.snap.as/Qim9gsZZ.png)

When first entering a new system, real or virtual, regardless of OS, my very first step upon completion of its setup process has for years been to install Telegram, largely because all of my passwords for any/all given services are huge - 30+ characters, at least - and complex enough that typing them out is both tricky and absurdly time-consuming. Authorizing a new Telegram client, however, is as simple as entering a one-time numeric passcode or scanning a QR code. Managing logged-in sessions (see: the far right screenshot embedded above) is quick, reliable, and includes a handy button to kill all but the current session. Thanks to these considerations, I feel quite comfortable sending myself passwords in Telegram, including .csv exports of whole password vaults, when it’s appropriate, even when working on systems I do not own. For this function, I can’t think of any other service/software capable of replacing Telegram.

For day-to-day hyperlink sharing across my platforms, a variety of alternatives continue to come and go. The “Send to [device]” features represented throughout the palette of available web browsers - Firefox, Opera, Edge Chromium, Chrome, etc. - aren’t exactly reliable, in my experience. Most recently, I discovered a service specific to Hewlett Packard machines called “[QuickDrop](https://www.hp.com/us-en/solutions/quickdrop-photo-sharing-app.html),” which - along with [its accompanying iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/hp-quickdrop/id1495071972) - does indeed allow me to send files, links, and text between my iPhone and Big Boy HP tower, though even my brief testing was filled with inexplicable prompts to reauthenticate and intermittent hangups, neither of which lend easily to regular use. I still maintain high hopes for [Snapdrop](https://snapdrop.net/), which allows devices to share files and text over a *local* network from within any web browser, but it, too, is prone to frustrating hangups.

## File Transfer & Cloud Backup

Amidst the saga of my failed move to Portland spanning 2017-2019, I ended up losing *all* of my physical file storage - my old desktop and its hard drive, as well as 3 external drives containing a bunch of raw video I probably wouldn’t have gotten around to using, anyway, site backups for *Extratone*, and who knows what else. This loss taught me many grand, metaphysical life lessons (I hope,) but more practically, it affirmed a (admittedly gluttonous) truth about digital assets: if one truly wishes to make a file permanent, they must back it up in as many different places as possible.[^5] Perhaps the single most durable of these in my own computing life to date has been Telegram, which still has no per-account file upload limit and a per-file size limit of *two gigabytes*. The amount of pre-2019 work I’ve recovered solely thanks to Telegram is too great to enumerate here, but a rough draft of my [2018 Thankful for Bandcamp Mix](https://pod.link/1437549809/episode/626a66d3f37807b69c59f56faa4d3b94) comes immediately to mind.

How exactly the service is able to maintain this virtually unrestricted storage, infrastructurally, borders on *don’t want to know* status. My own net server impact as a user is fairly difficult to estimate, but I’d bet real paper currency it’s between 50 and 100 GB, the vast majority of which I uploaded several years ago. Within any mainstream cloud file storage service - Dropbox, Google Drive, Box, iCloud, etc. - the cost of storing that amount *over time* would have added up to a not-insignificant chunk of change. I don’t want to advocate for Telegram as a cloud storage replacement for loaded cheapskates, but for working-class users on a $0 budget, it can be counted upon to keep large files in a relatively shareable, ultra cross-platform, and super-accessible manner. Students, especially, should take note.

![Live Streams and Video Chats](https://i.snap.as/v1zhWmwN.png)

## Community

At this point in my life, I must acknowledge to both readers and myself that **I am completely inept at community organization**. Especially when it comes to grand suggestions about how I suppose online communities might be ideally-run or just better served by particular software environments and configurations, I have literally received *zero* positive feedback, and not because I haven’t spent significant time positing publicly within the space. I spent the first half of my twenties trying to Peter Pan an independent online music magazine into existence, written by fresh-minded youths on the fringe at 140% throttle and managed to accomplish startlingly little for my all my invested time and gumption. The relevant component of that tale was a significant and all-out commitment from the beginning to run the whole project entirely within Discord. 

The one absent activity throughout my years of Telegram use - save for intermittent correspondence during one relationship - has been *messaging other users*. I managed to find and participate in a few group chats - “[Telegram iOS Talk](https://t.me/TelegramiOStalk)” and [*It's FOSS*' official channel](https://t.me/itsfoss_official), notably - in my preparation/research for this post. I’ve discovered plenty of new clever bits, like the button to jump to one’s nearest mention in a chat. I’ve also done my best to actually apply some [much-needed administrative attention](https://t.me/columbiamo/7774) to [my years-old attempt](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/c4na0v/local_telegram_group_chat_for_columbia) at creating the [definitive location-based local group chat](https://telegram.org/blog/contacts-local-groups) for the Mid-Missouri area where I live. Truthfully… It [hasn’t exactly gone as I’d hoped](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/q0843f/local_telegram_group_chat), but the failures have been all my own. I have yet to find a satisfactory balance in terms of moderation bots, so I’ve (as of this writing) resorted to manually removing the (significant) spam bot traffic by hand. Also, I must admit that I’ve never had to do so more than once or twice on *Extratone*’s public Discord, despite how much more circulation its public, open invite links have received.

In the past few weeks, I’ve had the privilege of watching *MacStories* relaunch their premium membership program, *Club MacStories*, on their incredible bespoke CMS. Part of this launch included their first exclusive community space, on Discord, which has been deeply rewarding for me, personally, but has also highlighted some serious limitations of that service which I not-so-long-ago [advocated so heavily for](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison). Namely, **hyperlinks to specific messages** within Discord are a hopelessly problematic endeavor. Even for a public server like *Extratone*’s, navigating to a message link [like this example](https://discord.com/channels/107272441889341440/107272441889341440/893958033401593898) will require any and all users to log in to Discord on the web, which - on mobile devices, especially - seems to struggle to navigate to the precise position of the subject message after you’ve successfully done so. Slack’s public message links are smart enough at least to prompt users to open them Slack for iOS, but Telegram’s system for message links in public channels and groups makes both services look daft.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/Voice%20Notes/DiscordFuckery.mp3">
</audio>

Telegram message IDs are purely chronological from their channel/group chat’s creation - the first message in a channel or group chat is `1` and the 15th is `15`. Together with the simplicity of channel/group chat IDs, which are just their alphanumeric @ names, this format makes URL schemes for Telegram message links super malleable and easy to understand. The sixth message posted in the [@extratone channel](https://t.me/extratone), for instance, can be found at [https://t.me/extratone/6](https://t.me/extratone/6), which even those without Telegram installed can view natively within their web browser. Within Telegram clients, said links are ultra-responsive, regardless of whether or not one had previously “joined” the channel or group containing the message. 

![Orange Noir Telegram Theme by Valespace](https://i.snap.as/moymK7EY.png)

In MacStories’ case, there’s another essential point of reference. When I pinged the staff in their Discord regarding their experiences running [their now-abandoned Telegram channel](https://t.me/MacStories), John Voorhees replied:

> I don't really have anything to say about Telegram one way or the other. We ran it for a short time 5 years ago as an experiment and it didn't stick.

I wasn’t yet a subscriber in those days, but little details like [behind-the-scenes voice messages](https://t.me/MacStories/281) are definitely missed. [Federico’s initial audio introduction](https://t.me/MacStories/39) describes a potential for the channel I wish more readers had enjoyed. They’re much more intimate, even, than the publication’s new exluclusive Town Hall events on Discord, which doesn’t make much sense, I know. 

![Live Streams and Video Chats](https://i.snap.as/v1zhWmwN.png)

Admittedly, another attention-grabbing feature that contributed to my finally getting around to this Post was [the introduction of "Live Streams" for channels and groups](https://telegram.org/blog/live-streams-forwarding-next-channel) (really just a slight augmentation of their ["Voice Chats 2.0" features](https://telegram.org/blog/voice-chats-on-steroids)) at the very end of this past August. Discord, of course, was way ahead of Telegram in implementing Voice Chats and Screen Sharing [back in October of 2017](https://youtu.be/mMloc55o1jc), and it's long since become one of the services' core features. However, *recording* live content of any kind is not natively supported, though there is a [handy utility bot named Craig](https://craig.chat) who can accomplish this for you.

## ~~Transparency~~ Opacity

One of my primary justifications for the time spent in composing this Post has to do with the immediately-available discourse surrounding Telegram on the web, which is wholly incomplete, at best. The main obstruction, from my perspective, is the subject of **encryption**. Even within publications as legitimate and frankly out-of-scope as *Forbes*, one can find an article like my chosen example, from February of this year, entitled "[No, Don’t Quit WhatsApp To Use Telegram Instead—Here’s Why](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/02/13/why-you-should-stop-using-telegram-instead-of-whatsapp-use-signal-or-apple-imessage)." It was written to address a mass "[exodus](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/24/whatsapp-loses-millions-of-users-after-terms-update)" of users from WhatsApp after [a grandiose misunderstanding](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification)(?) of its Privacy Policy caused a noisy controversy ([catalyzed by Idiot Melon, himself](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347165127036977153).) I've been unable to find the added/altered text, itself, in my brief reading, but it's not as if the happening wasn't thoroughly covered elsewhere. It's not that I doubt the expertise of "Cybersecurity Expert Zak Doffman" when he notes "Telegram’s cloud-based architecture is a serious risk when compared to the end-to-end default encryption deployed by Signal and WhatsApp, which also uses Signal’s protocol," nor that I do not believe the following details are as true as truth gets:

> All group messages on Telegram are only encrypted between your device and Telegram’s cloud, your message history is stored on Telegram’s cloud, and if you ([unwisely](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2021/01/30/stop-using-this-dangerous-whatsapp-setting-on-your-apple-iphone-or-google-android-phone/)) transfer your WhatsApp chat history to Telegram, then this is also stored on its cloud. Make you sure understand that Telegram has the decryption keys to any of your data that you store on its cloud...

To this argument and the many variations of it present in Telegram for iOS' [App Store reviews](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807), [obscure German PeerTube servers](https://tube.tchncs.de/w/2d958ef9-1be4-477c-bc13-852ec6391487), and even within [public chats on Telegram, itself](https://t.me/crackheadlegit/409), my formal response for the record is: *Okay! Affirmative! Received and understood!* I must acknowledge - given my own introduction to the service, narrated above - that Telegram's brand is vaguely associated with privacy and security. I can see that the second of nine duckies in the Ducky Grid on the root of telegram.org sits above the subhead "**Private**" and a caption with the following claim: "Telegram messages are heavily encrypted and can self-destruct." (The seventh ducky's subhead is "**Secure**.") Continuing on in Doffman's *Forbes* article, we find an overview of several vulnerabilities found throughout Telegram's native clients by Dhiraj Mishra - surely they with the most ghastly typographical preferences in all of cybersecurity - on their blog, *Input Zero*.[^6] The [specific example hyperlinked](https://www.inputzero.io/2020/12/telegram-privacy-fails-again.html) concerns a bug in the MacOS client that resulted in "the application leak[ing] the sandbox path where [a sent audio or video message] is stored in '.mp4' file." (The whole of the ghastly-typewritten summary is embedded below in screenshot form.)

![Telegram Privacy - InputZero](https://i.snap.as/a0xgY5cJ.png)

Just to be clear, I am being sincere when I acknowledge that these are genuinely problematic issues that no doubt affected real Telegram users who depend upon its Secret Chat function. Even something so benign as the file path to local media storage on my device is not something I'd want piggybacking my otherwise-anonymous, NDA- and/or law-breaking messages to a journalist, for instance, but frankly, I don't know of any journalists who maintain public Telegram contacts, anyway. Come to think of it, I don't think I've *ever* seen a Telegram username publicly associated with a journalist. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of anonymous modern messenger service tip lines advertised by news organizations and news people which I've come across have all linked to Signal. In this particular case, then, Mr. Elon’s advice is sound.

The question I would like to surface: **what if I have no use for encryption or privacy across my purposes for Telegram**? *All* the channels I have ever engaged with have been public, and those private ones I’ve come across have either been shady crypto spam channels or shady porn channels. I realize this doesn’t exactly reflect positively on Telegram’s community, but - as I argued regarding Discord, long ago - why let the community or even the app’s branding, itself, confine how you use it as a utility?

## A Hearty Foundation

My thinking while drafting this argument kept returning to a single, simple realization: **in age, Telegram is just two years ahead of Discord**, yet the various software distributed by the two organizations for their respective services represent quite disparate opinions in design terms. [Discord's desktop "application"](https://discord.com/download) is an Electron app - [Telegram's](https://github.com/telegramdesktop/tdesktop) is virtually pure C++. [Telegram's iOS app](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger/Telegram-iOS) is mostly written in Objective-C (I'm to assume the 30.8% Swift code number on the repo as of this writing is mostly comprised of its widgets/other recent iOS-specific integrations,) while Discord's is mostly ???. That is, because Discord's software is proprietary and the source is closed, all I can tell you is that it was written in React Native [as of December, 2018](https://blog.discord.com/why-discord-is-sticking-with-react-native-ccc34be0d427). What I *can* tell you is that the current build of [Discord for iOS on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/discord-talk-chat-hangout/id985746746) weighs in at 153.2 MB - significantly less than [Telegram's](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807) 185.1 MB. As I've noted plenty of times this year, **I am not a software developer** and therefore I can't promise you an app's initial payload size is actually all that relevant, but I was surprised to see Telegram wasn't slimmer than Discord, given how the two apps behave and my previous experiences with the platform, this year. 

![Storage Management - Telegram for iOS](https://i.snap.as/BecGI6kg.png)


Returning to the topic of their age… In its eight operating years, Telegram has embarked upon - and *actually completed*! - a gargantuan amount of projects. Telegraph, the CMS, its Web, Android, and LInux clients, [embeddedable comments widgets](https://comments.app), its online theme creation tool, and on and on. Across their various types, Telegram’s software is universally simple, frugal, robust, and easy-to-use. Frankly, by contrast, Discord has done *nothing*? Though you’ll find openly-available solutions to accomplish much of what you can on Telegram in terms of moderation and other utilitarian concerns, like the aforementioned Craig bot, they are *all* the work of third-parties. While Discord the *company* is much more [transparently profiled](https://discord.com/company) on the web than “Telegram FZ LLC,” the latter’s actual work is very well documented [across GitHub](https://github.com/TelegramMessenger).

[1] I still have not accepted this, by the way. I’m still back there.
[2] If I were to be 100% sincere, I might ask you to consider that this (hilariously brief) intent was a method of coping with the great existential truths I was facing for the first time.
[3] I *definitey* was, though. For whatever reason, I do not remember associating the term “automation” with such activities, but I just found the “receipt” for my “purchase” of [IFTTT for iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ifttt/id660944635)… From July, 2013.
[4] I am currently working on a less-than-instant solution using iCloud and CopyQ’s clipboard sync function.
[5] I would’ve said “one can never have too many backups,” but the result of such thinking is ridiculously wasteful and not something I actually want to encourage.
[6] I'm almost positive I've heard of/been linked to this blog before, which is perhaps only notable in that I managed to keep my typographic opinions to myself.

# SI on Discord Regarding Objective-C and Swift

* [Original Post](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345707395907635/898349119725269053)

In the case of Tweetbot and Drafts, they have been around long enough that they simply were originally written in Objective-C (because Swift wasn’t a thing yet) - but they both contain some parts in Swift (especially Drafts).

It’s important to note that Swift, Objective-C and C are interoperable, meaning you can use them together without much effort. So it doesn’t really matter (though a well written purely C app will probably perform better than a well written Swift app, but writing a well written C app is harder)

This isn’t the case with other languages, like for example JavaScript, since it requires a JavaScript engine (written in C, probably) to run the code. That’s also the reason why Electron apps usually use more resources, etc.

> hey thank you! I did not know that regular C was also tossed into the mix. I suppose I was asking under the narrative context of iOS’ transition to Swift from  Objective-C. when I asked the Tapbots guys about whether or not Tweetbot was written in Objective-C, they responded as if there was no other way for them… as if Swift is icky. idk I could have misinterpreted.
> I was also under the impression that Tweetbot 6 was entirely rewritten from scratch… in Objective-C. which seems like a very opinionated choice.

You’re welcome ☺️ Happy to share my knowledge <:goodstat:879872135068262401> Different developers have different preferences and usually care deeply about the way they like to work - so it’s very possible you interpreted them correctly 😅

Even if it was rewritten from scratch in Objective-C, it’s not purely Objective-C, since the widgets for example can only be written in Swift (and SwiftUI, not UIKit)
# Windows 11 Family Message

So Windows 11 updates are going to be available starting *tomorrow*! I’ve been playing with it on and off for much of this year but there’s not too much to say other than… beneath the few flash features (trying widgets again, better desktop zones, a new look all-around,) Microsoft really did invest time in actually fixing/smoothing out stuff to an extent that - in my opinion, at least - a much smoother, more robust feeling Windows *is* the headline feature.

The one thing I’d note - they’re relaunching their store as the “Microsoft Store,” and it’s going to be pretty well saturated with scammy paid apps. I would STRONGLY suggest ultra-hesitance before spending any money on the new store. The vast majority of the legitimate applications (including an Alexa app, which I have yet to try) are completely free - you shouldn’t even need to set up billing information to download them. If you do find a paid app that looks worth it, make sure you verify the publisher is legit both within the store *and* on the publisher’s website. 

Notably, **I will literally do this for you any time**. It’s not knowledge-heavy work, or anything, but it can be tedious. It’d be a bonus if you could share prospective software with me here so that others can refer back in the future.

I don’t think any of you have any Windows-running computers old enough for their Windows 11 eligibility to be in question, but let me know if you do and I’ll check.

If you’re like me and hate system update prompts just appearing out of the blue, I’ll do my best to let you know as soon as it becomes available in the Windows Update settings menu in Windows 10. When that time comes, all you’ll need to do is start a search for “update” or “windows update” in the Start menu and the only result should be the right one. From there, using the `Check for updates` button should get the process started, though it might take a while.
# Notes-Telegram

## General
* **Telegram and Discord are the same age**
* Telegram’s cross-platform, resource-frugal clients and phone number-based accounts/auth literally make it more **class mobile** than Discord.
* What in fuck is this website… “[Telegram for iOS - NONE](http://tsfkb.wikidot.com/apps:ios)”
* My [personal Telegram satellite GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/t)
* [Send to Telegram Drafts Action](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/18E)
* [r/columbiamo - Local Telegram Group Chat for Columbia](https://reddit.com/r/columbiamo/comments/c4na0v/local_telegram_group_chat_for_columbia/)
* Relative link to messages that don't involve complex scripting.
* Unlimited file upload limit - **2GB PER FILE LIMIT**.
* Cross-platform as all fuck.
* Every programming/scripting language ever has at least a few (probably unfinished and abandoned) projects in the wild building support for Telegram APIs.
* Drafts as a safe dependable space to compose text does not have a windows equivalent, but Telegram can sort of function in that regard, largely because it continuously saves what one types in the text field. 
* Element … or Matrix… or whatever the actual protocol is called… is nothing but a great way to waste your time and the planet’s energy in obfuscating willy nilly. 
* Perhaps I should have accepted long ago that my particular priorities are *not* as resonant with other users as I would like to believe.
* Notification management in Telegram as well considered as I’ve ever experienced, which makes a lot of sense now that I am a long time user.
* When I lost all my shit in Portland, much of what was saved was thanks to Telegram.
* The particular features that define Telegram’s competence are not immediately obvious, for the most part. Being able to quickly change the recipient of a forwarded message, for instance,
* Telegram is notably lacking in translation support considering it's such an international space.

[Equivalent To Drafts, But For Windows?](https://talk.automators.fm/t/equivalent-to-drafts-but-for-windows/6159/8) - Windows - Automators Talk

* Shared on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Telegram/comments/pvd7a4/telegram_as_universal_clipboard_manager_ultimate/)

This is going to seem entirely out of left field, but for those looking for that OG function of Drafts... as just a safe place to compose text you intend to use elsewhere (as opposed to the Tweet compose interface, which just lost me like 15 minutes of typing, which led me here... hehe,) 

I have been using [**Telegram**](https://desktop.telegram.org/), of all things for years. notably, if you hit Ctrl + 0 from *anywhere* in the Windows client, you and your cursor are taken to the compose field beneath your personal "Saved Messages" channel, which is searchable, has an extremely high per-message character limit (after which it just automatically splits,) and is ridiculously reliable in saving "drafts" live as you're typing. as in... I have actively tried to lose characters by killing the application and then logging in on my phone and have yet to accomplish losing a single one (among other advantages: zero formatting added to plain text by default - not even line breaks - no total file limit and *2GB* per file limit uploads, absurdly cross-platform, literally more reliable than SMS in poor network conditions.) you can immediately reenter a sent message with `↑` to edit, copy it, escape with just `Esc` and then paste to start a new revision.

my other suggestion which I would personally use for this if I wasn't such a high-intensity clipboard user:
God's great gift to man, [**CopyQ**](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/,) is an extremely robust and infinitely customizable clipboard manager that supports complex scripting and.... somehow... I just managed to set up live syncing of my CopyQ clipboard over *iCloud for Windows*, and you absolutely would not believe how well it actually works.

as far as *send to yourself* functions… Telegram’s is the absolute most capable and usable by far, I promise. here’s more explanation in the form of this response I posted yesterday (I don’t expect anyone to actually engage with it though lol.) https://talk.automators.fm/t/equivalent-to-drafts-but-for-windows/6159/8

# “”””Privacy”””” (Telegram)

The one absent activity throughout my years of Telegram use - save for intermittent correspondence during one relationship - has been *messaging other users*. I managed to find and participate in at least one group chat - “[Telegram iOS Talk](https://t.me/TelegramiOStalk)” - in my preparation/research for this post
# Highlights x Hypothes.is Feedback

so this is a big stretch, but I thought I’d mention it considering my doing so in the Command Browser Discord seemed to provoke a somewhat-constructive discussion.

there’s a service called *Hypothesis* (https://web.hypothes.is) which has been my personal favorite attempt to create a universal “social annotation” service. they’ve got browser extensions but are (imo) in serious need of *any* support on iOS/iPadOS. I’m not a developer, but from what I can deduce, it looks like their APIs are well-documented and just waiting for an auspicious developer to come along and utilize.

I know I would personally *kill* for a smoother method of using Hypothesis on my iPhone…

just a thought.
# Opera for iOS App Store Review

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/135002426-21ad69a9-d2b7-4001-9ddc-fcafdc4ae11a.png)

## Speed and Frugality are No Joke

I have absolutely no idea how - considering all browsers on iOS are WebKit based - but this is *by far* the *fastest browser on this operating system*. If *speed* is truly your number one priority above all other considerations when browsing the web, here ya go. Frankly, I’ve continued to be bewildered for years, now, as to why general tech media has not mentioned Opera - or its “gaming browser” experimental counterpart, Opera GX - if not for any other reason than to chide it. It’s one of the few interesting questions within the subject of web browsing software at the moment.

Unfortunately, Opera is literally the only browser I’ve found with *absolutely zero* Bluetooth keyboard support. I use a hardware keyboard with my *iPhone* every day, so it is pretty much a non-option for me.

(Hey devs: you ever have a rainy day or something, look into UIKeyCommand.)

## [SYSTEM COLORS Telegram Themes](https://telegra.ph/SYSTEM-COLORS-Themes-for-iOS-Bound-Telegram-09-27)

Make no mistake - I did virtually nothing to create the following themes, nor do I know anything about Telegram theme development, generally. Frankly, I shouldn’t have even taken the time to whip *these* up, but I wanted to at least dip my toe in the experience for [a strangely sentimental essay I’ve been working on](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/228) about the service’s service in my working life.

https://t.me/extratone/6496

The one thing I *did* do is track down the most accurate translation of [iOS’ core system colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/) in hex I could find, which I spammed in each reasonably-generateable format all over every dead end group chat and channel I once created and have (shamefully) subsequently neglected and forgotten on this service.

```
--color-pink: #ff2d55;
--color-purple: #5856d6;
--color-orange: #ff9500;
--color-yellow: #ffcc00;
--color-red: #ff3b30;
--color-teal-blue: #5ac8fa;
--color-blue: #007aff;
--color-green: #4cd964;
```

I originally started using the [Big Boy Editor](https://themes.contest.com) and immediately realized that there is no apparent means of translating the iOS themes I’d found recently into .tdesktop themes without 1.) implementing an unofficial, but highly tedious translation matrix between the entirely different formats, or just 2.) fuckin eyeballing it.

* [SYSTEM RED](https://t.me/addtheme/systemred)
* [SYSTEM GREEN](https://t.me/addtheme/systemgreen)
* [SYSTEM ORANGE](https://t.me/addtheme/systemorange)

I started with [perhaps the best light theme for this app I’ve ever found](https://t.me/addtheme/tgbetacore) in terms of ultimate legibility in blinding sunlight, loading its (apparently early iOS-inspired?) style as a duplicate in the Bitch Mode “editor” found within the iOS app, itself. Then, I simply replaced its singular hex color asset with the equivalents you see above in the three classes to which it was assigned…

# The Pinterest Machine - MacStories Discord

not sure if you guys will find this as interesting as I do but…

I’ve been using my mom’s 16GB first-generation iPad Air on and off occasionally (which I’ve mentioned here before as The Pinterest Machine… the Screen Time data was utterly ridiculous when I first looked.) it’s running iOS 12.5.4 and honestly I still cannot believe how well it still functions as a tablet. 

to be honest, exploring Siri Shortcuts as they were, then, as someone who didn’t actually pay iOS-bound automation until 2019 or so… it’s fascinating to me how different the priorities were.

# The Agony & The Ecstasy of the iPhone 12 Pro Max

![Big Boy; Big Phone](https://i.snap.as/KtqMF5Ky.jpg)

Precisely 4750 days ago (give or take a few hours,) my First Generation iPhone was activated on an exceptionally cold Saturday – January 19th, 2008, a little over a week before my 14th birthday. In the time since, Apple has spread [over 1 Billion of these devices](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253162/iphone-users-total-number-billion-apple-tim-cook-q1-2021) across this planet. The Internet that gave that first device the i in its name has expanded by a factor of twenty or more. Consumer technology’s future seemed more and more exciting up to a point (I have always said iOS7, but obviously, it varies) when progress suddenly made less and less sense, rendering that future newly and profoundly confusing, and the bearing Western society would be taking there less and less coherent. Many of us are left now in that profound confusion, completely bewildered by anyone and everyone else’s personal utopia. 

Myself and my peers’ development as human beings coincided with the development of this metamorphosis in such a way that suggested humor at the spectacle of it all might be the safest way to cope. For myself, I should report, now, at 27 years old – having witnessed the most significant expansion of our species’ intellectual capabilities (and corresponding divisions) in its history just since 8th grade – that the humor has run entirely out. Determining what remains has been my own prime interpersonal struggle as of late, but I can at least tell you for certain that whatever it is exists in a more absolute state of inevitability than I could have ever imagined possible as I watched some AT&T employee crumple the clear plastic wrapping away from that most extraordinary matte black rectangular box containing my very first iPhone.[^1]

![Original iPhone Activation](https://i.snap.as/nqhmSK4U.png)

It was an 8GB first-generation. I named­ it “Bob Geldoff” because I had absolutely no idea who that was,[^2] which I found hilarious.­ In the (admittedly unsolicited) self-psychoanalysis I’ve ended up in, these past few months, I would suggest that handset remains the single most powerful symbol of an era in my life when the future of technology felt absolutely enamoring. We were going to get to try everything just because we could, *and it was going to make everything better*. I watched and read the forming of the *Gadget Blogger* generation – Joshua Topolsky, then Joanna Stern, Paul Miller, Nilay Patel, Dieter Bohn, and others, all led by their seniors Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher – who would eventually form the establishment technology media as it stands right now. On early tech YouTube, my friend and I worshipped SoldierKnowsBest, iJustine, and Jon4Lakers from our MacBooks – Mark Watson, Justine Ezarik, and Jon Rettinger, respectively – who managed to convey with their embedded iSight cameras the sort of Consumer Tech Hype which can become addicting, especially to those young minds searching for a simple framework from which to understand existence and time.

Big words for a cellular telephone review, eh? I realize I’ve already lost many of you, but I do not despair, for 

"This *really is* my last iPhone."

This is the last sentence of [my very sentimental iPhone 8 Plus review](https://bilge.world/iphone-8-plus-review) from May, 2018, in which I bemoaned Apple's decision to finally retire the basic hardware configuration which had defined the marque's first ten years, citing my "loyalty." 

In the past half year, I have come to realize that the device which I now hold in my hands - which I *cling to*, in fact, at all hours and completely without reason - is the absolute manifestation of everything my 14-year-old, first generation iPhone-adopting self could have possibly dreamt of in its future. Unlike that iPhone 8 Plus review - which was a very sentimental reflection on "the last iPhone" designed in the configuration I had understood for a decade and therefore accompanied by a bunch of foolhardy lamentations *bitching* about the iPhone X - this review will be one of sincere wonderment regarding *the thing, itself*, first, before taking flight into a wider critique of our current consumer technology ethos.

Taken out of 2021 context and placed in my 14-year-old hand in 2009, this Pacific Blue iPhone 12 Pro Max would not have disappointed me in the slightest. By that, I mean... It is as unimaginably capable as I would have imagined. It eclipsed any compromising capability distinctions from desktop computers long ago, cast its tethers to the Old Ways off, and ascended into what I would have regarded as a true p o w e r   o b j e c t. On this *cellular telephone*, I have run complex commands in a full Linux shell, captured massive 4K/60fps video files of myself falling over, played console-class video games and *streamed them live in HD* simultaneously, archived entire web domains locally, and on and on… In fact, this iPhone has done the majority of these [*measurably*](https://browser.geekbench.com/user/238089) better than any desktop computer I have ever owned.

![The Original](https://i.snap.as/Ep06W6A9.jpg)

All of these capabilities contained within a form factor that has been *smushed*, you might say, in comparison to that First Generation device[^3]. It has slimmed by nearly half a centimeter (4.2mm,) widened by 17.1mm, and lengthened by 45.8mm, though it’s also gained almost 60% in mass - from 135 to 228 g - which I personally found the most surprising statistic. In fact, it invalidates literally years of my suppositions that increases in newer iPhones’ apparent resistance to drop trauma over time was certainly because they were getting lighter,[^4] but no… *Heft* is luxury… *Excess* is a point of pride… *Sensation* has become the upmost ideal of hardware interface design.

These past months, I have indulged myself thoroughly in the company of this long-dormant *Handset Enthusiast* part of me - this dork who seems to be infinitely enchanted by conversations vaguely about innovation in a business which seemed almost inevitably alienating of anyone who didn't care enough about some unexotic discussion in the tech community to a demonstrably obsessive degree. Again, the experience has screamed over and over again that I am extremely vulnerable to high computing capability. In other words, the more a computer can do, the more I want to see what I can do *with* it. For a very long time, iPhone OS' locked downness actually helped me tremendously in this regard.

about the tools we use to make things: how we learned to make them, how we learned to learn to use them, and how we learned to teach others - identifying it *truly* and meditating 

![iPhone 12 Pro Max Physical Controls Diagram](https://i.snap.as/aln4F1N2.png)

It is a guarantee that no matter where I may go or who I may find myself unwittingly surrounded by, the option to escape into my own Computing World *in its entirety* and more - not just an abbreviated, **Mobile** facsimile - shall from now on and forever be with me, there against my right asscheek, just a grab and a glance away. Like The Holy Spirit was it pledged and prepared to stay by my side.

down to a depth of six feetYa know, I'm actually astonished by how much of this ritual *hasn't* changed.

Hey guys, this is definitely a *sensitive subject* for me, you might say (lol,) so - before I reply - I want to **ask for your validation right quick.** 

If you can/are willing/would like to read both my question and the â€œFramework Engineerâ€â€™s answer in their entirety and share your thoughts on whether or not it was answered/anything elseâ€¦
Iâ€™d very much appreciate it.


[20-38-2021 08:38 AM] lightningxcookie#0469
The answer you got seems like a non-answer. To me it feels like a typical Apple PR comment where what they really mean is *â€œno commentâ€* or *â€œwhat youâ€™re looking for doesnâ€™t existâ€*. I assume the latter is true in this case, which is unfortunate.

thanks for reading it! alrightâ€¦ thanks you to you, I have achieved **Validated Status** and am ready to begin Tearing Framework Engineer an Entirely New Digestive System.

I donâ€™t see whatâ€™s wrong with the answer they gave. They said you donâ€™t need unique iPhone considerations, what exactly do you want/expect them to do?


[20-43-2021 11:43 AM] koshakji#0791
If thereâ€™s no more documentation than the things they shared, thereâ€™s no more documentation. I donâ€™t see what they did wrong


[20-44-2021 11:44 AM] David Blue#1917
itâ€™s not about doing things right or wrongâ€¦ I was joking about the beef lol. nobody owes *me* anythingâ€¦ Iâ€™d just like to figure out how I can get them to see itâ€™d be to *their* advantage to check again.


[20-44-2021 11:44 AM] David Blue#1917
on this, specifically, they need to uhâ€¦ check again. there are definite differences in support between the two devices.


[20-50-2021 11:50 AM] David Blue#1917
I would also just like to not have to write all the keyboard shortcuts tables myself, ya know? Iâ€™ve been doing it for years but thereâ€™s only so much I can do with just blind testing. I keep discovering new shortcuts that would have been really nice to know about uhâ€¦ 10 years ago.

I donâ€™t want to do anything but bring the issue to light, right? im not trying to *receive* somethingâ€¦ Iâ€™m trying to encourage this person to wonder why there arenâ€™t any docsâ€¦ maybe ask their boss.

now if the answer to that question is *I donâ€™t care*â€¦ **that** would be problematic.

![Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/sHTDx8AV.png)

Indeed, [**it is here**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974). Essentially, Mastodon Commander-in-Chief Eugen Rochko and his team developed a whole, exceptional iOS app in the span of time it took me to write the [third-party Mastodon iOS app showcase](https://bilge.world/mastodon-ios-apps) just before this item in *The Psalms*’ feed. If you’re new to this conversation, perhaps it’d be best to start in February of this year, with [Eugen’s announcement of the “official” Mastodon app’s development](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/) on the official Mastodon blog. “We need an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform,” argues Eugen, in response to feedback indicating “the lack of an app that carries [Mastodon’s] name in the app stores trips up newcomers.” My first thought regarding the idea of an app *Specialized* in onboarding cynically jumped to the assumption that such a design choice would result in a less-than-ideal experience for those of us who already call Mastodon our home. However, as a [Patreon](https://patreon.com/mastodon) supporter of the Mastodon Project, I’ve had the privilege of testing the final result for the past five weeks, and I can tell ya… It is so much more than that.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=bD8GQvNrE7E

## Onboarding

I’d like to offer the [demo video](https://youtu.be/bD8GQvNrE7E) embedded above as an unusually succinct (from me) demonstration of the delightfully well-considered onboarding process. I would go so far as to declare it **the best all-around social network onboarding process currently available**. Having very recently slugged through the official Twitter app’s equivalent, the frames greeting new Mastodon users within this app are unbelievably exceptional. 

![Onboarding in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/P5oxTAg9.png)

First, we’re presented with a list of Mastodon instances (servers,) organized by category. Those friends of mine to whom I’ve failed to “sell” Mastodon have cited server selection as a major obstacle of confusion and I can’t imagine a better means of addressing it than the tool offered by this app. It’s beautiful and fast in a way previous utilities - like [instances.social](https://instances.social) - cannot be, especially for those most lacking in attention. Once we’ve chosen a server, we are immediately presented up front with a clearly readable document containing the “ground rules” set by its administrators. In my experience, these rules tend to be notably **easy-to-understand** and **not open to interpretation**, as if they were written primarily in the interest of community wellness rather than to construct a defense from legal action. 

After we’ve agreed to the relevant terms of the server we’ve chosen, it’s on to account creation, which offers the options to which citizens of the social web have become accustomed - profile picture, username, email address, and password - but notably without the [inexplicable errors](https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/n8hxzr7/176-twicarus) exhibited for years in Big Social’s equivalent functions. Immediately following this frame, we are prompted to check our inboxes for a confirmation link. The explanation for my dramatic exclamation in the demo video comes down to Mastodon for iOS’ implementation of the operating system's intra-app linking function (with the syntax `mastodon://`,) which (in my experience) is hardly ever utilized correctly. The result is that I was able to click the incoming confirmation link within Outlook for iOS and then proceed *within the Mastodon app* instead of being bounced off to a web browser. This integration should not be remarkable, but - in the context of iOS development as it stands in 2021 - it most certainly is.

After confirmation, we are offered the option to explore the app’s “Find people to follow” function, which is informed by "a mix of most followed accounts and most-engaged-with accounts from recent times that post primarily in your language," as [Eugen explained](https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/106674282886448440) in response to an earlier draft of this post. Indeed, the remarkably relevant results offered to me in the demo were not actually remarkable at all: I just know a lot of folks on mastodon.online - especially those who post the most. That's the whole bit! If you need "proof," [here is the finished result](https://mastodon.online/@keys), but obviously, I would advise you download the app and try yourself. (It's a cliché, yes, but seriously... What do you have to lose?)

![Trending & Profile Editing in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/F21Jm29Q.png)

## Advantages

One of the distinctly missing functions among the breadth of third-party offerings has been the ability to edit one's profile information from within the app. Mastodon for iOS addresses this in a particularly visually impressive way (see image embedded above.) Some also have yet to be updated with support for Polls, which the new app encompasses in a manner that puts Big Social's equivalents to shame. The ability to vertically drag individual options in the compose interface, for instance, reflects insight only gained by *actually using these features*. The result is definitively the best means of crafting a Mastodon poll, for what that's worth.

![Polling in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/NKHk8e1W.png)

### Shortcuts

As of this writing, Mastodon for  iOS also includes Siri Shortcut support by way of a single action, entitled "Post on Mastodon." Mostly in the interest of demonstration, I have created and published two Shortcuts around this action on RoutineHub: 

1. "[**Mastodon Share**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9776/)" - a text-only Shortcut meant for the Share Sheet.
2. "[**Mastgur**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9781/)" - a more complicated Shortcut utilizing Imgur actions to get around the current Mastodon for iOS action's lack of multimedia support.

![Siri Shortcuts for Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/H212I22P.png)

Mastodon friend Emma's [customization of the latter](https://mstdn.cloud.themaymeow.com/@emma/106656610574981709) is a great example of how quickly one can tailor these (and all other) Siri Shortcuts to their own particular use.

## Challenges

As of this writing, coverage of the app’s release amounted only to [a single news item from *The Verge*’s Adi Robinson](https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602275/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-official-ios-app-launches), which notes the omission of local/federated “firehose” timeline views out of a desire to “reduce the potential for conflict with Apple.” (see: the Inc.’s [blatantly inconsistent enforcement](https://litchie.com/2021/07/idos2-will-be-gone) of its store policies in the past few months.) As a Mastodon user who *does* occasionally engage with my local and federated timelines, I find this decision reasonable considering the wellspring of third-party apps on iOS which *do* support said views and the app’s explicit focus on brand new, fragile users. My personal experience disagrees with Eugen’s description of these timelines as a suboptimal means of capital-D Discovery, however, considering I’ve found ~70-80% of [the 600+ accounts I follow](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv), there. (Though it should be noted that I *do not* represent any majority in my social media-specific preferences or behavior.)

Though the onboarding process’ people to follow finder is pretty darn stellar, I worry that our hypothetical new user has a high chance of landing on a more-or-less empty timeline. (For many, I’m sure this would be a welcome relief, at least initially.) A well-limited Local timeline view, at least, might prove a valuable upcoming addition. Regardless, I am 100% positive these omissions from the *initial release* version of this iOS app do not constitute some new ideological opposition to the greater concept of Federation. 

![Composition Details in Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/7UTf6Qyx.png)

Naturally, a recurring complaint about the app is already surfacing in hashtag iOS on the Fediverse: [no multiple account support](https://mastodon.social/@wiredfire/106672087623244223)?! Perhaps you’ve already written me off as a mindless devotee, but - especially after exploring [the whole breadth of Mastodon apps available on iOS](https://github.com/extratone/FediiOS) (all of which support multiple accounts) - the significance of this omission as a target for gripes seems laughably minuscule. Considering I have yet to delete any of the 20 apps I tested, I personally feel *pretty well covered* when it comes to checking my (embarrassingly numerous) alt accounts. It’d be one thing if longtime users/powerusers were left wanting for available apps designed for us, but we have a more diverse, quality palette to choose from than any other social media protocol. To decry this app - which was explicitly designed from the very beginning for new users - for skipping a function offered by *more than a dozen alternatives* is patently absurd. If you’ve got multiple accounts you feel the need to check regularly, order them by frequency, authenticate all but number one in the free, dependable [Amaroq](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amaroq-for-mastodon/id1214116200), and save Mastodon’s new app for your main.

## Delights

The “relentless originality” I spoke of in my *third-party* showcase is no less exemplified in this first-party Mastodon app. Its color palette is a welcome departure from Tootsuite’s (the mother web application,) while still remaining definitively recognizable. The artwork dispersed throughout the app is adorable, as you’ve seen, and its bespoke audio player is without a doubt my favorite of such devices.

![Mastodon for iOS Audio Player](https://i.snap.as/IRzEOzXl.png)

Custom audio notifications especially stood out among those third-party apps, so the project-sourced app’s inclusion of the iconic Mastodon “boop” is yet another small inclusion that adds a surprising amount of substance to the whole experience.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/MastodonBoop.mp3">
</audio>

Though quite specific to myself and the few other iPhone users who regularly command our handsets with physical keyboards, the Mastodon app’s inclusion of **Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts** provoked a moment of true euphoria when I first discovered them. As per my ‘[*iPhone and the Bluetooth Keyboard*](https://github.com/extrakeys) project, I have bestowed upon Mastodon for iPhone semi-officially “our” Universal Clacker Award for its consideration of us “full keyboard-strapped cellular phone users.” (As of this writing, the award is just a “trophy.”)

![Mastodon for iPhone - Universal Clacker Award](https://i.snap.as/H7NjCvd7.png)

### Mastodon for iOS Keyboard Shortcuts
| Action                         | Key        |
|:------------------------------:|:----------:|
| Open Compose Window            | ⌘ + N      |
| Send Toot                      | ⌘ + Return |
| Home Timeline/Refresh Timeline | ⌘ + 1      |
| Explore Tab                    | ⌘ + 2      |
| Notifications                  | ⌘ + 3      |
| Favorites                      | ⌘ + F      |
| Settings                       | ⌘ + ,      |
| Next Toot                      | j          |
| Previous Toot                  | k          |
| Toot Details                   | l          |
| Favorite                       | f          |
| Boost                          | r          |

An important consideration to inform the perspective through which we analyze such an app, I’d argue, is that **this app could have been very bad**. Those who bewilderingly measure the success of social networking services/protocols by their profit growth viability, alone, may well suggest it *should* have been bad. Had it been just mediocre, half-assed, and/or full of bugs, I’m sure I would still have paused everything to write and publish this review. The reality, though, is nothing less than exceptional. Unlike some of the third-party examples I discussed, I would argue Mastodon for iPhone to be an “objectively” excellent piece of software in that I cannot imagine any one sort of iPhone user *not* finding it refreshing in some way. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I just realized something…<br><br>in developing its own iOS app, Mastodon has achieved something Twitter never has.<br><br>Twitter bought Tweetie and rebranded it. they never bothered with building their own app. <a href="https://t.co/NRPf1bkbKc">https://t.co/NRPf1bkbKc</a></p>&mdash; ※ David Blue ※ (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1421466191781052423?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

I would sincerely worry for the person who feels nothing at all from the artwork, the bespoke UI, or the general care exhibited in its craftsmanship, *but* they wouldn’t have exhausted reasons to use it. From the very first beta release I installed to the first release version pushed to the App Store just yesterday, the app has *never* crashed, and the single bug I encountered was documented and fixed before I had time to begin a feedback report. While Twitter’s official iOS app does include a few Siri Shortcuts actions, they are all made immediately useless by a universal command to open the app, itself. Remove the obsessive insistence that any/all functions only be performed with your app in focus - even when it surely makes no difference to your ad tech mechanism - and you have Mastodon’s single action, “Show When Run” toggle included.

I’m not sure what I expected from an “official” Mastodon app upon first reading that winter blog post, but what I’ve been delivered is quite a gem. Regardless of how its specific feature omissions may strike your ideological organ(s,) you cannot deny that great time and energy was invested in this app.

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,

With conquering limbs astride from land to land;

Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand

A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame

Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name

Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand

Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command

The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.

“Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she

With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”

![Harvest Theme - Tweetbot 6.3](https://i.snap.as/3Q0YFS3h.png)

Several weeks ago, after finally taking the taking the time to explore the modernizations shipped with TweetBot 6.2 [in mid-August](https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/17/tweetbot-6-2-update-timeline-widgets-multiple-windows-support-ipad), it occurred to me that it might be an ideal time to follow up on a brief exchange I’d had with Tapbots support in mid-February concerning a single, single key Bluetooth keyboard shortcut, ultimately - using the F key to favorite (and now `Shift + ⌘ + L` to “like”) which then seemed to have been lost in the transition from Tweetbot 5 to Tweetbot 6. If you’ll recall from [my first stupidly time-consuming big Post of 2021](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review), our conversation was left open ended with “thanks, we’ll take a look at these.” You might also recall a very specific pledge of mine which I just rediscovered:

> Without being verbose, I’ll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the `F` and `⌘ + R` shortcuts, I 𝒲ℐℒℒ shit out my whole ass.

The amount I’d learned about iPhone History and its operating system’s coinciding development in the since this exchange felt absolutely ginormous… So frighteningly great was it to behold, that I actually included a lame suggestion in my reply, that it might have *something* to do with Objective C vs. SwiftUI (god y’all are so cliquey though,) in what I also decided would be the last time I bothered them about it. 

![Second Email to Tapbots](https://i.snap.as/SRNCTVev.png)

Naturally… They were 100% correct… I just somehow managed to skip the crucial step of actually *trying the shortcuts in the app* before reaching out. Very likely the least competent behavior possible from *The iPhone Hardware Keyboard Guy*, yeah? 

https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1427679138572390400

Anyway, though their spare release notes don’t mention it, the Tapbots guys obviously hooked a keyboard up to an iPhone recently. I’m actually not quite sure how many of these I missed before, but using the `R` key to Retweet, `Q` to Quote Tweet, and `L` to like have all been re-implemented. (You’ll need to confirm Retweets with the `Return` key.)

Eighty days ago, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering ~~stood up in front of a crowd of~~... 

No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother’s basement, on a Monday morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of the Apple community’s unbelievably unreserved, almost *spiritual* volume of **pure hype** from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage. (Hilariously, *all* of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in 2015 and [kept comparing to Slack](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison), but like an actual madman.)

Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:

> For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...

I’m dwelling on them because they are **patently meaningless**. Very little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call *ease-of-use-centric*. Some of it - namely controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari - feels almost maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of [**the full feature list**](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/) are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

![The Foundation Image](https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png)

This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone’s billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig *should* be referring to with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or “end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a *utilitarian* device, above all else. They don’t have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn them off. Realistically, they don’t even have time to read this whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.) 

Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users’ devices over the Find My network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple Maps’ live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.

![Testing Home Screens for iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/eBBnwCIn.png)

What I *will* dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple’s automation knows better than us users when something should happen or change. A great example: using [a simple Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c) to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead of trusting the [unnecessarily complex conditions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086) of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons. 

Quite simply, the more automated iOS has become, the less comfortably in control I have felt. For myself, at least, every single functional automation Apple has introduced has drastically failed to simplify my own using life, and the vast majority have in fact complicated it dramatically. Apple-adjacent publications and greater tech media have ceased all-out criticism and instead resorted to justifying and explaining (or attempting to, anyway) just about all of Apple’s subtle retractions of user control over the years, but apparently, I am too much of a control freak to let it go. I have been here since the very beginning, have bitched loudly all along, and do not plan to go quietly into that automated night. This theme pervades throughout this review, so for any of you who *do* feel like iOS’ automations fit comfortably into your life, please keep this in mind. 

![Safari Settings in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/oHqejXq1.png)

## The Gist

Rounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode immediately after installing iOS 15, you’ll notice that Notifications and other elements have had their rounded corners *further* rounded, for some reason. Assuming Safari ships with its new look turned on by default, the screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to change) where one can switch it off. (Your best bet is to visit [**its menu in Settings**](prefs:root=SAFARI) as displayed on the right in `Settings ⇨ Safari`.) As of this writing, at least two of iOS 15’s “headlining” features have been pushed to further iterative updates: [SharePlay](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/ios-15-apple-shareplay-tv-delay-b1904548.html) and [iCloud Private Relay](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/). I suspect you will be prompted to explore Focus Modes upon initial installation, which I will eventually analyze in relative detail. Ideally, you’ll also be prompted to explore “Shared With You,” which I personally believe to be the release’s most significant addition for most people, by far. 

As far as "meaningful ways iPhone could help you," I see little more than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not so complex to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this moment) a pretty hopeless implementation of a theoretically useful concept. Some additional filters in Apple Maps search will prove useful so long as the associated metadata has been updated for locations *other* than San Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.) Optical Character (text) Recognition has been implemented “system wide” under the feature Apple terms “Live Text,” and translation has finally been extended to the places where it’s most useful (think: Safari.) 

In general, though, most of what’s coming with iOS 15 has little real value in the day-to-day experience for most iPhone users. A complete inversion of Craig’s phrase feels significantly more accurate: *This year, we were inspired to create even more superficial ways iPhone could temporarily dazzle tech media*. 

And now, I’d like to take you through what I feel are the considerations I’d like my family to know - namely my 70-year-old mother, who depends 100% on her iPhone and MacBook Pro every day to run her private practice - but also my ~8 nieces and nephews spanning 6th grade-graduate school, who all - if I’m not mistaken - have iPhones.

```markdown
Worthy of note: this “review” is very heavily focused on *iOS* - which is to say *iPhone* - to the point where any overlap with iPadOS/MacOS/WatchOS/HomeOS/any other goddamned operating system is purely coincidental. For coverage of those changes, please seek your regular sources.
```

![Shared With You - Photos App in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/5otqrdNU.png)

## Photos

### Shared With You

The single most important/welcome feature addition to iOS 15 for most people, I believe, is found in Apple’s native Photos app and entitled **Shared With You**. This view - found in the second tab in the bottom navigation row (“For You”) - is a reverse-chronological timeline of every bit of media (photos & videos) you’ve ever been sent over iMessage. For those with a lot of iOS-using friends (unlike myself,) I would imagine the list will take quite a while to populate. 

### Memories

I find Alex Guyot’s bit on changes to Memories (from [his iOS 15 overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/)) much more concise than what I’d written, so here it is almost in full:

> Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple Music, and can be customized with color filters. Setting different filters will result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on Memories videos.  

> While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn’t transition away. The song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically altered to match back up with the song’s beat.  

> If you don’t want to go with the song that was chosen automatically, you can tap the new Music button to get a pop-up interface into Apple Music, allowing you to choose a song manually. This interface will include smart suggestions for other songs that Apple thinksd you’ll like which would also fit the vibe of your video.  

https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg

Yeah. I hope you’re at least half as amused as I have continued to be by algorithmic video generation. [The above result](https://youtu.be/7uFR_bSxhTg) was created with absolutely zero modification from an album of images and videos which Photos automatically created via face recognition. The only other coherent option from my own limited set of photos is really the only one that matters, I think you'll agree. "Pet Friends" yielded [inevitably uplifting results](https://youtu.be/-1bA7-oslkc) in all three of my test renders, but - given a crop of cute dog photos - little intelligence is necessary to produce.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1bA7-oslkc

If you're experiencing any sort of Déjà vu from the idea of auto-generated slideshows with rights-free soundtracks in the Photos app, it's because Apple has made several distinct attempts to implement very similar iterations of the feature throughout iPhone's history, which has involved iMovie on iOS and MacOS once or twice. I have fiddled with every one - including iOS 15's - and my (truly sound and original) advice is to **avoid spending time trying to customize auto-generated videos** in general. If you explore one of the suggested Memories and find the software's default result satisfactory, of course you should save it, but be wary of any attempts to take editorial control yourself.

![Visual Lookup Indicator in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/74HOlnLP.png)

### Visual Lookup

Perhaps the most unjustifiable background use of your phone’s resources introduced in iOS 15, “Visual Lookup,” seeks to identify “popular art and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers out in nature, books, and breeds of pets” present in your photos so that you might… identify them more swiftly(?) The only means of distinguishing photos on which Visual Lookup has been applied is to look for the modified ⓘ symbol at the very bottom of your screen in the photo browsing view (see the screenshot embedded above.) As you might notice in the screenshots *below*, not one of its analyses on my own images was usably accurate. 

The decision to target the feature on identifying domesticated pets, specifically, is more universalizing than historic landmarks, for sure, but it also immediately sets up the technology (at least this preview of it) for failure.  

![Visual Lookup in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/AtxzN45h.png)

### Metadata

Hooray! You can now view an image's basic details in the "Info pane," by swiping up on an image or using the ⓘ button. This includes the extension (type) and size of the image file, camera identification and configuration details, and -  as part of Shared With You - from whom/where you got the image. Bizarrely, the "Adjust" tool also lets you alter a given image's timestamp and location information. While I can imagine infinitely many reasons why you'd want to *omit* or *delete* such information, I cannot conceive of a single wholesome reason why one would chose to *change* it, instead. 

![Photo Stacks in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/93BGmX4I.png)

### Messages

Just a few weeks shy of [iMessage's tenth birthday](https://web.archive.org/web/20120308031950/https://www.apple.com/ios/features.html), Apple has finally added a button to save incoming photos directly in Messages conversations. It's about as blatant as Apple interface design gets - you'll spot it opposite others' images. Tapping it saves the appropriate photo(s) directly to the Recents folder before a silly animation vanishes the button itself.

Once again, from Mr. Guyot:

> Groups of photos that you send will now be shown as stacks instead of in a long list, allowing you to more easily swipe through the images without losing track of the conversation around them. Tap on a stack to open a grid view where you can see and select multiple photos at once.  

I took the screenshot embedded above in iOS 15 Developer Beta 5, and… Do “stacks” not look hilariously janky as fuck? 

![Live Text in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/DNJOKq85.png)

### Live Text

For someone like myself, iOS 15’s system-wide integration of Optical Character Recognition is undoubtedly its most useful addition by far. Throughout the Developer Beta, it’s moved up this list gradually as I’ve come to see how it could be useful for *you*, as well. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3kj0-q4k9k

The [video embedded above](https://youtu.be/y3kj0-q4k9k) is a very rough demo, but I suspect it’s more “authentic” than most you’d see elsewhere. The ability to *accurately* capture text right from the camera is invaluable, but for most folks, *line breaks* are going to be a real problem. I’m working on a way to address this with a Siri Shortcut, which I’ll obviously share here when/if I succeed. 

## Audio

https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhxtfW0taIY

### Background Sounds

My eldest sister has used a sound/noise machine to sleep for as long as I can remember, so I was especially excited to show her iOS 15’s native “Background Sounds” feature, but she was distinctly unimpressed, noting that her iPhone-based sound generation needs were well met by third-party apps she’d already discovered.[^1] I didn’t have time to try out her recommendations, but I’m going to assume they aren’t able to operate “behind” *additional* audio playback like the “new” native feature is.

![Background Sounds Interrupt Remedy](https://i.snap.as/SGQt93K4.png)

My personal (hopefully insightful) anecdote: Background Sounds appear to be impervious from the audio interruption issues iOS has struggled with since its origin, which makes them a partial remedy to the discomfort of sudden, unexpected silence when using headphones with active noise cancellation. As configured in the screenshot embedded above (the menu found in `Settings ⇨ Accessibility ⇨ Audio/Visual ⇨ Background Sounds`) - with “Use When Media Is Playing” toggled `OFF`- your selected Background Sound *should* fade in when normal playback from another app is interrupted.[^2] 

### “Spatial Audio”

Just to be clear, I strongly believe that normal users should basically ignore all mention of Apple’s “Spatial Audio” (read: don’t worry about it) for a few reasons, most of which aren’t all that interesting. Since [one of my very first written works on tech](https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback) was/is directly related to the subject, though, indulge me for just a moment for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note that only two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms you’ve certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are) are necessary for audio to become “spatial.” If you’re curious about this, [my favorite all-time web experience from *The Pudding*](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/) is an absolutely impeccable next destination. Secondly, the actual technology behind Apple’s title was not developed by Apple, but by Dolby. It’s not that Apple doesn’t acknowledge this thoroughly in [their explainer docs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182), nor is Dolby by any means a wee organization in need of my amplification, but this is one of those Apple habits that’s become a particular peev. If you’re interested, [here is the actual spec sheet for Dolby Atmos in PDF](https://professional.dolby.com/siteassets/cinema-products---documents/dolby-atmos-specifications.pdf).

![Control Center Decibel Meter](https://i.snap.as/1vGTW0Iz.png)

If you happen to have either AirPods Pro or AirPods Max devices, an iPhone 7 or later, *and* an Apple Music subscription, you might want to disregard my cynicism at least long enough to try "[dynamic head tracking](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182)."

### SharePlay

*The Verge*’s Chaim Gartenburg did [an excellent - if a bit precocious - job of explaining](https://www.theverge.com/22577178/shareplay-how-to-apple-facetime-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-apple-tv-video-music) what he describes as iOS 15’s “headline feature,” called SharePlay:

> It’s a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends and family while video chatting.  

In my opinion, SharePlay represents one of those great, well-thought solutions to some notably youth-specific challenges which nobody (even the youth) will see as more worthwhile than their own. By that I mean, one ear bud per person… now, an ancient tradition. I’ve deprioritized it, in contrast to Chaim, because I’d bet it’s also one of those things one can only learn themselves.

![Notifications in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/TFWvW1b6.png)

## Notifications, Focus, and Attention

Yes, notifications have gotten *even rounder still* for some reason in iOS 15. Contact photos and “larger app icons” also “make them easier to identify,” according to Apple. (This is the one point in my whole writing life where the phrase *well I’ll be the judge of that!* is 100% valid and applicable.) There’s also a new feature called **Notification Summary** which is an absolutely useless and unnecessary complication, at least at the moment. Honestly, the one bit of solid advice from [*The Social Dilemma*](https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma) was… Just turn all Notifications off, or at least as many as possible. Notifications Summary feels like a near direct response to that one goddamned film, and its new Focus Modes do even more so.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=YZCx-9wF3ow

### Focus(es)

The most glaringly standout parallel between Microsoft’s Windows 11 release (which I have also been beta testing much less dutifully for most of this year) and Apple’s stated goals in iOS 15’s design centers around the design supposition that maximum malleability of the “spaces” in which one dwells on their operating system - namely, the “desktop(s)” and/or “home screen(s)” - lends toward a more healthy digital occupancy of them, especially in terms of attention. Unfortunately, both of them chose respective solutions which - from my view, anyway - **add complexity** more than anything.

[*The Verge*’s guide](https://www.theverge.com/22665196/ios-15-focus-modes-custom-icons-widgets-how-to) frames Focus as a customization feature to be used in tandem with [custom app icons](https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change) to fiddle your way into your own *bespoke iPhone experience*. I could be wrong, but I suspect very few among my family will find the time investment required worth the end result, but we’ll see.

![Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/mxwVtN7p.png)

I chose to embed [Matt Birchler’s guide to Focus](https://youtu.be/YZCx-9wF3ow) above because it’s by far the most succinct and helpful video I’ve yet seen on iOS 15, generally, and demonstrates how a working person might actually use Focus. My one addendum to this (and any other Focus) guide: **proceed *without* the automated bits** by avoiding anything under the `TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY` subsection of the menu. For whatever reason, location-based automation triggers on iPhone, especially, have literally **never** functioned usefully (or *reliably*) in my experience. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40y7iLdfOnM

## Maps & CarPlay

(I *am* going to do a bit of editorializing on this subject, specifically.) If the video embedded above is confusing, know that it's a very insular joke - over six years ago, in [my video review of the Nissan Juke NISMO](https://bit.ly/JukeHonk), I praised its integrated navigation screen specifically for its frugality. 

> I'm not old. I don't need a gigantic nav screen. I don't need to see a 3D rendition of the whole Earth and my position relative to it.

...and yet, a playful, exploratory experience is what Apple has in mind for Maps, apparently. Here's their description of the new "Interactive globe" feature:

> Discover the natural beauty of Earth with a rich and interactive 3D globe, including significantly enhanced details for mountain ranges, deserts, forests, oceans, and more.

In the footnotes, it’s explained that the feature will only be available on "iPhone with A12 Bionic or later," meaning the iPhone X range, basically, which makes sense considering the extent of animation and touch manipulation technology present in this view. It’s an entertaining plaything, but not much more, which is strange and frustrating. If I could gather the usage statistics across all my family’s iPhones, how much time would you suppose they’ve spent in Apple Maps to date *screwing around* as opposed to *searching and navigating*? 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1437519482428272641

Put another way - Apple’s developmental direction for Apple Maps as a service seems distinctly toward a travel/entertainment application (notably, like [Google Earth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097),) instead of a utilitarian navigation app (like [Google Maps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354), [Waze](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106), or [MapQuest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapquest-gps-navigation-maps/id316126557).) It’s not just the Interactive globe. One of the most exciting features in last year’s release (iOS 14) was the ability for Maps users to create custom Guides. I created [my own](https://bit.ly/columbiaguide) containing a few local spots I believe to be especially relevant for first-time travelers/new residents of *my* area. Clearly, I misinterpreted the intended function of Guides entirely - continuing without a means of discovering *user-generated* guides, whatsoever, iOS 15 cements (in my view) that they’ll instead continue to be left to travel magazines, none of which I recognize save for *Atlas Obscura*, who’s “[Hidden Wonders of Chicago](https://guides.apple.com/?lsp=9902&pg=15126682529740253227)” guide appears to be the single worthwhile representation of the Midwest on the service.

![Apple Maps User Account in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/TxDuz5nb.png)

One welcome exception to this absence of investment in user-generated content is the new, unified “user account” view, which aggregates one’s curation (both private and public) along with travel preferences and a list of one’s **contributions** to Apple Maps - another new feature for the app. 

![Place Cards - Apple Maps in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/LX5HW4T3.png)

Above is a screenshot of my first test contribution to Apple Maps (my [mom’s private practice](http://bit.ly/elonglcswam),) which also serves as an example of Maps’ new “place cards.” As of this writing, all of my test contributions are still held "Pending Review," yet navigating to [the share link](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1714%20Oak%20Cliff%20Pl,%20Columbia,%20MO%20%2065203,%20United%20States&auid=6487223830929868055&ll=38.933965,-92.387854&lsp=9902&q=Eileen%20Long,%20MSW%20LCSW&_ext=CjIKBQgEEOIBCgQIBRADCgQIBhByCgQIChAACgQIUhAECgQIVRAACgQIWRAGCgUIpAEQARImKZSjW/v4dkNAMW0PujQxGVfAORJ5gVcfeENAQd9/R/9zGFfAUAM%3D&t=m) with a desktop browser indicates they've already been made public.

![3D Hy-Vee](https://i.snap.as/SILn5LmG.png)

### CarPlay

As of this writing, it’s unclear how much of the Maps features I’ve used will be carried over to CarPlay upon iOS 15.0.0’s official release, but I know for *certain* that CarPlay is a weekly (if not daily) used feature by virtually all of my family members. With the additional variable of [differences in support between given automobile marques/models](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/) - including which support [Car Key](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211234) - it’s difficult to say definitively what will have changed about your personal CarPlay use. What experience I do have using CarPlay has been exclusively with my mom’s [2019 Volkswagen Jetta](https://youtu.be/hqQqfdHsGx0,) and documented visually in [this photo gallery](https://snap.as/extratone/ios15) as well as [on my alt Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dieselgoth/channel)’s “iOS & iPhone” IGTV Series.

![Apple Maps Night Navigation](https://i.snap.as/iQD53oId.png)

To once again cite from [the official full features list](https://hyp.is/Cbc_LBUmEey4S4Mcwd1lKA/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/):

> An all-new driving map helps you see traffic, incidents, and other details that affect your drive at a glance. See incredible road details like turn lanes, bike, bus, and taxi lanes, medians, crosswalks, and much more. When approaching a complex interchange, Maps switches to a 3D road-level perspective to help you find your way."

"It's faster and easier to report an issue in Maps" is a standout, literal statement. Once you've navigated to the menu in the screenshot below (via the chatbox with exclamation point icon,) touching any of the three options will *immediately* report its respective information without confirmation.

![Report an Incident - CarPlay in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/VKfuhJvH.png)

The default **Driving Focus** can be configured to activate automatically as soon as CarPlay connects which *would* be the single exception from my earlier advice against automating Focus modes at all were it not for the mode's lockout from the Lock Screen (as shown in the first of the three screenshots embedded below.)

![Driving Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/m5974FcB.png)

Once you've locked your device with the Driving Focus on, you must clear an extra step to unlock it by selecting "I'm Not Driving," which then turns the Focus off. In my (unsolicited) opinion, this renders the Focus unusable at best and arguably downright dangerous. "Hey Siri!" is an option most folks I know leave off and I can't imagine a single reason to add such an obstruction. 

![Custom Car Focus - iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/xcNfKv6g.png)

I *can* offer a solution, however, in the form of my custom Car Focus, which only allows calls and texts from my mom, open a single, otherwise-hidden custom (work-in-progress) Home Screen with exclusively driving/nav/travel-relevant apps, and even activates automatically via a very simple automation in [the Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752). Technically, the only feature it's missing from the default Driving Focus are automatic text replies, which (as of beta) weren't working anyway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hNCsS4I0uk

For those new to Siri Shortcuts completely, I recorded a [rough video guide](https://youtu.be/-hNCsS4I0uk) on how to set up both the Focus and its automation.

![Reminders in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/0tsmBGe3.png)

### Reminders

“A to-do list is, ultimately, nothing more or less than an attempt to persuade yourself” concludes [a feature by Clive Thompson](https://www.wired.com/story/to-do-apps-failed-productivity-tools) in the most recent issue of *WIRED*. In the face of a literally indigestible volume of available (and *award-winning*!) Task Management applications found on iOS - [Microsoft To Do](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-to-do/id1212616790), [Microsoft Lists](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-lists/id1530637363), [Todoist](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855), [Things 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743), [Fantastical](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190), [GoodTask](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-to-do-list-tasks/id1068039220), [OmniFocus 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-3/id1346190318), and on… - Apple’s Reminders app has always had perhaps the most insurmountable task of all its native applications in remaining competitive. Up until I wrote this review, my personal list in the app was nothing but a wasteland of forgotten, out-of-context items from up to 7 years ago (!) which I’d obviously set with Siri without bothering to correct its voice recognition.

Before you proceed to experiment with Reminders, I’d recommend using my [Reminders Backup Siri Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10118) to create a .zip file of *all* existing items in your Reminders app, even if there are just a few. I insist upon this largely because it’s so fast and so frugal. (Here’s [how to allow the addition of Siri Shortcuts from third-party sources](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/enable-shared-shortcuts-apdfeb05586f/ios).)

For a particularly positive - but very trustworthy - perspective on the additions to Reminders coming in iOS 15, [John Voorhees’ overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/reminders-smart-lists-put-unprecedented-control-in-the-hands-of-users/) is succinct and informative.

An opportunity for an anecdotal, but genuinely exciting! demonstration is allowed us in Reminders: **Drag & Drop** is, indeed, [*finally here*](https://imgur.com/gallery/u8HxROl).

![Safari in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/14Xf21CA.png)

## Safari

```markdown
Before you read on… If you’re just wondering how to make Safari go back to the way it was before, refer back to the first subhead on this page (“The Gist.”)
```

The one commonality in the experience of every single person finishing up their iOS 15 review/overview/guide: we’ve all saved Safari for the very last minute. I am 99% certain the saga surrounding changes to Apple’s native web browser - along with my personal, reactionary gripes spewed along the past two months of iOS 15’s Developer Beta cycle - were the overwhelmingly affirming factors that led to me pursuing this very review. I have rewritten this portion over and over again, but now that you know how to disable the new look, I’m going to as briefly as possible summarize the changes that are actually relevant to you.

* You can now **pull down to refresh**, which apparently the youths *actually* refer to with the acronym “PTR,” these days.
* **Safari Extensions** might be worthwhile. I **absolutely insist** that everyone reading this install one called **Overamped**, which I have been testing. Basically, you’ll never need to think about Google AMP again, which is an absolute gift, I promise.
* **Tab Groups** will almost certainly be nothing but a nuisance for all but the most ridiculous iPhone poweruses like myself.[^3]

If, like me, you’ve always found Bookmark/Favorites management in Safari utterly impossible, you’ll rejoice at the implications of Drag & Drop as demonstrated in the [Twitter video](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438980179712479241) embedded above. 

## Baubles

![OMNIMEMOJI](https://i.snap.as/p8U6kW1g.png)

### Memoji

Finally, the great, terrible Apple God has granted its bizarre animated minimes a torso! I have always found memoji [alarming](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/he03xb), mostly, but now that I’ve paid them mind, I would like to express my sympathy for those of you who enjoy using them. I’m sorry to report that you will still need to go to `Messages` and open the compose window in a conversation in order to select the emoji iMessage app. Though iOS 15 adds full bodies to memoji (and clothes to cover them, as required since Adam & Eve,) as well as “accessible accessories,”[^4] there’s not as yet any way to actually *see* a memoji in full-body view other than the editing interface (as far as I could tell.) You can also choose to separately color your memoji’s eyes. 

![Facetime in The Browser Comedy](https://i.snap.as/vBw0CNhW.png)

### Facetime in The Browser

Yes, you can *technically* Facetime with non-Apple devices thanks to iOS 15's changes. In fact, you'll be able to "Facetime" any device with a web browser! *However*, in doing so you will be forgoing every single one of Facetime's advantages: call quality, "privacy," ecosystem integration, etc. Without these, it would be silly to use Facetime over literally *any* other video calling service. What an immense waste of time, eh?

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430679850399014912

For the sake of thoroughness, though, I should note that I appear to be alone in this view of the new Facetime changes. *MacStories* founder and Ultimate iPad Sage Federico Viticci’s [report on the subject](https://www.macstories.net/stories/facetimes-audio-and-video-take-a-leap-forward-with-apples-upcoming-iphone-ipad-and-mac-os-updates/) was one of mostly satisfaction.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/MicModeTest.flac">
</audio>

I will note, too, that [my test](https://whyp.it/t/testing-the-mic-modes-coming-in-facetime-with-ios-15-54749) of the new “Mic Modes” function yielded impressive results (along with a few other experiences I’ve had so far,) especially in the “Voice Isolation” mode’s performance, but - [as I lamented on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430680198442332160) - its association with FaceTime makes it unavailable where one actually could make use of it on iOS.

## Omissions

I know it probably doesn’t mean much to you, but in my lifetime of beta testing iPhone updates, I have never experienced such a disastrous cycle as 15’s. [*MacWorld*’s outline](https://www.macworld.com/article/353957/ios-15-features-missing-at-launch.html) of the expected features *not* coming in today’s release from the 7th of this month has no less than *eight* headings: *SharePlay*, *Legacy Contacts*, *App Privacy Report*, *3D CarPlay navigation*, *Universal Control*, *IDs in Wallet*, *Custom iCloud email domains*, and *CSAM scanning features*. 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438960700286717955

For us powerusers, Siri Shortcuts are absolutely fucked and Apple Dork Twitter is livid about it. Personally, I find these to be the least problematic of the unfixed bugs, and I can only hope it means that Apple has prioritized fixes for the features most relevant in *your* life. I will be updating this Post as actively as I can in the coming weeks and always appreciate any questions or thoughts you might have about how I could make it more useful.

[1] If you’re reading this and happen to be looking for app recommendations, let me know and I’ll ask her. 
[2] This wasn’t working reliably in the last Developer Beta, but I’ll do my best to check back for the normal release.

## Safari

![Safari in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/14Xf21CA.png)

```markdown
Before you read on… If you’re just wondering how to make Safari go back to the way it was before, refer back to the first subhead on this page (“The Gist.”)
```

The one commonality in the experience of every single person finishing up their iOS 15 review/overview/guide: we’ve all saved Safari for the very last minute. I am 99% certain the saga surrounding changes to Apple’s native web browser - along with my personal, reactionary gripes spewed along the past two months of iOS 15’s Developer Beta cycle - were the overwhelmingly affirming factors that led to me pursuing this very review. 

Though I’ve disagreed with *a lot* of what John Gruber has had to say lately, [his constructively critical post about “Safari 15”](https://daringfireball.net/2021/07/safari_15_public_betas_for_mac_and_ios) from early July became an important foothold of affirmation for my sanity as greater tech media went *alarmingly* quickly from shock to justification and then to celebration (one not-unpopular take I saw literally called Apple’s decisions “brave.”) I found this passage especially resonant:

> One can only presume that Apple’s HI team thinks they’re reducing needless “clutter”, but what they’re doing is systematically removing the coherence between what apps look like and the functionality they offer.

"There always has to be something up our sleeve," said Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview I happened to catch in [a bait re-broadcast YouTube stream](https://youtu.be/ki81PEZ3q2U) while writing this. I find it poignant, indeed, recalling my first experience with the new Safari in Dev Beta 1, this past July. I literally thought I'd opened the wrong app. Specifically, the entirely-redesigned interface I saw reminded me a lot of a (living) ghost of [quaint browser concepts past](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/cake-raises-5-million-for-a-swipeable-mobile-browser/)...The general layout of an experimental app called [Cake](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cake-web-browser/id1163553130).

![Cake Browser vs Safari in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/nJ6h60ql.png)

I won't bore you with any parallels, but I do enjoy the (very fantastic) mental image of Apple Devs huddled around good ole' Cake for inspiration. If you're wondering why I haven't actually named a single one of the *changes* I've been referring to, I thought I might present the entirety of [the Safari section in the full iOS 15 features list](https://hyp.is/c_RW3hWqEeyuMqOqKTovnQ/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/features/) sandwiched between a set of screenshots from iOS 14.8’s Safari and a set of the same locations in the browser as it stands in the iOS 15 Release Candidate.

![Safari 15 Full Changes List](https://i.snap.as/MvR5xRuv.png)

![Safari in iOS 15 RC](https://i.snap.as/dCJNun47.png)

I think the greatest catalyst for the *emotional* component of the controversy lies in the fact that it represents the first complete redesign in the *entire*, 18-year-long history of the software. Since [Safari 1.0 Beta for Mac](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/62233/safari_1_0_beta_mac/) in the Spring of 2003

## What’s New

### Ready for iOS 15 and macOS 12

![r28|641x396](upload://zZlrdpei9BL0aSkbpEA8PGlgeYw)

Drafts is ready for iOS 15 and macOS 12! Updated for compatibility, of course, but also to take advantage of some of the great new features. New details below, but Drafts works great with “Live Text” to capture text from images, has full support for Shortcuts on the Mac, and brings great new iPad features, like powerful external keyboard menus.

### New Apple Watch App

![r28-2|641x396](upload://wFBC9hpsE5e3zTOnavMF5WuB1T)

We have re-written the Drafts Apple Watch app from the ground up to use the latest watchOS technologies. It’s still the best, easiest way to capture ideas on the go, but has a few new tricks:

* Multiple complication types to capture, capture with options, or see your inbox or flagged draft count.
* Inbox drafts synced to watch now reflect your default workspace options on the phone.
* Flagged drafts now also synced to the watch.
* Requires watchOS 7.1 or greater.

*[Learn More About Drafts on Apple Watch →](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/applewatch)*

### Shortcuts Support on macOS 12

We’re ready for Shortcuts on the Mac! It’s just not quite ready for us. Look for full, cross-platform support for all of Drafts’ Shortcuts actions when macOS 12 (Monterey) is released in the coming weeks!

We’re ready for Shortcuts on the Mac! It’s just not quite ready for us. Look for full, cross-platform support for all of Drafts’ Shortcuts actions when macOS 12 (Monterey) is released in the coming weeks!

In the meantime, enjoy these new shortcut actions on iOS:

* **Get Current Draft**: Retrieves the draft object for the draft currently open in the editor.
* **Open Draft Enhancements**: The “Open Draft” shortcut action now has a bunch of additional optional parameters to configure Drafts while opening - to load a workspace, actions groups, hide/show the drafts and action lists, etc. Great for bookmarking a specific set of options in a Shortcut.
*[Learn More About Shortcuts →](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/shortcuts)*

## Folder Bookmarks

Up to now, Drafts file actions and scripts have been limited to working with files in the “Drafts” folder in iCloud Drive (or by working directly with cloud-provider APIs, like Dropbox and Google Drive). With folder bookmarks, it is now possible to grant permissions to additional folders outside the Drafts App Sandbox, making it easier to integrate with other apps and services, to, say, export a draft content to another system - like an Obsidian Vault, etc.

*[Learn More About Bookmarks → ](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/settings/bookmarks)*

## Document Scanning and Live Text Support

Drafts has been tested and works great with the new “Live Text” features in iOS 15 and macOS 12. In addition, we have incorporated document scanning to OCR directly in the iOS app. Tap and hold the “+” and select “Scan Document” to open the document scanning camera. It supports scanning multi-page documents, and directly runs the results through OCR to create a new draft with the result text.

*[Learn More About Live Text & Scanning → ](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/editor/document-scanning)*

## Share Extension and Capture Window Updates

Drafts capture flow used in the iOS Share extension and the “Capture” window on Mac, has received a number of updates:

* Both now remember your recently used selections for appending and prepending to existing drafts, to make it easier to re-use active drafts.
* The Mac Share extension now displays in a new capture window, allow preview/editing of captured text as well as appending-prepending to other drafts - more like the iOS Share extension.
* Mac Services menu now contains “Capture to Drafts” and “Capture to Drafts with Options” services to send text selections to Drafts from anywhere in the system. The “with Options” version displays a capture window, while the other version capture silently as a new draft.
* New `/capture` URL scheme, and Shortcut “Show Capture” action, allow you display the capture window in app, optionally pre-filled with text and tags. This is useful in capture workflows from other apps, as well as web bookmarklets.

*Learn more about the [iOS Share Extension](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/share) and [Mac Capture Window](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/extensions/capture-window)*

## General Improvements

* New tag suggestion interface on iOS to make it easier to tag your drafts with just the right tags.
* On iOS, long press on links to other drafts now generates a preview and several command options for the draft. This includes `[[wiki-style]]` links, or `drafts://open` links in link mode.
* On Mac, `command-click` on links to other drafts to open them in a new window.
* Tags in the tag filter pane now have contextual menu (tap and hold) with “rename” and “delete” commands to bulk manage tags. These options already existed in the draft list “Operations” commands, but these versions pre-fill the tag value for better accuracy.

#### Other Updates and Fixes

### All Platforms

* New “What’s New” screen accessible via Settings > What’s New (iOS) or Help > What’s New (macOS)
* “Run Shortcut” action step has new “Return to Drafts” option. If disabled, Drafts will not include callback parameters to return to Drafts after completing the Shortcut. If you do not care about a result from Shortcuts, and wish to end up in a different app when the shortcut finishes, disable this option.
* `[[hashtags]]` template tag. Returns assigned tags as comma-separated list, with each tag prefixed with a “#”. Convenience tag to remove the need to script this conversion when exporting to systems that use hash tags.
* Estimated read time now calculated and displayed in draft detail `(i)` screen.
* **Fix:** Markdown syntaxes not recognizing [ref][links] with space.
* **Fix:** After success “Trash” would not load next draft properly in focus mode.

### iOS

* Refactor the next-previous button logic because it was not updating properly in some cases.
* A few new app icon options.
* Require iOS 14.1 or greater.
* Remove pre-iOS 14 “Today” widgets.

### Mac

* More toolbar options to customize your toolbar. Focus, link modes, preview, arrange buttons now available.
* List types returned from AppleScript not converted properly to JavaScript arrays.

### Scripting, Shortcuts, and URL Schemes

* `version.delete()` function to allow scripted deletion of versions in the version history. ([docs](https://scripting.getdrafts.com/classes/version#delete))
* `ActionLog` script object used to read and manipulation entries in the Action Log. Generally accessed from the `draft.actionLogs` property. ([docs](https://scripting.getdrafts.com/classes/actionlog))
* `/scandocument` URL scheme. ([docs](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/urlschemes#scandocument))
* `editor.scanDocument() -> string` function. Also similar to `editor.dictate()` function, opens the document scanner and returns any OCR results as a string which you can do with as you please. ([docs](https://scripting.getdrafts.com/classes/editor#scandocument))
* New “Get Current Draft” shortcut action retreives the draft currently open in the main editor.
* “Open Draft” shortcut action has additional options to configure state of window (show/hide side panes, load workspace, etc. - [docs](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/shortcuts#open-draft))
* `/open` and `/create` URL schemes now support several additional parameters to configure the environment ([docs](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/automation/urlschemes#open)):
  * `showDraftList` [true/false]
  * `showActionList` [true/false]
  * `loadWorkspace`, `loadActionGroup`, `loadActionBarGroup`: take names of valid group/workspaces and applies them

# Underdocumented Maneuvers in iOS

![Underdocumented iOS Maneuvers ](https://i.snap.as/vYlsxofN.jpg)

## Peep this dope listicle of iPhone Pro Tips

It became most apparent during my research for [my iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45) that Apple’s mobile operating system and all that it entails has changed profoundly over the course of its history even moreso than is immediately obvious. The operating system that thwarted the very idea of the Power User currently has numerous features that were added explicitly for them. (One might suggest this really began in iOS 12, with [Siri Shortcuts](http://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review).) The trouble is that many of these features overlap into what the most average user might use in their day-to-day operation of their handsets and tablets. **Showing timestamps in iMessage**, for instance, is a function which one should not have to stumble upon or take to an internet search to find. (<u>Swipe from right to left in a conversation</u>.) Little functions like this are incredibly poorly documented, considering iOS is maintained by the most valuable company in the history of the world.

Apple does make an effort to educate new users, mainly through the [Tips app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tips/id1069509450), which has indeed become more useful and insightful over time, but still leaves a whole lot to be desired. They also publish an owner’s manual-esque *[iPhone Users Guide](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=1515995528)*, which is unfortunately completely inaccessible in any format outside of the native Books app. (I made a not-insignificant effort to convert the volume to a PDF for your sake, but found myself completely defeated by DRM, hilariously.) Some of the functions listed in this post are accompanied by links to Apple Support web pages, but far too many have no such entries, which - from my perspective - is absolutely inexcusable on Apple’s part. Inexcusable, but perhaps not inexplicable. 

It would seem that the vast ecosystem of both professional and amateur technology media which reports on iOS has inadvertently filled in for Apple in the role of documentarian. Search YouTube for “iPhone Tips” and you’ll manifest a multitude of results with titles like *[16 ACTUAL iPhone Tricks You Didn’t Know Existed!](https://youtu.be/YKOY6-ZdUo8)* which haphazardly (and often distastefully) do the company’s job for them. Scrolling through said search results, I am compelled to reflect on all the *largely unpaid labor* for Apple, Inc. found there, but I will spare you such reflection for this Guide Post and promise to do my best to stick to function.

## Syntax

For this "guide," I think it's worth establishing a sort of micro-styleguide to begin with. When referring to a *function* or *task* I'm about to show you how to accomplish, its name will be in **bold text**. (Ex. **Close all Tabs in Safari**.) The *action(s)* or *input(s)* required to complete said task <u>will be underlined</u>. (Ex. <u>Long press on Tabs Icon</u>.)

## From the Community

My suspicion regarding the general sentiment among iOS users was largely validated by the response to [**a thread I posted in r/iOS**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ios/comments/l5p7ly/underdocumented_ios_functions_stuff_you_wish/).

Ease of use was leaned heavily upon by Apple in iPhone OS' adolescence as justification for its omission of certain features (both actively and by chance) which its direct, Android-running rivals would then often make their next flagship int

I got a request a few weeks ago to… chill out… from an authority I respect very much, who noted how positive the community was. I still feel like it was a misunderstanding, but that doesn’t mean they weren’t justified in that request, so I do want to apologize if my griping has been disruptive. 

if you didn’t know me on this site 10 years ago, you may not know that I was once a card-carrying, Mac vs. Windows joke t-shirt wearing Apple Boy, absolutely in love with iPhone and imperviously excited about the future of consumer technology.

the truths I have discovered in the details of the narrative history - just how much of Apple’s “innovation” has been dependent on open source projects, for example - has indeed soured things for me, but in talking about them, I’m not trying to spread that sourness, but rather to be *constructively critical*.

Topic: Discussing the developer/public beta versions of Shortcuts
==============================================================

[12-35-2019 01:35 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
At some point, maybe in the recent developer betas of iOS, “tap to scroll to top” while selecting a shortcut was fixed and I am very happy


[12-36-2019 01:36 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Now I can select a shortcut and move it to the top or bottom immediately


[12-58-2019 01:58 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Wait even weirder, it might only work while I am using the Apple Pencil - since there’s no “touch” input registered, I can still tap to scroll to top. But when I’m not using the pencil it doesn’t work...

Oh well, it works! 🤷


[03-35-2019 09:35 PM] HilliTech#2480
I have the old shortcuts app on my iPad Pro but the new one on my iphone? Hmmmm


[04-28-2019 12:28 AM] BastianInuk#2009
you on 13? 😮


[04-30-2019 01:30 AM] HilliTech#2480
I’m on the dev beta on every device. iPhone, iPad Pro, iPad mini, Mac mini, Apple Watch


[04-40-2019 02:40 AM] BastianInuk#2009
damn!


[04-41-2019 02:41 AM] BastianInuk#2009
I can't unxib xcode, and my iPhone won't show in finder


[04-36-2019 09:36 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
I am only on the beta on my 11” iPad. Because lots of apps are not launching for me.


[04-42-2019 09:42 AM] HilliTech#2480
Luckily my photography and writing apps are all that is crucial, so updating wasn’t too much of a danger. Most everything is smooth here


[04-43-2019 09:43 AM] HilliTech#2480
App grouping is broken when trying to add an app to split view that isnt in the dock. That is my biggest annoyance so far


[04-44-2019 09:44 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Yeah that was in the release notes.


[04-44-2019 09:44 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
I’m having to live vicariously through you @HilliTech


[04-44-2019 09:44 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
No Mac to flash the beta.


[04-46-2019 09:46 AM] HilliTech#2480
😢 beta 2s drop a week or two from the first one. And since this one is buggy we should see an update sooner rather than later


[04-47-2019 09:47 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
I’m hopeful that it’ll go back to profiles before the public beta.


[04-48-2019 09:48 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
As I said in our message group Hilli, wanting to make some training materials for teachers that cover iPadOS


[04-49-2019 09:49 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
With the oldest devices being iPad 2 and iPad mini 4 offering support, lots of schools will need support on new features and ways of working.


[07-24-2019 03:24 PM] Kieran Mansfield#5416
I’m very tempted to install iOS 13 when the public beta comes out as long as it’s not as buggy as iOS 11 😂


[07-26-2019 03:26 PM] BastianInuk#2009
I am not saying it's buggy


[07-27-2019 03:27 PM] BastianInuk#2009
But I got 6 inquiries in feedback app


[07-13-2019 06:13 PM] Kieran Mansfield#5416
Also 3D Touch has been replaced with haptic touch and apparently it’s slow and not great... 🙄


[07-06-2019 10:06 PM] HilliTech#2480
Its hard to judge that based on beta 1. Could be an issue with deployment targets being glitched. We shall see what they intend in later betas.


[12-13-2019 06:13 AM] koshakji#0791
Does Siri show the list and ask for selection if you have a Choose from List action in a Shortcut?


[12-03-2019 08:03 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Thats me on the Catalina and iPadOS betas. So far they seem fine. iPadOS is stable on my Pro. I pushed Catalina hard on this 2014 Mac mini yesterday and it struggled. Think it may have been the mac more than anything else.


[12-03-2019 08:03 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Today its fine. Installed iPadOS no problem despite issues yesterday.


[12-41-2019 12:41 PM] Verso#7005
I tend to stick to the Star Trek Movie rule of betas: Only bother with the even numbered ones (:

{Reactions}
💯 

[12-50-2019 02:50 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
@koshakji Most of the Siri stuff isn’t working in b1, but yes it should work


[12-51-2019 02:51 PM] koshakji#0791
That's awesome! I was afraid it was just for 3rd party apps


[13-12-2019 02:12 AM] BastianInuk#2009
Siri often complains of lack of internet when I try and turn off light bulbs

I saw this last night. I really like this.


[14-04-2019 09:04 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Nice!


[14-04-2019 09:04 AM] BastianInuk#2009
Flag day?


[14-05-2019 09:05 AM] J_#6969
Not flag day so much as if it was the Sunday before Memorial Day or something, it would remind me to not wake up early.


[14-06-2019 09:06 AM] BastianInuk#2009
What self centered country has a flag day?

[17-16-2019 12:16 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
Beta 2 out now, sacrificing my iPhone now.


[17-17-2019 12:17 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Is it an OTA @Christopher Lawley ?


[17-17-2019 12:17 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
Yep!


[17-17-2019 12:17 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Not showing up for me yet.


[17-18-2019 12:18 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
The servers must be getting hit hard right now, it says it'll take an hour to download.


[17-18-2019 12:18 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
I would just give it a minute, it'll show up.


[17-23-2019 12:23 PM] BastianInuk#2009
hype!


[17-23-2019 12:23 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Showing up now.


[17-27-2019 12:27 PM] BastianInuk#2009
not for me


[17-27-2019 12:27 PM] BastianInuk#2009
can I like connect to your cache?


[17-27-2019 12:27 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Back to profiles @BastianInuk


[17-27-2019 12:27 PM] BastianInuk#2009
maybe it goes geographically closedt to the hq?


[17-04-2019 01:04 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
The only thing that's keeping me from putting it on my iPad Pro is that LumaFusion 2.0 export is broke on iOS 13/iPadOS. It's kind of something I need.


[17-14-2019 02:14 PM] Verso#7005
Thanks for the b2 heads up! I think I've convinced Mr Kelly to volunteer his iPad Air 2 as tribute


[17-04-2019 03:04 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Here’s the new actions I’ve found

Four new actions in Shortcuts from developer beta 2:

1. Hand Off Playback (from source to destination)
2. Set Appearance (light/dark)
3. Get All Alarms
4. A “Location” alternative to Street Address

[17-07-2019 03:07 PM] koshakji#0791
Is there a way to toggle appearance? Like switch to the other based on which is currently active


[17-37-2019 03:37 PM] HilliTech#2480
Ah yes. This is exactly what thousands of dollars in hardware should amount to: the ability to play runescape with a mouse on an external display. 😂

Except when you need to export. 😆


[17-03-2019 05:03 PM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
My shortcuts are fixed!


[17-34-2019 05:34 PM] HilliTech#2480
Yay!!


[17-35-2019 05:35 PM] HilliTech#2480
My only issue so far is my camera workflow is broken. The camera shows up in files, i can see the raw images, but when i try to copy them out, i get an error stating that the container app didnt respond. Big oof


[17-36-2019 05:36 PM] HilliTech#2480
So right now my workaround is import with the Mac mini to my USB C drive i use for my ipad.


[18-50-2019 01:50 AM] BastianInuk#2009
Dope!


[18-50-2019 01:50 AM] BastianInuk#2009
I didn't realise I had to get the profile to get beta 2 OTA


[18-11-2019 04:11 AM] BastianInuk#2009
I encountered something that I can't tell if intended behaviour, do I #FileARadar™?


[18-11-2019 04:11 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Yes


[18-11-2019 04:11 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
If it’s not clear that its intended behaviour then they ought to know about it. They can always close it as intended behaviour


[18-12-2019 04:12 AM] BastianInuk#2009
Thx rose


[18-12-2019 04:12 AM] BastianInuk#2009

Anyone on beta2 able to run a Shortcut on a locked phone that could not be run before without opening the phone?


[15-46-2019 02:46 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
@leddy Do you have a specific example? I can test it


[15-46-2019 02:46 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I was hoping there'd be another beta today, but I've lost track of the cycle


[15-21-2019 10:21 PM] leddy#3717
@Matthew Cassinelli  Spence getting the public beta I’ve been playing around with some test Shortcuts on IOS 13 to see which actions can be run without opening the phone. Here is one.

[16-09-2019 12:09 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
@leddy Can you post the image here? I can’t see that on iOS 13


[16-11-2019 12:11 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
We’re due a developer beta today aren’t we? Dev beta 3 was 2nd July.


[16-13-2019 12:13 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
There’s a 4th Catalina Beta so I’d imagine iOS/iPadOS aren’t too far behind.


[16-40-2019 12:40 PM] leddy#3717

So you can now keep asking Siri questions in the Shortcuts app with out having to open the phone. This  is very cool.  There are so many ideas swirling in my head about different use cases.


[16-24-2019 05:24 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Oh nice it does work, cool. I bet if it has to access personal information it won’t


[17-49-2019 12:49 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
We have betas....


[17-50-2019 12:50 PM] koshakji#0791
New dev betas?


[17-50-2019 12:50 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
Yeah dev beta 4.


[17-25-2019 02:25 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Everything is so fast


[17-31-2019 08:31 PM] nahumck#8444
I need to know that it's not losing data and that specific apps work. I'll give it a few days. Even though it would be nice to do it while I'm not working


[18-42-2019 02:42 PM] leddy#3717
Public Beta 3 is out.

Anyone trying the public beta so far?


[18-16-2019 03:16 PM] koshakji#0791
I’m on public beta 2 on my iPhone and iPad. Downloading the update now


[18-23-2019 03:23 PM] koshakji#0791
(It’s gonna take a while though, I have really slow internet 😂)


[18-37-2019 04:37 PM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Pleased to see more than 8 menu items are now working in pb3, now would be good to fix the prompts on the menus, I often use a multi line text box for the prompt at present it displays only the last line. Just sending a radar now


[18-54-2019 04:54 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
@nikond3 (Control Centre) I do that same thing, I'll file it too


[18-55-2019 04:55 PM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
@Matthew Cassinelli just noticed it only happens with more than 7 items on the menu

I was but eventually it stopped


[18-23-2019 08:23 PM] leddy#3717
If statement conditions still only offer two conditions if there are more than one share sheet input option.

Yes


[18-46-2019 11:46 PM] leddy#3717
I wonder if there different bugs between IOS and iPad IOS now?


[18-47-2019 11:47 PM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Most likely but if you change the options from anything then add them back in this is how I got this to work, I don’t think it’s a bug just a set of conditions.


[18-49-2019 11:49 PM] leddy#3717
This is what i get when i add just one more input option.

Yes I can repeat that exactly the same.


[19-07-2019 12:07 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Click on the shortcut input and change it from App Store to date or text now it’s conditional


[19-08-2019 12:08 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
It’s not a bug just setting up!


[19-10-2019 12:10 AM] leddy#3717
Ha. Ok. When you say “just setting up” what do you mean?


[19-13-2019 12:13 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Shortcuts are dumb till you tell them what to do like any computer setting up the correct parameters it’s frustrating getting I know but just try clicking things, that’s how you find out I came across this with something I was trying to do a month ago that’s how I found out.


[19-17-2019 12:17 AM] leddy#3717
Ah. I think I see what you’re saying. The thing of it is I was able to have more than one input in “If” actions and still have more than 2 conditional options in IOS 12 but now can’t seem to get the same conditions in IOS 13.


[19-22-2019 12:22 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
iOS 13 is a game changer it’s parameter based now  ios 12 was more condition based  I.e if the weather is raining yes or now, now it’s more like Will it rain today if so when and where, there is more bang for your buck.


[19-06-2019 10:06 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I feel like this should work without you having to coerce the Shortcut Input variable


[19-36-2019 10:36 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Yes I agree, that image above there is another story to it, it only works with DATE AND TIME would be much more useful with time only. Already sent a radar.

Does anyone else really hate the new Update UI in the App Store? It’s weird to me that they made the OS more iPad specific and changed the update dialog from full screen to tiny window

You can add to that the shortcuts menus we make are so small on iPad already radar that too crazy.

Hi @nikond3 (Control Centre) , thanks for beating me to the punch and posting that link to my Reddit post. I wanted to share it here in hopes of stimulating some discussion and maybe gathering some support for the ideas.

Update: There's an iOS 13 version there now too.


[24-12-2019 06:12 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
@prolost How’s it been updating your shortcuts for iOS 13? Aside from the issues above


[25-03-2019 07:03 AM] BastianInuk#2009
So is the duplicate dirs in iCloud on iOS 13 common?


[25-14-2019 11:14 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
It’ll be fixed in the next release


[25-14-2019 11:14 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
They had it in the works but it didn’t make it into the last beta


[25-48-2019 03:48 PM] BastianInuk#2009

In iOS 13 beta 5, Personal automation (triggers, NFC, etc.) has been removed from Shortcuts. It appears that Shortcuts-based HomeKit automations are gone too.

I hope this is just temporary. Would suck if Apple didn't ship these major features at all. https://t.co/5YWd8WIh...

@Matthew Cassinelli Mail on the iPad is frozen, no matter what I do. Widgets are showing unable to load a lot of the time. Still can’t get apps to work in slide over from spotlight. There was a couple other things, but they’re not coming to mind right now. The big one was mail, I’ll have to install spark.

@Christopher Lawley Ugh. Haven't updated my iPad Pro to developer beta 5 yet, but the Mail app on the Catalina beta crashes every five minutes or so. The Mail app on my iPhone (which is on dev beta 5) throws up a "new email" screen every time I open it.

Hi folks! I’m on the iOS 13 beta and am trying to figure out how to feed information to Siri without having to launch the app. I thought “Ask for Input” would do it, but whenever I trigger it via Siri it just kicks me into Shortcuts with a prompt to enter my input. Any way I can do this fully by voice, with device locked?


[12-18-2019 03:18 PM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Have you tried the dictation action?


[12-20-2019 03:20 PM] tedsvo#2044
Hm, but that still requires unlocking the device. I had thought that we could use standard “ask for input” actions which we could enter by text if we triggered the shortcut with touch, and via Siri if we triggered it via Airpods or voice. Is that not the case?


[12-29-2019 03:29 PM] koshakji#0791
I remeber this working in an earlier beta, I can’t get it to work with pub;ic beta 5


[12-30-2019 03:30 PM] tedsvo#2044
Maybe that’s what it is. I could’ve sworn this worked at some point. @Matthew Cassinelli can you confirm?


[12-17-2019 11:17 PM] leddy#3717
Yeah. Same here. All my Siri “conversation” Shortcuts no longer work. Get “you need to unlock your iPhone first”. Put in a Feedback. Hope that gets sores out soon.

[21-42-2019 04:42 PM] EconWriter#1131
Been having substantial issues (basically since the earliest dev betas) with mouse support on my iPad Pro. The mouse works as expected, but two things (bugs?) are quite infuriating and make mouse support with the iPad unusable.  1.) although I use a keyboard attached nearly 100% of the time (in particular, the Smart Keyboard cover, but I have the same problem with a Bluetooth connected Magic Keyboard), the software keyboard comes up every time I enter a text field. Dismissing the software keyboard makes the cursor disappear - so, in other words, I can only type using a hardware keyboard with the software keyboard taking up half the screen. Not ideal.  Changing various settings in “Accessibility” does not change this. 2.) when I try to use the fast app switcher via the keyboard shortcut command-tab, the selector runs rapidly back and forth between all the selectable apps, like I’ve just pulled the lever on a slot machine. Can’t stop it without pressing command-tab again (and even then it doesn’t always stop). And it’s so quick it’s impossible to time it to stop on desired app (and, frankly, I don’t think the fast app switcher was designed to be a wait-for-it-oops!-just-missed-it sort of interaction). In other words, I know it was meant to be a “fast” app switcher, but not this fast! Plus, this occurs without any user interaction - it would continue to cycle through the apps rapidly if I simply took my hands off the keyboard.


[21-42-2019 04:42 PM] EconWriter#1131
So, is my first problem supposed to be how mouse support for the iPad works? And anybody experiencing the same thing with the fast app switcher as I am?


[24-57-2019 04:57 PM] prolost#9517
Is this a safe place to say that I think Shortcuts has mostly gotten worse in iOS 13? It feels like a lot of changes were made due to the introduction of Automations. Which has been removed. Temporarily, I’m sure, but in the meantime we’re left with one positive change to Shortcut editing — the concept of Actions having arbitrary inputs — that so far has brought with it plenty of strife, bugs, and more tap-intensive UX to do basic things. And then so many negatives. No more backing up Shortcuts to files. When our friends load our Shortcuts they have to scroll through the whole mess (as if that does anything) and press a terrifying red button. The Shortcuts editing experience has taken many steps back in usability, which I laboriously documented on Reddit to absolutely no result. The net is, I feel relief every time I go back to editing Shortcuts on my iOS 12 devices, and then sadness, because so much of what I love about the process is about to be taken away for a reason that has also been taken away.


[24-58-2019 04:58 PM] prolost#9517
Oops forgot to mention the forced search in Choose From list, which screws up my pretty menus. And the pointless tiny menus on iPad that once filled the screen.


[24-59-2019 04:59 PM] prolost#9517
I’m just very sad about all of it. I was having such a love affair with Shortcuts.


[24-02-2019 05:02 PM] koshakji#0791
I think the new editor could be an improvement, if refined. It's worse now but I can get behind the thinking if they could improve it. I also like the search field (though maybe it should be optional) but the small menus on the iPad infuriate me


[24-03-2019 05:03 PM] koshakji#0791
Otherwise, I agree. It's a small stepback, but I think automations and improvements to the current editor would make it a huge step forward


[24-07-2019 05:07 PM] prolost#9517
If the search was optional I’d be thrilled. It’s a great feature, but the threshold is 7 items, and it should be more like double that. And still optional.


[24-08-2019 05:08 PM] prolost#9517
I very much hope we’re in the “break a few eggs” phase of making a great omelette, but Apple usually doesn’t like to ship regressions, and these UX issues are massive regressions.


[26-48-2019 04:48 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704

I still can’t get Siri to ask for input, but I imagine they’re aware of this.

@tedsvo Hmm. iCloud folder sharing doesn't appear to be in this release.

Looks like Siri  Ask For Input is back too! Happy Days!

Thanks Stephen, bummer. But yay for ask for input AND matched text groups working!

I was hoping to start filming my iOS 13 walkthrough this weekend. Now I’m not sure what I should do. Does iOS 13.1 feel buggier then 13.0 did? I may just stick to 13.0 current beta until I’m done filming everything. Better the devil you know.


[27-17-2019 06:17 PM] tedsvo#2044
13.1 feels quite stable


[27-17-2019 06:17 PM] tedsvo#2044
I’d say more so than prior beta


[27-18-2019 06:18 PM] EconWriter#1131
Feels very stable to me too. Definitely fixed many of the problems I had with earlier beta builds.


[27-41-2019 06:41 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I’m so glad to have Automations back


[27-27-2019 09:27 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
Mhmmmmmm maybe I’ll update my iPad and then showcase the features that are coming in 13.1 in my 13.0 walkthrough.


[27-35-2019 09:35 PM] tedsvo#2044
Do any of you have NFC tags you prefer over others?

Pinging @Matthew Cassinelli in particular


[27-48-2019 09:48 PM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
I've seen suggestions (on Reddit, so not official by any stretch) that 13.1 may be available shortly after launch and that 13.0 had to be put onto the new devices already.


[28-00-2019 02:00 AM] BastianInuk#2009
13.0 already flashed on the new iPhones?


[28-01-2019 02:01 AM] BastianInuk#2009
Damn!


[28-01-2019 02:01 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
I don't know how realistic that is, but if there are significant hardware changes they may be expecting more sales than usual?


[28-23-2019 02:23 AM] BastianInuk#2009
I thought S revisions where the big sellers?


[28-23-2019 02:23 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195

Regardless I'm now on the .1 train, twoot twoot


[28-35-2019 06:35 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
@tedsvo I haven’t even tested mine yet!


[28-36-2019 06:36 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Is the general consensus that 13.1 will drop when the iPhone ships? I am seriously confused, will people not get Automations until October?


[28-36-2019 06:36 AM] tedsvo#2044
I have yet to see a consensus emerge


[28-36-2019 06:36 AM] tedsvo#2044
Gruber suggested October with iPads


[28-36-2019 06:36 AM] koshakji#0791
Why would they call it 13.1 then? I believe 13 will launch with the iPhones and 13.1 later


[28-37-2019 06:37 AM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
That’s a good question. There are no indications that this will be an iPhone only release. I’d imagine we could see the iPhones ship with iOS 13 and upgrade to 13.1 shortly after?


[28-32-2019 07:32 AM] tedsvo#2044
Re: NFC tags, while Launch Center Pro tags are keyed to LCP URLs, they do still work (they just also suggest opening LCP)


[28-45-2019 11:45 AM] EconWriter#1131
Mouse functionality is much less buggy on 13.1 , but some big bugs still persist. Having a mouse attached seems to disable most keyboard shortcuts on my iPad Pro, and I get lots of dropped keystrokes when typing. Command-tab doesn’t work at all. For that matter, no command-key based “keyboard accelerators” work. Can’t navigate in Safari with the keyboard either. This occurs with both the Magic Keyboard connected via Bluetooth and the Smart Keyboard cover. Anyone else experiencing this? Or is this supposed to be how it works (i.e., iOS assumes that if you have a mouse attached that you won’t be using a keyboard to navigate - although that would not explain the dropped keystrokes)?


[28-10-2019 12:10 PM] Verso#7005
It certainly sounds like we might be reliving the days where the first thing you did with your phone out of the box was check for updates


[28-38-2019 12:38 PM] leddy#3717
Public Beta 13.1 is out. My gut feeling is they will push out 13.1 sooner than later.


[28-40-2019 12:40 PM] tedsvo#2044
13.1 beta 1 🙂


[28-46-2019 12:46 PM] leddy#3717
I’ve been holding off putting the betas on my main devices but I’m diving in with 13.1. The strange thing is they will probably never be loaded with 13.0!


[28-06-2019 02:06 PM] tedsvo#2044
@EconWriter I have not encountered this. Every now and then the keyboard will get funky and I’ll just disconnect and reconnect the mouse


[28-06-2019 02:06 PM] tedsvo#2044
One thing I noticed is that having both a Smart Keyboard and BT keyboard connected simultaneously is a bad idea. What kind of mouse have you been using?


[28-06-2019 02:06 PM] tedsvo#2044
I must say, being able to map right click to “long press” is absolutely *awesome*


[28-17-2019 02:17 PM] EconWriter#1131
@tedsvo I absolutely love mouse support when it works for me. And even before iOS 13 betas, the disconnect-and-reconnect thing worked for me too - but, alas, doesn’t do the trick when a mouse is attached now. I also have tried only connecting one keyboard at a time, like you suggest, but that doesn’t solve the problem either. I have wondered if the mouse is the issue - it’s a pretty cheap Dell mouse that has one of those universal USB-A wireless receivers. I plug that into the USB-C to USB-A dongle for the iPad Pro. The wonky keyboard behavior is consistent with using a wired mouse too (again a cheap Dell one). Maybe I need to just get a better mouse. Kinda’ bummed that I seem to be the only (or the few?) who hasn’t had the most joyful time with mouse support.


[28-19-2019 02:19 PM] EconWriter#1131
@tedsvo  Long press is indeed fantastic. I’ve actually noticed that I don’t need to map it to it’s own button. Simply long-pressing on the primary mouse key works for me.


[28-34-2019 02:34 PM] tedsvo#2044
Ah, I bet it’s the receiver. I used a Logitech one that was giving me trouble, so I switched to an MX Anywhere which is Bluetooth


[28-01-2019 03:01 PM] EconWriter#1131
@tedsvo I’ve been eyeing the MX Anywhere. I think I now have the rationalization I need to make the purchase! Thanks!


[28-26-2019 03:26 PM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Logitech receivers are interpreted as keyboards. Even on macOS.


[28-27-2019 03:27 PM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
This seems to be the same across all receivers except my super cheap keyboard and mouse that I use for Windows. They have separate dongles thoufb.


[28-42-2019 03:42 PM] EconWriter#1131
@Rosemary Orchard Ah, I didn’t know that! I suspect that’s the culprit. Thanks!


[28-49-2019 04:49 PM] tedsvo#2044
Ah that’s interesting Rosemary


[29-34-2019 03:34 AM] nikond3 (Control Centre)#1909
Does anyone else feel that Automations are a total waste of time?
Having set one up yesterday to run at Sunrise (I.e I’m a sleep at that time) I thought it had not run, so I reset it to run at a time of day, and discovered it gives you a notification that you need to press to run it! That to me is not an Automation but a trigger, thing is the notification was on screen no longer than 8 - 10 seconds? Pointless to my mind.

I’m sure this is down to some sort of security but I still see it as a waste of my time in setting something up to be automated that isn’t . Rant over......


[29-49-2019 05:49 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Some of them do need the notifications, but a fair number just run - such as the ones when you open an app.


[29-46-2019 11:46 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
@nikond3 (Control Centre) I think the name Automations just oversells it, they’re automatic triggers to run your shortcuts, either by notification or some action you take (ie Stop Alarm).

But you always have to perform the action


[29-47-2019 11:47 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
If I’m not mistaken, the only true automation is when Low Power Mode turns off, because that’s the only thing that happens automatically without requiring it to Ask When Run


[29-48-2019 11:48 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Otherwise I’m treating them as another method of making shortcuts more readily available to run when I’m ready to run them, and not really digging too deep into “what could I do if this just happened on a schedule”


[31-01-2019 10:01 AM] nahumck#8444
So, if I'm on the 13.0 beta, should I be installing the 13.1? Better? More stable? Bugs squashed?


[31-29-2019 10:29 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Yes


[31-59-2019 10:59 AM] koshakji#0791
I’ve been hearing people say you they can’t initiate split-screen using Spotlight for a while and I just noticed myself using it and it’s working for me!


[31-00-2019 11:00 AM] koshakji#0791
it doesn’t dismiss Spotlight search just by dragging, I have to press CMD+Space again to dismiss the Spotlight UI, while still holding on to the app icon


[31-01-2019 11:01 AM] koshakji#0791
I don’t remember if that’s how it worked on iOS 12 but it works now


[31-31-2019 02:31 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Yeah I am doing the same thing - it is worse than ios 12 but at least possible for now


[31-50-2019 08:50 PM] tedsvo#2044
Man. I installed tvOS beta to play with homekit automations, and this beta is buggy as hell


[31-51-2019 08:51 PM] tedsvo#2044
I incorrectly thought it would be stable by now


[02-32-2019 12:32 AM] giacomopasini#6375
Any non advanced user who is on iOS 13 and PadOS beta could tell me if the more complex iOS 12 shortcuts  has needed to be rebuilt from scratch? Did you find more difficult or easier adapt to the new Shortcuts app?


[02-03-2019 04:03 AM] leddy#3717
It’s strange. I found after upgrading that my shortcuts on my iPhone for the most part worked just fine.  But when I ran the same shortcuts on my iPad they did not work and I needed to go in and reconnect a lot of the variables. But it wasn’t too difficult a job to fix them.


[03-11-2019 12:11 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I think this 13.1 beta 1 had some reversions that were fixed in later 13.0 betas


[03-11-2019 12:11 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Hoping there's a new beta today?


[03-31-2019 12:31 PM] Zulfi#4524
Any developers here working on new shortcuts with custom parameters for iOS13? Running into a lot of issues, with custom dialog prompts not working (when they worked fine before).


[03-50-2019 02:50 PM] leddy#3717
It will be interesting to see if the 13.1 betas come out once a week or every two weeks.


[03-13-2019 03:13 PM] Conor O'Hollaren#6254
is anyone else seeing a long delay / spotty response detecting NFC stickers and firing a shortcut? (ios 13.1b1, iphone XS)


[04-19-2019 09:19 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
In general the Automations are a bit slow in this beta


[04-05-2019 12:05 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
New beta!

[04-52-2019 12:52 PM] tedsvo#2044
It occurs to me that an ideal BT mouse for iPad would have a zillion buttons that I could map to a zillion shortcuts


[04-52-2019 12:52 PM] tedsvo#2044
Is there some existing device with lots of buttons that would map to the pointing devices accessibility feature?


[04-25-2019 01:25 PM] Christopher Lawley#0452
I ordered a couple different gaming mouse's and they don't work. All the keys on the side need to be programed and iPadOS doesn't recognize them. Logitech did announce a new MX Master mouse today that I'm pretty excited about.


[04-28-2019 01:28 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I spy a secret new feature 🙂

Maybe I wasn’t meant for betas. Was FaceTimeing a friend and wanted to use Animoji. Then my screen froze. Tried to reboot but instead called 911  emergency.  I couldn’t hang up! I kept telling the operator that it was just a glitch. But she kept asking me what’s wrong. Then she sent the police! Then I guess because I couldn’t do anything with my phone it automatically called my emergency contact which was my my brother! And because my phone was totally frozen, I couldn’t do a reboot or a hard boot,  he couldn’t get through so he had to come to my place too!  This is going to be some feedback!

Could the operator hear you?


[11-22-2019 01:22 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
It's (fairly) standard protocol to assume if they receive a silent call that the person at the other end is not able to talk without endangering themselves (or that they are unable to speak due to an injury) which is why they generally send police in that situation.


[11-36-2019 02:36 AM] leddy#3717
Yes. I think she heard me. But I couldn’t get to the speaker and I was struggling with trying to reboot. All good now. The police and my brother had a good time as I tried to explain IOS 13.0 and 13.1 betas to them… 🥴


[11-15-2019 05:15 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704

Just to confirm. I’ve deleted the beta profiles in settings on my iPhone and iPad. That’s all I need to do to get the official 13.1 release tomorrow right? 😨

I believe you need to restart the device after removing the profile

Yes, a restart is necessary after either adding or removing a beta profile for the change to take effect.

Does anyone running watchOS 6.1 see the multiple combined colour options for Numerals Duo? I don’t but my dad (running public release) does.

@Rosemary Orchard I see them as options on the Watch app, but not on the actual watch

running dev 6.1


[30-34-2019 02:34 PM] nahumck#8444
when I set it on the watch face in the app, then tap "Set as current Watch Face", it turns to the red color


[30-34-2019 02:34 PM] nahumck#8444
and I'm on 13.1.1 iOS release. not sure if that makes a difference here


[01-56-2019 12:56 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
Good to know!


[01-57-2019 12:57 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
And now on the developer page at Apple I can't get profiles for iOS or iPadOS, I wonder if the universe is conspiring


[01-22-2019 05:22 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
I feel like I'm going mad. Is the most recent OS release for HomePod really 12.4?

(Regular, not developer)

Looks like it from the release notes


[01-24-2019 05:24 AM] Rosemary Orchard#7195
But the beta profiles have been pulled from the developer site. So I can't update it. Urgh


[01-31-2019 05:31 PM] EconWriter#1131
So, no new betas for those of us who don’t have an iPhone 11-line phone yet?

My iPad got an update

I'm out of the loop


[02-53-2019 08:53 AM] EconWriter#1131
Both my iPad Pro and XS Max received iOS 13.1.2, but it’s not listed as a dev or public beta build. Yet I have a dev beta profile on both devices.


[02-11-2019 12:11 PM] EconWriter#1131
Okay, now I feel silly. I just received the dev beta. Never mind!


[02-15-2019 12:15 PM] koshakji#0791
There's nothing to feel silly about, Apple talked about a beta before releasing it


[02-15-2019 12:15 PM] BobWinNV#4781
I just noticed that the 13.2 beta profiles are up on Apple developer now.

@Rosemary Orchard The update isn't for Homepod, it's just for iPhone

HomePod is still 12.4

Is anyone else having issues with the WiFi and screen brightness actions? As in, the shortcut stalls on them

Just tested on 13.2, both worked okay

Odd. They're consistently causing issues here. Time for a reboot.

Working okay on multiple devices, but I only tested a two action shortcut containing both actions

Must say I’m very bummed about watch shortcuts still failing, now that all the updates have been released

@Rosemary Orchard are your watch shortcuts working, or still no?

Mine are working, but not which health stuff


[29-24-2019 07:24 PM] tedsvo#2044
Shoot really? Can you share a sample shortcut that works?


[30-48-2019 10:48 AM] tedsvo#2044
Ok, so at this point I can get basic non-Health shortcuts to run, but anything from third party devs does not run and anything involving HealthKit does not run

[05-37-2019 01:37 PM] mcoutts81 (he/him)#8763
I’m the same. Not wanting to go back on a beta but if it sorts the memory management issues then that’s tempting. Although they could potentially release 13.2.1 to sort those issues.


[05-49-2019 01:49 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704

In the latest beta, comment and text boxes expand as you type long text and seems to remain expanded to the length of the text. Great for detailed comments and no longer a need to scroll the little box area to read long details.

What do you mean specifically?


[12-15-2021 03:15 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Jellycuts used to export a Jellycut, by sending a .shortcut file through an action into the shortcuts app. This would then be uploaded to icloud through the get icloud link action. This link would then be opened in the app. 

But now that doesn't work, they changed how the icloud link action functions, and you can no longer create a link for an unsigned shortcut. There is also no way to import a file that is unsigned or outdated. 

So I either have to find a work-around, or I have to setup a mac server or mac VM server too run the new Shortucts CLI tool to manually sign the shortcuts. But then that requires giving everyone who uses shortcuts a contact file for the iCloud account logged into that VM.

macOS Monterey Shortcuts - First look
Apple announced macOS Monterey (macOS 12) this week at WWDC, and one of its new features that caught my eye is Shortcuts. It’s already available on iOS, but it made its way to macOS. My security focused brain immediately thought about how cool this feature could be for red teamers or pentesters to persist on macOS :) So I decided to take a quick...


[12-13-2021 04:13 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Very interesting dive into the Shortcuts sqlite database


[12-13-2021 04:13 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
The reason the shortcuts can;t be convereted is because of how they are signed


[12-13-2021 04:13 PM] atnbueno#9460
I was just looking into that


[12-13-2021 04:13 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yeah, I was told, It will be nearly impossible to reverse the encryption


[12-14-2021 04:14 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
But then again, nothing's impossible


[12-14-2021 04:14 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Everything is signed to your iCloud account, and from what I can tell a bit of the data is 1 way hashed


[12-17-2021 04:17 PM] atnbueno#9460
I wasn't thinking about reversing it, but if it was possible to sign (notarize?) with standard tools like OpenSSL. Currently reading this:

[12-17-2021 04:17 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Hmm


[12-17-2021 04:17 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
We may be able to sign it off of the iCloud ID


[12-18-2021 04:18 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Cause that's what they sign off of


[12-20-2021 05:20 PM] zjtech123#6743
This also means copypasting shortcuts and embedders like ActionCuts, MergeCuts, Swing Embedded, Quick Embedded etc etc are **no longer possible** without a helper


[12-21-2021 05:21 PM] zjtech123#6743
Which sucks to be honest

[12-44-2021 06:44 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
So I have not gotten to this level, what does this mean practically? Like generated shortcuts aren’t authorized to be installed on other devices?

I just want to make sure I understand


[12-44-2021 06:44 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
If you want I can jump in a call and try to explain it better than I can in text


[12-45-2021 06:45 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
If not i can write up a decent explanation of all of it


[12-45-2021 06:45 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Just let me know


[12-48-2021 06:48 PM] eaic#2832
basically the embedders work by modifying the shortcuts plists and on ios 12 they could import directly


[12-48-2021 06:48 PM] FifiTheBulldog#6153
If I understand this correctly, in a nutshell it means that you can no longer install a shortcut from a file, as the only way to get an iCloud link would be to have it already in the Shortcuts app. This pretty much puts an end to the viability of shortcuts that use plist modification to create new shortcuts since it’s hard to install the customized file.


[12-48-2021 06:48 PM] FifiTheBulldog#6153
On 13 and 14 we had the luxury of Get Link to File


[12-48-2021 06:48 PM] eaic#2832
but then in ios 13 they disabled file imports but you could still work around it with the get link to file action


[12-48-2021 06:48 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yeah that's pretty accurate


[12-48-2021 06:48 PM] eaic#2832
now that's dead and you need a mac


[12-49-2021 06:49 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I thought they mentioned .shortcut files in the Mac developer session


[12-49-2021 06:49 PM] eaic#2832
yep, those used to be bplists


[12-49-2021 06:49 PM] eaic#2832
now they are a custom format

[12-49-2021 06:49 PM] eaic#2832
there are 2 kinds of signatures: personal signatures and icloud notarization


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yeah, they changed what a .shortcut is. It used to be an unsinged XML plist. It is now a signed Apple Archive plist, which is keyed with your iCloud account. Meaning that they can not be decrypted outside the shortcuts app


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] MEE6#4876
GG @ActuallyZach, you just advanced to level 2!


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
yes, but only for you and people who have you in your contacts


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Sorry I’ll disable this bot tonight


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Oh and you can generate a public icloud link with the cli


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] eaic#2832
ooh


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] eaic#2832
you can?


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] eaic#2832
nice


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yes, but idk when this is coming


[12-50-2021 06:50 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
It may be in the first version of signing, or a later version


[12-51-2021 06:51 PM] FifiTheBulldog#6153
So, what will become of RoutineHub? Will all shortcuts published there need to be signed with the CLI to create public links?


[12-51-2021 06:51 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Nope


[12-51-2021 06:51 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
They will be perfectly fine


[12-51-2021 06:51 PM] eaic#2832
the shortcuts app still makes public links


[12-51-2021 06:51 PM] MEE6#4876
GG @eaic, you just advanced to level 1!


[12-51-2021 06:51 PM] eaic#2832
just not from arbitrary plists


[12-51-2021 06:51 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yeah, public links are still created by the shortcuts app


[12-51-2021 06:51 PM] FifiTheBulldog#6153
I see


[12-52-2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
you just now have an option to restrict those icloud links to contacts


[12-52-2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
That is called a private shortcut


[12-52-2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
and can only be shared to people who have you in their contacts


[12-52-2021 06:52 PM] eaic#2832
you can also share as files right


[12-52-2021 06:52 PM] eaic#2832
if they are signed


[12-52-2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
it basically checks a hashed email that is saved in the plist against the emails in your contact book


[12-52-2021 06:52 PM] eaic#2832
it's not a plist anymore


[12-52-2021 06:52 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
Yes, but this is actually fairly buggy right now


[12-53-2021 06:53 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
It actually is, it's just decently encrypted


[12-53-2021 06:53 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
So theirs no way to extract a .plist from a .shortcut anymore


[12-53-2021 06:53 PM] eaic#2832
it's not encrypted


[12-53-2021 06:53 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
They told me it was in my lab


[12-53-2021 06:53 PM] eaic#2832
well, it's not

Maybe someone mentioned this already,  but Location automations still require you to confirm when running shortcuts.

 Focus change (on or off) do not require confirmation. 

And Focus can change based on location automatically. Seems like a way to get location based automations by using Focus as a middle man. 

Am I missing something

The “choose any folder” option in iOS/iPadOS 15 isn’t working for me. It gives me the folder picker but then it just leaves a blank where the folder name should be, and when I run the shortcut, it just goes to the Shortcuts folder when it hits that action. Anyone else?


[14-42-2021 12:42 AM] scottaw#3139
I’m referring specifically to choosing folders outside of the Shortcuts iCloud folder.


[14-42-2021 10:42 AM] gwthompson#8517
I'm thinking about using cron jobs for automating shortcuts on the mac but haven't tried it yet. Could be very powerful!


[14-02-2021 01:02 PM] Adam Tow - MixEffect.app#9582
I haven't updated my iOS devices to 15 yet, but does this mean my method for processing shortcuts in LaunchCuts and MFC Deck is going to break? I send Get My Shortcuts to my iOS app and decode the XML Plist to process and import the data.


[14-03-2021 01:03 PM] eaic#2832
the plist is still available from icloud but not sure about in the shortcuts app

[14-31-2021 01:31 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
I think it should be okay, the plists are still there, but you will need to set the name of the file to .wflow for it to convert.


[14-31-2021 01:31 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
But it may honestly just work without any changes


[14-32-2021 01:32 PM] ActuallyZach#0001
It’s beginning to confuse me when they are using .shortcut or .wflow

[15-06-2021 11:06 AM] ActuallyZach#0001
I wonder if we will see that stay through the beta's or be removed


[15-09-2021 11:09 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Honestly I think this seems like the best way to make this happen – I’ve always assumed that true location automations (and Bluetooth & the like) would misfire regularly and create a bad experience, and I think that’s why Apple hasn’t enabled them. Pairing this with deeper smarts for activating the Focus modes using Siri’s intelligence seems much more reliable and less likely to be error-prone – plus, practically most location-based automations would line up with a natural context-switching, so this seems like the way to go going forward


[15-10-2021 11:10 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Apple could add affordances for location or Bluetooth automations to run without asking, but I think like other automations I’d end up not using it because there’d be too many edge cases like reconnecting to Bluetooth or it thinking you’ve moved in/out of a location from weak signal


[15-11-2021 11:11 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
They should totally add “When a speaker is connected” and skip the literal Bluetooth part though

especially when that trigger can do limitless actions


[15-12-2021 11:12 AM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704

Possible bug: a shortcut edited in iOS 15 that includes the "Get File" action, when shared with another user in iOS 14.7, can't be installed (the preview gets stuck in the spinning thing and, although it says it has been installed, is hasn't).


[18-06-2021 07:06 AM] atnbueno#9460

Yeah this is pretty nasty. I also have this problem. In many actions if you click there is no way to choose a variable, I can only write text in it. In this example I tapped on „Objekt“ and want to select the variable from the menu above it, but I can only write text.

[22-11-2021 11:11 AM] Krispy#7094
I’m waiting for the public beta, but have started preparing for quick notes by looking for apps that work best with Siri’s “remind me about this” feature in iOS/iPadOS 14. So far I’ve found out that Spark mail, Craft, and Newsbite (RSS) work very well (they create a deep link to specific emails, RSS items, or notes) so I expect they will work well with Quick Note.


[22-16-2021 11:16 AM] koshakji#0791
I can test those apps when I get home, I have the beta. Anything else you’d like me to try?

Anyone using the macOS beta with a TouchBar-enabled Mac? I want to know what the experience is like


[22-28-2021 11:28 AM] Krispy#7094
Thanks very much! And that’s all, since Safari, notes, email, and RSS will be my main usecases. I am also pretty curious if the deep links that Quick Notes creates can be copied in other apps that use rich links. For instance, could I copy a deep link to a safari page from a Quick Note into a Craft note, and would that link function?


[22-29-2021 11:29 AM] koshakji#0791
I think they used to be not copiable when they were in Reminders, will test in Quick Notes

So, once I get my sealegs with the TouchBar, I plan to mess around with Shortcuts integration. I'm sure I'll have opinions!

I wish there was a way to customize swipe gestures with Apple Pencil. As you all know, right now swipe up from the bottom right brings up Quick Note and swipe up from bottom left takes a screenshot. I wish I could switch these since I’m left handed having the Quick Note on the left side would be better for me. When I’m using the iPad in the Magic Keyboard, not so much of an issue clearly lol

I used to do a lot of workflows with AppleScript 30 years ago and I loved it but drifted away from it so it almost feels like starting from scratch myself. I built complex workflows for newspapers using Userland Frontier before AppleScript was released in the early 90s. Workflow/Shortcuts and all of the third party additions got me back into automation and now with the coming Monterey I'm dusting off the old skills! 🙂

I'm a bit disappointed that iOS 15 didn't bring to Shortcuts anything related to widgets  😞


[23-42-2021 02:42 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Fair, but putting Shortcuts widgets in stacks on my iPad home screens activated by Focus is what's enabling me to really use them like I was trying in iOS 14, so practically they'll be here for the first time for iPad users


[23-49-2021 03:49 PM] atnbueno#9460
Imagine:
- Showing shortcuts in the widget with the same size of an app icon and/or with custom images
- Control what's on top of a widget stack with a shortcut
- Interaction between native widgets and Shortcuts (e.g. changing the photo in a Photo widget, or getting the battery of the Watch, the Pencil or the AirPods from the iPhone)


[24-51-2021 12:51 PM] EconWriter#1131
So far, it seems the only way to add Shortcuts to the Touch Bar is via the "Quick Actions" button which can be added to the normal roster of controls (volume, brightness, etc). However, revealing the Shortcuts requires tapping the Quick Action button. So, as far as I can tell, the Shortcuts can't be added directly to Touch Bar and be accessible persistently. It takes at least one extra tap to get to them.

Variable entry is still broken in some instances for example in the action to search the App Store.

I'm sorry I'm very late. I tested a bunch of apps, the ones I found to work were:
- Craft
- Newsbite
- GoodNotes
- OmniFocus
- Pocket
- Instapaper
I couldn't test Spark though because it's failing to verify my account for some reason.
And I tested copying the rich link, it doesn't work. Just copies the title if that exists.


[25-28-2021 05:28 AM] atnbueno#9460
I'm doing all my betatesting via friends ("Try this", "try that") 😁 and they tell me that in beta 2 the "Get Current IP" action works again (it didn't in beta 1). Also, it returns the real IP even in _Privacy Mode_ (CDN proxies). So comparing this IP with the one you can get from an external server (e.g. https://atnbueno.com/ip.php ) we can now detect _Privacy Mode_ from Shortcuts  😎

Thanks for going above and beyond! If those all worked, I’m guessing Spark will work, eventually, given that it works with Remind Me About This. I’m definitely a little dissapointed about the rich links though because I dont like using Apple notes as a place to organize my links, even if I’m planning on using Quick Note. I was hoping i would be able to grab those links and throw them in Craft, for example. Here’s to hoping more functionality comes in future betas. Thanks again!

Happy to help!

You can now also activate Quick Note without the pencil which is cool


[25-23-2021 12:23 PM] Krispy#7094
Keyboard shortcut?


[25-23-2021 12:23 PM] Krispy#7094
Or control center?


[25-24-2021 12:24 PM] Krispy#7094
Do you think this new option in Shortcuts is essentially generating the same rich links as in Quick Notes?

I'm having trouble figuring out how to use this in a shortcut (or how to even test it). Any tutorials you can share?


[25-29-2021 05:29 PM] atnbueno#9460
I've read you can use it to get the URL in Safari without having to use the share sheet

Here is the most basic demo of it: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/e610f46625914cc2b2b526becd002f8e

You need to start the shortcut via Siri or Spotlight with a external Keyboard, while you have a website in Safari opened. I also tried it in some other apps, but didn‘t do anything. I guess the developer has to do something in the app, to make it work.

Resolved in macOS Monterey 12 beta 2​
Fixed the Shortcuts command-line tool to correctly support signing. (74999291)
Fixed an issue where apps running under Rosetta 2 became unresponsive if Shortcuts were enabled for the Services menu. (78134762)

It's odd to me that Apple added tags to Reminders and didn't include a tag field in the "Add New Reminder" action. Is this the kind of thing that Apple devs might consider adding if I filed Feedback about it?

[30-06-2021 12:06 PM] EconWriter#1131
Not a pain at all. It is actually nice to hear (from someone like you who has communicated with people inside of Apple) that our feedback can actually have that power. I've always assumed it was intended solely to root out beta bugs.


[30-08-2021 12:08 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Feedback goes right into their ticketing system and it's tied into how every task gets done – if it's not in the system, they're not working on it.

And especially with Shortcuts, which has a million edge cases (both in terms of bugs and features) giving direct reports to them helps a ton. 

It's basically like putting a problem and solution right in front of them makes it incredibly easy to actually fix it, if we don't diagnose tihngs correctly or give thoughtful suggestions, there's a lot more work to get it done

**macOS public beta** installed, open **Shortcuts**, run first shortcut (a two-action shortcut that gets a single-page PDF file from iCloud Drive plus a Quick View action). The first time it shows the contents of the PDF, as expected (also as seen in iOS). Successive runs *don't* show the contents of the PDF, but a giant PDF icon. My first bug to report? Can anyone confirm?


[02-06-2021 01:06 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I'm seeing lots of weirdness like this where the same shortcut doesn't behave the same twice in a row. Or like when I change an action and run the shortcut, it'll run the old action first and then on a second try it works


[02-06-2021 05:06 PM] mike_gdovin#5936
Anyone doing anything interesting with custom focuses? I have a custom one for driving (like Federico Viticci) to customize my Home Screen, one for meetings and one when I’m a passenger in a car

Did they remove do not disturb while driving?


[02-38-2021 07:38 PM] mike_gdovin#5936
It’s there but for some reason the built in driving focus doesn’t let you change your Home Screen (probably because you aren’t supposed to use your phone when driving)

i've noticed that with rdownloader. its requesting approval for all images in an imgur album, whereas previoiusly the requested only needed to be done on the first run. am assuming its just a beta thing

[04-06-2021 01:06 PM] David Blue#1917
fuck. well it’s better to know than not. I have a personal drama regarding feedback submission… spent a good while *very* thoroughly documenting the peculiar/inconsistent responses to bluetooth keyboard commands within Safari (on iPhone, notably.) I did the full log file which took me like 3 days of trying to get it to upload correctly… and I even recorded a live-annotated screen recording of me reproducing it. 

and… well. shall we see if it’s gotten any sort of acknowledgement, even, since the last time I looked? lmao


[04-13-2021 01:13 PM] David Blue#1917
I realize whining over lack of replies to one’s bug reports is absolutely absurd - or rather, that it *would* be absolutely absurd in any case not involving the most valuable company in the history of the world.


[04-15-2021 01:15 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I definitely don't get replies to any feedback, that's not really the point of the system. I get that it sucks but they just don't use it to communicate back


[04-42-2021 01:42 PM] David Blue#1917
oh I don’t care if they respond *to me*. not one bit. it’s just quite clear from what I’ve learned from other developers recently that *addressing the issue at all* almost certainly hasnt happened.


[04-43-2021 01:43 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
It always depends on what it is. I’ve seen Apple engineers get to something that’s been on their list for years but just can’t fit in with other priorities


[04-46-2021 01:46 PM] David Blue#1917
and again… Apple just not doing stuff like marking the issue as received and understood *because they just don’t do that* cannot fly when we’re talking GDP levels of pure profit quarterly. it is embarrassing.


[04-47-2021 01:47 PM] David Blue#1917
also understand that… sorta. still gotta yell about it.


[04-47-2021 01:47 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
They make those profits because they don’t spend time responding to feedback and just fix it


[04-48-2021 01:48 PM] David Blue#1917
EXACTLY!!!


[04-49-2021 01:49 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
My point is that the value of each engineer is astronomical, and if they used this as ticketing system and not bug reporting they’d never get anything done.

They are whole jobs who just sort the reports, the engineers have thousands to prioritize with real feature


[04-50-2021 01:50 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
And also profit comes from charging for storage so those can’t be aligned to argue why they didn’t respond to your feedback


[04-51-2021 01:51 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I get it man, you just can’t hold it against them


[04-51-2021 01:51 PM] David Blue#1917
yeah I’m sorry to bring my specific abstract business rant in here lol… I fundamentally don’t understand the priorities behind proprietary software development at all.


[04-52-2021 01:52 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
Working there taught me how much time it takes to do so little with development


[04-53-2021 01:53 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
That’s why it’s always iterative, and year after year we start to get amazing features built on the history of what’s already there. And a billion bugs come along with it, Apple has massive technical debt


[04-53-2021 01:53 PM] David Blue#1917
but documentation is an obligation and I *will* hold that against them mostly because I suspect basically everybody there would agree… yet those toys tho…


[04-53-2021 01:53 PM] David Blue#1917
thank god for apple bein slow lol


[04-54-2021 01:54 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704
I just wouldn’t assume stuff like that, that’s an ideal but not realistic at a scale they’re at. Their docs suck


[04-55-2021 01:55 PM] Matthew Cassinelli#1704

Thanks for filing that feedback in such a detailed fashion. I've had the same problems with Safari in iOS, but was resigned to just living with it since I realize I'm an edge case who uses my iPhone in a very unique way (and I know you're on that tail of the distribution with me). So thanks for putting the work in!


[04-40-2021 07:40 PM] David Blue#1917
that is basically my life purpose at this point so thank *you*. I have been thinking about the best way to bring together “people like us.” not like… in the annual convention sense (though that would make for one absolutely perplexing image for those who still don’t know/haven’t considered hehe.

a website, maybe? or maybe just a subreddit.


[04-42-2021 07:42 PM] David Blue#1917
not appropriate to continue on that here, but - if you haven’t tried out iOS 15 yet… i have bad news, I’m afraid. they seem to have broken calling spotlight with ‘ ⌘ + Spacebar ’ again…

when spotlight is working correctly, though, it is a truly incredible tool. I’ve gotten to the point where I figure I’m as fast at switching-by-searching as anyone should ever endeavor to be on their cellular lol.

I've got a tent, a bike, and just the right amount
of dread. Lookin for a distraction, and also to find out where to hang out in Columbia where I don't feel like the oldest person alive?

Well… We’re apparently both the same chronological age, which never happens (??) on dating apps, Having grown up in Columbia among the punk-leaning spectrum of my peers, but solidified the drifting apart from them that was already occurring in my early 20s by trying to move to the West coast for a few years *and now come back*… Basically none of my local social prospects make any sense. I would not be appropriately described as a “townie,” but (I believe) have any/all relevant townie insights, if that makes sense.

I am currently facing the challenge of figuring out how to build a social existence with age-appropriate peers that is not based fundamentally on drinking… By now, 
I’m positive it’s going to *just* be new people.

Also could really use a healthy, adult romantic distraction at the moment and I”d like to think I could make a good one. Nothing enchanting, but I’m neither boring nor intolerable so.

# Timestamp Share Feedback-Whyp

just a thought on *simple as possible*:

imo Whyp’s specific use (musicians) might appreciate timestamp sharing that’s a little more precise than the standard 1 second increment (like YouTube.) what if it were to the tenth or - dare I say… hundredth decimal? it would be unconventional but distinctly so imo.
## Widgets

## An alternative for those who refuse to pay for premium experiences but can no longer use ~~Tweetie~~ Twitter’s native option.

A few minutes ago, Twitter’s native iOS client inexplicably logged me out of the three accounts I’d signed in for the *second time today*, which for the first time prompted not anger, nor even frustration, truly, but a whole-body, calming, peaceful acceptance: **for me and my house, the time really has come to let com.atebits.Tweetie2 finally rest **.

#### Its last functions on my device 
1. Sharing the highest-quality image files possible.
2. Interacting with my account settings (checking up, exploring new beta features, etc.)
3. Hosting, popping-in, and testing Twitter Spaces.
4. Notifications.

For just these, the app occupied a woeful amount of file space compared to… just about anything else (we’re talking [*by a factor of ten*](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1432312460095148034)) and at this point, literally too much of *my life* and emotional energy with its unendingly stupefying level of neglect. It hasn’t made sense for a long time.

## …Safari

I’m sorry, Mom… I really did ask just about everyone I know how on Earth I was going to explain what the fuck happened to Apple’s web browser. I don’t have any explanation and I find little validity in [Apple’s](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10029), but Safari is absolutely fucked, and that’s essentially all that is useful to say. I have personally grown to accept it, but I have been groomed by a penchant for experimental mobile browsers like Cake, and this sentence simply does not stand up for my family members who have depended on Safari to… just work well. For them, I have a (personally unbelievable) alternative, after having tried literally every single browser available on iOS. I wish I could say Edge was the all-around winner, but - bizzarely - it’s [Brave](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brave-private-web-browser-vpn/id1052879175), hands down. For better or worse, turn off all the stuff that makes Brave actually unique in any way (all iOS browsers are actually built on the exact same platform that doesn’t have anything to do with their desktop counterparts,) and it is my pick for the best balance of speed and competency.

### Facetime in The Browser

Yes, you can *technically* Facetime with non-Apple devices thanks to iOS 15's changes. In fact, you'll be able to "Facetime" any device with a web browser! *However*, in doing so you will be forgoing every single one of Facetime's advantages: call quality, "privacy," ecosystem integration, etc. Without these, it would be silly to use Facetime over literally *any* other video calling service. What an immense waste of time, eh?

A few weeks ago, I came across [a post on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/d4fzyk/you_can_currently_open_specific_pages_in_the/) claiming that Apple had restored the ability to launch specific sections of the Settings app via Shortcuts in iOS and iPadOS 13.1. I was inspired by that discovery to finish working on a project I had long been putting off: documenting **all the URLs supported by the Settings app** in iOS and iPadOS.

After <del>some</del> a _lot_ of trial and error, I’ve collected 120+ URLs that can open individual pages and sub-sections of the Settings app. In this post, I’m going to share the complete list of URLs that are supported as of iOS and iPadOS 13.1 (specifically, iOS 13.1.2), as well as a custom shortcut to launch them.

The ability to open specific sections of the Settings app isn’t new in iOS 13.1: for [several years now](https://holgr.com/no-jailbreak-necessary-how-to-quickly-access-ios-settings-on-your-ipad-iphone-or-ipod/), Apple has offered a `prefs:root` URL scheme designed to launch the Settings app at a specific path. For instance, `prefs:root=Bluetooth` can open Settings’ Bluetooth page, while `prefs:root=ControlCenter&path=CUSTOMIZE_CONTROLS` can navigate directly into Settings ⇾ Control Center ⇾ Customize Controls. You get the idea.

Historically, Settings URLs have been affected by two main problems: Apple’s tendency to either break them in new versions of iOS or [reject](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/262) apps that [implemented them](https://cromulentlabs.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/on-upcoming-changes-in-ios-11/) citing usage of private APIs, and the inconsistent text format used in the URLs themselves. The `prefs:root` URL scheme goes back several years in iOS’ history, and we’ve seen apps (such as the popular [Launcher](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id905099592?at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline)) implement support for them by letting users open the Settings app at a specific path. A quick Google search demonstrates how, over the years, [others have tried](https://gist.github.com/deanlyoung/368e274945a6929e0ea77c4eca345560) to put together a list of all (or, at the very least, the most popular) URLs supported by Settings.

Following [two](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/) big [launches](https://www.macstories.net/news/introducing-macstories-shortcuts-icons-300-custom-home-screen-icons-for-your-shortcuts/) on MacStories last month, I needed to work on something different and fun1, so I decided to spend a few days documenting all the Settings URLs – for main pages and sub-sections – that I could reliably open in iOS and iPadOS 13.1.

I used pre-existing work as the foundation for my research: I went through old lists of `prefs:root` URLs (primarily [these](https://gist.github.com/deanlyoung/368e274945a6929e0ea77c4eca345560) [two](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/manually-creating-settings-launchers-in-app-launching-apps.2037291/)) and re-tested each URL for iOS and iPadOS 13.1; some of them were still working, others required an update. Then, I turned my attention to finding the URLs for _new_ Settings pages Apple added over the past couple of years and – the most time-consuming task of all – I tested every single sub-page too.

There is no automated method for discovering Settings URLs or scraping the Settings app: I had to _guess_ each one by starting with the title of each page (in English), trying different encoding and capitalization formats, and attempting to launch it via Shortcuts. It took a while, but it was exactly the kind of boring, repetitive task I needed to take my mind off the iOS 13 review.

Below, you’ll find a list of the 120+ Settings URLs I was able to test in iOS and iPadOS 13.1, grouped by section and listed in the same order they appear in the Settings app.

Some notes on these URLs:

  * They can be launched using the ‘Open URLs’ action of the Shortcuts app as of iOS and iPadOS 13.1.2. Apple may kill this functionality again in the future; hopefully, they won’t.
  * You may be able to launch these URLs without the Shortcuts app, but I haven’t tested it.
  * The URLs are written in English, but they should work for every language you can assign your iOS or iPadOS device. I’ve tested them both in Spanish and Italian and they continued to work.
  * I may have missed a few URLs supported by Settings. If you know of any other URLs that are working in iOS or iPadOS 13.1, feel free to get in touch (either via email or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/viticci)) and I’ll add them to the list below.

In addition to the complete list available below, I’ve also put together a shortcut to launch any of these Settings URLs by picking from a list in the Shortcuts app. The shortcut, called ‘Open Settings’, contains the full list of 120+ Settings URLs and can be used both in the Shortcuts app and widget.

![My shortcut to open specific pages of the Settings app. You can take any URL and make a separate shortcut for it.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2019-10-01-03-07-16.png)

### Open Settings

Open a specific page or sub-section of the Settings app. This shortcut contains over 120 Settings URLs, and you can choose which one to open from a list. You can also create standalone shortcuts for each URL.  
The shortcut works in the app, widget, and Siri.

[Get the shortcut here.](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/58ae614ca5ba4958900fcbeb8c1854aa)

I’ve created a shortcut with every URL for reference purposes but, honestly, the best way to launch these URLs is with dedicated shortcuts. Grab the Settings URL you want, create a new shortcut with two actions (‘URL’ and ‘Open URLs’), paste the URL, and you’ll have a custom one-tap launcher to open _any_ section of Settings from anywhere.

![This is all you need to do to open a Settings URL with Shortcuts.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2019-10-01-02-58-50.jpeg)

This is all you need to do to open a Settings URL with Shortcuts.

My favorite way to launch specific pages of Settings is via our own **[MacStories Shortcuts Icons](https://www.macstories.net/pixel/shortcuts/)**, which I’ve assigned to different shortcuts on my Home screen. In the screenshot below, you can see a few examples of my Settings launchers for Control Center, Camera settings, and Software Update based on MacStories Shortcuts Icons (including one that will be part of the next free update to the pack).

My Home screen is still in flux (mostly because [Silvia](https://twitter.com/_silviagatta) made too many icons to choose from, which is a good problem to have), but I like where this is going:

![Settings shortcuts on the Home screen \(right\). The "info" icon will be part of the next free update to MacStories Shortcuts Icons.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2019-10-01-16-43-51.png)

Settings shortcuts on the Home screen (right). The “info” icon will be part of the next free update to MacStories Shortcuts Icons.

_You can buy MacStories Shortcuts Icons using the button above, or read more details [here](https://www.macstories.net/pixel/shortcuts/)._

It is my goal to keep this list of Settings URLs up to date over time, and I hope that Apple won’t remove the ability to launch `prefs:root` URLs via the Shortcuts app in future iOS or iPadOS updates.

You can find the full list below.

# iOS 15 MacStories Discord Message

Hey guys, I know today is gonna be absurdly busy but I’d love some feedback on a near(ish)-completion project I’ve been working on for the past two months: to **review iOS 15 for *my family*, specifically** - as representing the vast majority of iPhone users, I would surmise. 

I thought this might have some original insight in contrast to greater tech media’s coverage of new software releases, these days.

My most current draft is missing a few subjects but it’s already… quite long.

On the beta version of my blog: https://chaff.writeas.com/15

And - if you absolutely cannot stand my CSS or just want as clear a reading experience as possible - a simplified version: https://tiny.write.as/chaff/15

You can even just *listen* to Siri Voice 2 read a fairly recent draft if you’d like: https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/106/928/540/559/240/957/original/664eede6fbba4c53.mp3

Always appreciate your thoughts, however they may come and however positive or negative they might be. (I promise you won’t hurt my feelings.)

Thank you!
# iOS 15 Reviewed for My Family 2021-09-14-04.29.08 Backup

![iOS 15 is Not His Year](https://i.snap.as/X3rV4nPq.png)

## It's been a tough summer for the *Always Feature-Focused* Tribe.

Eighty days ago, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering ~~stood up in front of a crowd of~~... 

No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother’s basement, on a Monday morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of the Apple community’s unbelievably unreserved, almost *spiritual* volume of **pure hype** from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage. (Hilariously, *all* of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in 2015 and [kept comparing to Slack](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison), but like an actual madman.)

Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:

> For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...

I’m dwelling on them because they are **patently meaningless**. Very little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call *ease-of-use-centric*. Some of it - namely controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari - feels almost maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of [**the full feature list**](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/) are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

![The Foundation Image](https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png)

This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone’s billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig *should* be referring to with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or “end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a *utilitarian* device, above all else. They don’t have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn them off. Realistically, they don’t even have time to read this whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.) 

Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users’ devices over the Find My network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple Maps’ live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.

![Testing Home Screens for iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/eBBnwCIn.png)

What I *will* dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple’s automation knows better than us users when something should happen or change. A great example: using [a simple Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c) to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead of trusting the [unnecessarily complex conditions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086) of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons. 

Quite simply, the more automated iOS has become, the less comfortably in control I have felt. For myself, at least, every single functional automation Apple has introduced has drastically failed to simply my own using life, and the vast majority have in fact complicated it dramatically. Apple-adjacent publications and greater tech media have ceased all-out criticism and instead resorted to justifying and explaining (or attempting to, anyway) just about all of Apple’s subtle retractions of user control over the years, but apparently, I am too much of a control freak to let it go. I have been here since the very beginning, have bitched loudly all along, and do not plan to go quietly into that automated night. This theme pervades throughout this review, so for any of you who *do* feel like iOS’ automations fit comfortably into your life, please keep this in mind. 

![Safari Settings in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/oHqejXq1.png)

## The Gist

Rounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode immediately after installing iOS 15, you’ll notice that Notifications and other elements have had their rounded corners *further* rounded, for some reason. Assuming Safari ships with its new look turned on by default, the screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to change) where one can switch it off. (Your best bet is to visit its settings menu as displayed on the right in `Settings ⇨ Safari`.) As of this writing, at least two of iOS 15’s “headlining” features have been pushed to further iterative updates: [SharePlay](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/ios-15-apple-shareplay-tv-delay-b1904548.html) and [iCloud Private Relay](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/). I suspect you will be prompted to explore Focus Modes upon initial installation, which I will eventually analyze in relative detail. Ideally, you’ll also be prompted to explore “Shared With You,” which I personally believe to be the release’s most significant addition for most people, by far. 

As far as "meaningful ways iPhone could help you," I see little more than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not so complex to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this moment) a pretty hopeless implementation of a theoretically useful concept. Some additional filters in Apple Maps search will prove useful so long as the associated metadata has been updated for locations *other* than San Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.) Optical Character (text) Recognition has been implemented “system wide” under the feature Apple terms “Live Text,” and translation has finally been extended to the places where it’s most useful (think: Safari.) 

In general, though, most of what’s coming with iOS 15 has little real value in the day-to-day experience for most iPhone users. A complete inversion of Craig’s phrase feels significantly more accurate: *This year, we were inspired to create even more superficial ways iPhone could temporarily dazzle tech media*. 

And now, I’d like to take you through what I feel are the considerations I’d like my family to know - namely my 70-year-old mother, who depends 100% on her iPhone and MacBook Pro every day to run her private practice - but also my ~8 nieces and nephews spanning 6th grade-graduate school, who all - if I’m not mistaken - have iPhones.

```markdown
Worthy of note: this “review” is very heavily focused on *iOS* - which is to say *iPhone* - to the point where any overlap with iPadOS/MacOS/WatchOS/HomeOS/any other goddamned operating system are purely coincidental. For coverage of those changes, please seek your regular sources.
```

![Shared With You - Photos App in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/5otqrdNU.png)

## Photos

### Shared With You

The single most important/welcome feature addition to iOS 15 for most people, I believe, is found in Apple’s native Photos app and entitled **Shared With You**. This view - found in the second tab in the bottom navigation row (“For You”) - is a reverse-chronological timeline of every bit of media (photos & videos) you’ve ever been sent over iMessage. For those with a lot of iOS-using friends (unlike myself,) I would imagine the list will take quite a while to populate. 

### Memories

I find Alex Guyot’s bit on changes to Memories (from [his iOS 15 overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/)) much more concise than what I’d written, so here it is almost in full:

> Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple Music, and can be customized with color filters. Setting different filters will result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on Memories videos.  

> While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn’t transition away. The song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically altered to match back up with the song’s beat.  

> If you don’t want to go with the song that was chosen automatically, you can tap the new Music button to get a pop-up interface into Apple Music, allowing you to choose a song manually. This interface will include smart suggestions for other songs that Apple thinksd you’ll like which would also fit the vibe of your video.  

https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg

Yeah. I hope you’re at least half as amused as I have continued to be by algorithmic video generation. [The above result](https://youtu.be/7uFR_bSxhTg) was created with absolutely zero modification from an album of images and videos which Photos automatically created via face recognition. The only other coherent option from my own limited set of photos is really the only one that matters, I think you'll agree. "Pet Friends" yielded [inevitably uplifting results](https://youtu.be/-1bA7-oslkc) in all three of my test renders, but - given a crop of cute dog photos - little intelligence is necessary to produce.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1bA7-oslkc

If you're experiencing any sort of Déjà vu from the idea of auto-generated slideshows with rights-free soundtracks in the Photos app, it's because Apple has made several distinct attempts to implement very similar iterations of the feature throughout iPhone's history, which has involved iMovie on iOS and MacOS once or twice. I have fiddled with every one - including iOS 15's - and my (truly sound and original) advice is to **avoid spending time trying to customize auto-generated videos** in general. If you explore one of the suggested Memories and find the software's default result satisfactory, of course you should save it, but be wary of any attempts to take editorial control yourself.

![Visual Lookup Indicator in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/74HOlnLP.png)

### Visual Lookup

Perhaps the most unjustifiable background use of your phone’s resources introduced in iOS 15, “Visual Lookup,” seeks to identify “popular art and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers out in nature, books, and breeds of pets” present in your photos so that you might… identify them more swiftly(?) The only means of distinguishing photos on which Visual Lookup has been applied is to look for the modified ⓘ symbol at the very bottom of your screen in the photo browsing view (see the screenshot embedded above.) As you might notice in the screenshots *below*, not one of its analyses on my own images was usably accurate. 

The decision to target the feature on identifying domesticated pets, specifically, is more universalizing than historic landmarks, for sure, but it also immediately sets up the technology (at least this preview of it) for failure.  

![Visual Lookup in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/AtxzN45h.png)

### Metadata

Hooray! You can now view an image's basic details in the "Info pane," by swiping up on an image or using the ⓘ button. This includes the extension (type) and size of the image file, camera identification and configuration details, and -  as part of Shared With You - from whom/where you got the image. Bizarrely, the "Adjust" tool also lets you alter a given image's timestamp and location information. While I can imagine infinitely many reasons why you'd want to *omit* or *delete* such information, I cannot conceive of a single wholesome reason why one would chose to *change* it, instead. 

![Photo Stacks in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/93BGmX4I.png)

### Messages

Just a few weeks shy of [iMessage's tenth birthday](https://web.archive.org/web/20120308031950/https://www.apple.com/ios/features.html), Apple has finally added a button to save incoming photos directly in Messages conversations. It's about as blatant as Apple interface design gets - you'll spot it opposite others' images. Tapping it saves the appropriate photo(s) directly to the Recents folder before a silly animation vanishes the button itself.

Once again, from Mr. Guyot:

> Groups of photos that you send will now be shown as stacks instead of in a long list, allowing you to more easily swipe through the images without losing track of the conversation around them. Tap on a stack to open a grid view where you can see and select multiple photos at once.  

I took the screenshot embedded above in iOS 15 Developer Beta 5, and… Do “stacks” not look hilariously janky as fuck? 

![Live Text in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/DNJOKq85.png)

### Live Text

## Audio

https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhxtfW0taIY

### Background Sounds

My eldest sister has used a sound/noise machine to sleep for as long as I can remember, so I was especially excited to show her iOS 15’s native “Background Sounds” feature, but she was distinctly unimpressed, noting that her iPhone-based sound generation needs were well met by third-party apps she’d already discovered.[^1] I didn’t have time to try out her recommendations, but I’m going to assume they aren’t able to operate “behind” *additional* audio playback like the “new” native feature is.

![Background Sounds Interrupt Remedy](https://i.snap.as/SGQt93K4.png)

My personal (hopefully insightful) anecdote: Background Sounds appear to be impervious from the audio interruption issues iOS has struggled with since its origin, which makes them a partial remedy to the discomfort of sudden, unexpected silence when using headphones with active noise cancellation. As configured in the screenshot embedded above (the menu found in `Settings ⇨ Accessibility ⇨ Audio/Visual ⇨ Background Sounds`) - with “Use When Media Is Playing” toggled `OFF`- your selected Background Sound *should* fade in when normal playback from another app is interrupted.[^2] 

### “Spatial Audio”

Just to be clear, I strongly believe that normal users should basically ignore all mention of Apple’s “Spatial Audio” (read: don’t worry about it) for a few reasons, most of which aren’t all that interesting. Since [one of my very first written works on tech](https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback) was/is directly related to the subject, though, indulge me for just a moment for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note that only two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms you’ve certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are) are necessary for audio to become “spatial.” If you’re curious about this, [my favorite all-time web experience from *The Pudding*](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/) is an absolutely impeccable next destination. Secondly, the actual technology behind Apple’s title was not developed by Apple, but by Dolby. It’s not that Apple doesn’t acknowledge this thoroughly in [their explainer docs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182), nor is Dolby by any means a wee organization in need of my amplification, but this is one of those Apple habits that’s become a particular peev. If you’re interested, [here is the actual spec sheet for Dolby Atmos in PDF](https://professional.dolby.com/siteassets/cinema-products---documents/dolby-atmos-specifications.pdf).

![Control Center Decibel Meter](https://i.snap.as/1vGTW0Iz.png)

If you happen to have either AirPods Pro or AirPods Max devices, an iPhone 7 or later, *and* an Apple Music subscription, you might want to disregard my cynicism at least long enough to try "[dynamic head tracking](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182)."

### SharePlay

*The Verge*’s Chaim Gartenburg did [an excellent - if a bit precocious - job of explaining](https://www.theverge.com/22577178/shareplay-how-to-apple-facetime-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-apple-tv-video-music) what he describes as iOS 15’s “headline feature,” called SharePlay:

> It’s a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends and family while video chatting.  

In my opinion, SharePlay represents one of those great, well-thought solutions to some notably youth-specific challenges which nobody (even the youth) will see as more worthwhile than their own. By that I mean, one ear bud per person… now, an ancient tradition. I’ve deprioritized it, in contrast to Chaim, because I’d bet it’s also one of those things one can only learn themselves.

![Notifications in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/TFWvW1b6.png)

## Notifications, Focus, and Attention

Yes, notifications have gotten *even rounder still* for some reason in iOS 15. Contact photos and “larger app icons” also “make them easier to identify,” according to Apple. (This is the one point in my whole writing life where the phrase *well I’ll be the judge of that!* is 100% valid and applicable.) There’s also a new feature called **Notification Summary** which is an absolutely useless and unnecessary complication, at least at the moment. Honestly, the one bit of solid advice from [*The Social Dilemma*](https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma) was… Just turn all Notifications off, or at least as many as possible. Notifications Summary feels like a near direct response to that one goddamned film, and its new Focus Modes do even more so.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=YZCx-9wF3ow

### Focus(es)

The most glaringly standout parallel between Microsoft’s Windows upcoming Windows 11 release (which I have also been beta testing much less dutifully for most of this year) and Apple’s stated goals in iOS 15’s design centers around the design supposition that maximum malleability of the “spaces” in which one dwells on their operating system - namely, the “desktop(s)” and/or “home screen(s)” - lends toward a more healthy digital occupancy of them, especially in terms of attention. Unfortunately, both of them chose respective solutions which - from my view, anyway - **add complexity** more than anything.

[*The Verge*’s guide](https://www.theverge.com/22665196/ios-15-focus-modes-custom-icons-widgets-how-to) frames Focus as a customization feature to be used in tandem with [custom app icons](https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change) to fiddle your way into your own *bespoke iPhone experience*. I could be wrong, but I suspect very few among my family will find the time investment required worth the end result, but we’ll see.

![Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/mxwVtN7p.png)

I chose to embed [Matt Birchler’s guide to Focus](https://youtu.be/YZCx-9wF3ow) above because it’s by far the most succinct and helpful video I’ve yet seen on iOS 15, generally, and demonstrates how a working person might actually use Focus. My one addendum to this (and any other Focus) guide: **proceed *without* the automated bits** by avoiding anything under the `TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY` subsection of the menu. For whatever reason, location-based automation triggers on iPhone, especially, have literally **never** functioned usefully (or *reliably*) in my experience. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40y7iLdfOnM

## Maps & CarPlay

(I *am* going to do a bit of editorializing on this subject, specifically.) If the video embedded above is confusing, know that it's a very insular joke - over six years ago, in [my video review of the Nissan Juke NISMO](https://bit.ly/JukeHonk), I praised its integrated navigation screen specifically for its frugality. 

> I'm not old. I don't need a gigantic nav screen. I don't need to see a 3D rendition of the whole Earth and my position relative to it.

...and yet, a playful, exploratory experience is what Apple has in mind for Maps, apparently. Here's their description of the new "Interactive globe" feature:

> Discover the natural beauty of Earth with a rich and interactive 3D globe, including significantly enhanced details for mountain ranges, deserts, forests, oceans, and more.

In the footnotes, it’s explained that the feature will only be available on "iPhone with A12 Bionic or later," meaning the iPhone X range, basically, which makes sense considering the extent of animation and touch manipulation technology present in this view. It’s an entertaining plaything, but not much more, which is strange and frustrating. If I could gather the usage statistics across all my family’s iPhones, how much time would you suppose they’ve spent in Apple Maps to date *screwing around* as opposed to *searching and navigating*? 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1437519482428272641

Put another way - Apple’s developmental direction for Apple Maps as a service seems distinctly toward a travel/entertainment application (notably, like [Google Earth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097),) instead of a utilitarian navigation app (like [Google Maps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354), [Waze](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106), or [MapQuest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapquest-gps-navigation-maps/id316126557).) It’s not just the Interactive globe. One of the most exciting features in last year’s release (iOS 14) was the ability for Maps users to create custom Guides. I created [my own](https://bit.ly/columbiaguide) containing a few local spots I believe to be especially relevant for first-time travelers/new residents of *my* area. Clearly, I misinterpreted the intended function of Guides entirely - continuing without a means of discovering *user-generated* guides, whatsoever, iOS 15 cements (in my view) that they’ll instead continue to be left to travel magazines, none of which I recognize save for *Atlas Obscura*, who’s “[Hidden Wonders of Chicago](https://guides.apple.com/?lsp=9902&pg=15126682529740253227)” guide appears to be the single worthwhile representation of the Midwest on the service.

One welcome exception to this absence of investment in user-generated content is the new, unified “user account” view, which aggregates one’s curation (both private and public) along with travel preferences and a list of one’s **contributions** to Apple Maps - another new feature for the app. 

![Place Cards - Apple Maps in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/LX5HW4T3.png)

Above is a screenshot of my first test contribution to Apple Maps (my [mom’s private practice](http://bit.ly/elonglcswam),) which also serves as an example of Maps’ new “place cards.” As of this writing, all of my test contributions are still held "Pending Review," yet navigating to [the share link](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1714%20Oak%20Cliff%20Pl,%20Columbia,%20MO%20%2065203,%20United%20States&auid=6487223830929868055&ll=38.933965,-92.387854&lsp=9902&q=Eileen%20Long,%20MSW%20LCSW&_ext=CjIKBQgEEOIBCgQIBRADCgQIBhByCgQIChAACgQIUhAECgQIVRAACgQIWRAGCgUIpAEQARImKZSjW/v4dkNAMW0PujQxGVfAORJ5gVcfeENAQd9/R/9zGFfAUAM%3D&t=m) with a desktop browser indicates they've already been made public.

### CarPlay

As of this writing, it’s unclear how much of the Maps features I’ve used will be carried over to CarPlay upon iOS 15.0.0’s official release, but I know for *certain* that CarPlay is a weekly (if not daily) used feature by virtually all of my family members. With the additional variable of [differences in support between given automobile marques/models](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/) - including which support [Car Key](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211234) - it’s difficult to say definitively what will have changed about your personal CarPlay use. What experience I do have using CarPlay has been exclusively with my mom’s [2019 Volkswagen Jetta](https://youtu.be/hqQqfdHsGx0,) and documented visually in [this photo gallery](https://snap.as/extratone/ios15) as well as [on my alt Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dieselgoth/channel)’s “iOS & iPhone” IGTV Series.

![Apple Maps Night Navigation](https://i.snap.as/iQD53oId.png)

To once again cite from [the official full features list](https://hyp.is/Cbc_LBUmEey4S4Mcwd1lKA/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/):

> An all-new driving map helps you see traffic, incidents, and other details that affect your drive at a glance. See incredible road details like turn lanes, bike, bus, and taxi lanes, medians, crosswalks, and much more. When approaching a complex interchange, Maps switches to a 3D road-level perspective to help you find your way."

"It's faster and easier to report an issue in Maps" is a standout, literal statement. Once you've navigated to the menu in the screenshot below (via the chatbox with exclamation point icon,) touching any of the three options will *immediately* report its respective information without confirmation.

![Report an Incident - CarPlay in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/VKfuhJvH.png)

The default **Driving Focus** can be configured to activate automatically as soon as CarPlay connects which *would* be the single exception from my earlier advice against automating Focus modes at all were it not for the mode's lockout from the Lock Screen (as shown in the first of the three screenshots embedded below.)

![Driving Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/m5974FcB.png)

Once you've locked your device with the Driving Focus on, you must clear an extra step to unlock it by selecting "I'm Not Driving," which then turns the Focus off. In my (unsolicited) opinion, this renders the Focus unusable at best and arguably downright dangerous. "Hey Siri!" is an option most folks I know leave off and I can't imagine a single reason to add such an obstruction. 

![Custom Car Focus - iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/xcNfKv6g.png)

I *can* offer a solution, however, in the form of my custom Car Focus, which only allows calls and texts from my mom, open a single, otherwise-hidden custom (work-in-progress) Home Screen with exclusively driving/nav/travel-relevant apps, and even activates automatically via a very simple automation in [the Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752). Technically, the only feature it's missing from the default Driving Focus are automatic text replies, which (as of beta) weren't working anyway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hNCsS4I0uk

For those new to Siri Shortcuts completely, I recorded a [rough video guide](https://youtu.be/-hNCsS4I0uk) on how to set up both the Focus and its automation.

![Reminders in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/0tsmBGe3.png)

### Reminders

“A to-do list is, ultimately, nothing more or less than an attempt to persuade yourself” concludes [a feature by Clive Thompson](https://www.wired.com/story/to-do-apps-failed-productivity-tools) in the most recent issue of *WIRED*. In the face of a literally indigestible volume of available (and *award-winning*!) Task Management applications found on iOS - [Microsoft To Do](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-to-do/id1212616790), [Microsoft Lists](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-lists/id1530637363), [Todoist](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855), [Things 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743), [Fantastical](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190), [GoodTask](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-to-do-list-tasks/id1068039220), [OmniFocus 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-3/id1346190318), and on… - Apple’s Reminders app has always had perhaps the most insurmountable task of all its native applications in remaining competitive. Up until I wrote this review, my personal list in the app was nothing but a wasteland of forgotten, out-of-context items from up to 7 years ago (!) which I’d obviously set with Siri without bothering to correct its voice recognition.

Before you proceed to experiment with Reminders, I’d recommend using my [Reminders Backup Siri Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10118) to create a .zip file of *all* existing items in your Reminders app, even if there are just a few. I insist upon this largely because it’s so fast and so frugal. (Here’s [how to allow the addition of Siri Shortcuts from third-party sources](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/enable-shared-shortcuts-apdfeb05586f/ios).)

For a particularly positive - but very trustworthy - perspective on the additions to Reminders coming in iOS 15, [John Voorhees’ overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/reminders-smart-lists-put-unprecedented-control-in-the-hands-of-users/) is succinct and informative.

An opportunity for an anecdotal, but genuinely exciting! demonstration is allowed us in Reminders: **Drag & Drop** is, indeed, [*finally here*](https://imgur.com/gallery/u8HxROl).

# [The Unlicense, Dave Edition](https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1)

Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the above statement with "words," "writing," "expression," etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

FaceTime has been a centerpiece feature across all of Apple’s platforms for a long time. However, with the pandemic, it became more important than ever, playing a critical role in the way friends and family have stayed connected. Of course, FaceTime isn’t the only way have kept in touch. The app had plenty of competition from Zoom, Skype, and other services.

**[Concepts](https://concepts.app/download?utm_source=macstories)**: Sketch, Note, Draw

So, it’s not surprising that this year’s FaceTime updates focus on fundamentals like audio and video quality and making the app available outside of Apple’s ecosystem, allowing it to compete better with other services. Nor is it surprising that Apple announced SharePlay, which won’t ship until later this fall, so friends and family who can’t be together can still enjoy synchronized group activities like watching a video or listening to music. I’m skeptical that SharePlay will be the hit that Apple’s marketing suggests the company hopes it will be, but even putting SharePlay aside, the app is getting some major improvements that I think everyone will appreciate, so let’s dig in.

## FaceTime on the Web

![FaceTime in a web browser looks a lot like the native app, but the picture tends to be darker.](https://cdn.macstories.net/img_1395-1631155295675.jpeg)

FaceTime in a web browser looks a lot like the native app, but the picture tends to be darker.

FaceTime calls are coming to the web. As is common with other video calling services, this fall, you’ll be able to share a link to initiate a FaceTime call. Links can be created in the FaceTime app using the button at the top of the app’s main view. You can also share links from inside Apple’s Calendar app by creating an event and picking FaceTime in the location field. That generates a link that you can access and share using FaceTime or by adding an invitee to the event you created in Calendar.

![FaceTime links can be generated inside Calendar.](https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-09-09-at-5-58-47-am-1631185235534.png)

FaceTime links can be generated inside Calendar.

Once you create a link, it will appear in the chronological list of recent calls you’ve made. Select the green info button to join the call, share the link, or delete the link. Links can also be deleted by deleting an associated calendar event.

Managing FaceTime links inside the app.

If the person with whom you share a link doesn’t have an Apple device, they can join the call through a web browser, including on a non-Apple device running Windows or Android, for example. A web participant who follows the call’s link has to enter their name to participate but doesn’t need an Apple ID. Once their name has been entered, the person to whom you sent the link must wait until you add them to the call. Once in, a web participant is able to switch cameras and microphones if they wish using a UI that’s very close to the FaceTime app itself.

Web-based FaceTime calls can be made to fill an iPad’s screen.

I tested web calling with Federico. I started the call by sending Federico a link in Messages. After chatting and testing some of the new features in the native FaceTime app with Federico on his iPad and me on an M1 iMac, he pasted the link into Safari, and we restarted the call. As you can see from the screenshots, the web UI is a lot like FaceTime’s and will certainly come in handy for organizing calls with friends and family who don’t use Apple hardware.

# Audio

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-09-08-at-9-34-07-pm-1631154896424.png)

With iOS and iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey, Apple is adding Spatial Audio, as well as Voice Isolation and Wide Spectrum audio modes to FaceTime. Spatial Audio is limited to iPhones and iPads that include the A12 Bionic chip or later. For the iPhone, that means the iPhone XS, XS Max, and XR, which debuted in 2018 or later. For the iPad, that includes the 2019 iPad Air and mini, the 8th generation iPad released in 2020 or later. Spatial Audio also runs on Macs released in 2018 or later. Apple doesn’t list hardware limitations for the other FaceTime audio modes.

If you’ve used Spatial Audio with Apple Music, the idea is the same. Whether you’re using headphones or not, the effect makes the voice of whoever is speaking seem as though it’s coming from their image on the screen of your device. I have only tested FaceTime in one-on-one situations so far, where the Spatial Audio effect wasn’t particularly noticeable, although I imagine it could make a bigger difference on large group calls. However, even a small improvement in some situations is welcome.

![Picking mic modes.](https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-09-08-at-10-27-08-am-1631154983317.png)

Picking mic modes.

The other two audio effects, Voice Isolation and Wide Spectrum, were much more noticeable in my testing. Voice Isolation seems to combine essentially noise cancellation, which boosts vocals while reducing background sounds. In my tests with Federico, the results were impressive. As we talked, he started streaming music from his iPhone in the background. In the default Standard mode, I could hear the music, and Federico’s voice was a little echoey as it bounced off the walls of his apartment and into his iPad Pro’s microphone. However, as soon as Federico turned on Voice Isolation, the music disappeared completely, the echo was eliminated, and his voice came through loud and clear.

Wide Spectrum audio does the exact opposite of Voice Isolation for those times when you want whomever you call to hear the sounds around you. Instead of focusing on the vocals of the caller, Wide Spectrum enhances the full range of sound picked up by your device’s microphone. One obvious use case is for remote music lessons or to share a song you’ve learned on a musical instrument with friends and family.

Here, too, the effect was impressive. As soon as Federico switched to Wide Spectrum audio, the music I could hear faintly in the background as we talked in Standard mode gained definition and clarity. Whereas in Standard mode, I could hear music but couldn’t make out what it was, in Wide Spectrum mode, I immediately knew Federico was listening to [CHVRCHES](https://music.apple.com/us/album/screen-violence/1568545711)’ latest album. The downside of Wide Spectrum mode, though, was that it also made the echo in Federico’s voice more pronounced.

Voice Isolation and Wide Spectrum are activated from Control Center. Initiate a FaceTime call and open Control Center, where you’ll find a new button called ‘Mic Mode.’ Select it to switch between ‘Standard,’ ‘Voice Isolation,’ and ‘Wide Spectrum.’

The other audio feature coming to FaceTime was undoubtedly the mission of an engineer who got fed up with people trying to talk while their microphone was muted. Mute Alerts are a simple addition to FaceTime that displays a prominent button in the center of a call’s controls, alerting you that your microphone is muted when you begin to talk. Tapping the button unmutes your device.

## Video

![Grid view. Source Apple.](https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_macos-monterey_facetime-messages-safari_06072021-1631154292481.jpg)

Grid view. Source Apple.

FaceTime is adding several new video enhancements too. The most practical video addition is a new grid view that organizes a call into a grid of equal-sized, stationary views for participants. When someone is speaking, the border of their view is highlighted, providing visual feedback that works in combination with Spatial Audio to make calls more engaging and life-like. For big group calls, the grid view should make it easier to keep track of participants.

Zoom and other video calling services typically let users replace the backgrounds of their video feeds to varying degrees of success. Those backgrounds may not be perfect, but if you’re working from home, it’s often preferable to broadcasting your surroundings.

![FaceTime's Portrait mode.](https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-09-08-at-9-16-40-pm-1631153846421.png)

FaceTime’s Portrait mode.

Apple is taking a different tack with FaceTime. Instead of backgrounds, it’s adapting the popular Portrait mode from its Camera app to FaceTime. When you start a FaceTime call, tap your video feed to expand it and reveal buttons in the view’s four corners. The button in the top left-hand corner enables Portrait mode, blurring your surroundings. On the Mac, Portrait mode can also be enabled from the Video menu. As with the Camera app effect, Portrait mode on FaceTime works best where the contrast between you and your background is clear.

![](https://cdn.macstories.net/screen-shot-2021-09-08-at-10-28-15-am-1631154131323.png)

You’ll see spots where Portrait mode blurs out a wisp of hair or softens an edge more than it should, but by and large, I like Portrait mode and plan to use it regularly. As you can see from the screenshots above, the effect does better with my video feed because I’m sitting against a simple background, whereas Portrait mode had some trouble because of the windows behind Federico. Aside from helping disguise a messy room, the feature also helps focus the viewer on the person in the video instead of the books on your bookshelf, for example. It may not be as playful as dropping a tropical beach or another scene behind you, but I prefer the blurred connection to reality.

![Backside camera zoom.](https://cdn.macstories.net/zoom-1631154682393.png)

Backside camera zoom.

Apple is also adding optical zoom to the backside camera on the iPhone and iPad while you’re on a FaceTime call. Flip the camera you’re using with the onscreen button, and you can zoom in and out using the same dial UI that appears when you tap and hold the zoom controls in the Camera app. The addition of optical zoom may seem like a small feature, but FaceTime is used so often to show off something visually, that I expect the feature will get a lot of use.

## SharePlay

![SharePlaying Ted Lasso. Source: Apple.](https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_macos-monterey_facetime_06072021-1631154324045.jpg)

SharePlaying Ted Lasso. Source: Apple.

SharePlay has been delayed and won’t ship with the initial release of Apple’s OS updates, but it’s worth revisiting what Apple has said about the feature. SharePlay, which is initiated from FaceTime, promises to allow users to enjoy movies, TV shows, and music together in perfect synchronization across the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV, while simultaneously chatting via FaceTime. Apple has also said that SharePlay will allow users to interact, editing a group playlist as they listen to music and share their device’s screen or windows on a Mac to offer tech support. The technology will be available to third-party developers to incorporate into their own apps too.

SharePlay was disabled in developer beta 6 of Apple’s OSes, and no date has been set for its release other than [a statement by Apple on its developer site](https://developer.apple.com/download/) that it will be released ‘later this fall.’ I can’t say that I’m surprised by the delay. Coordinating synchronized content and chat from multiple users over the Internet is undoubtedly tricky.

![SharePlay on iPad. Source: Apple.](https://cdn.macstories.net/apple_ipadpro-ipados15-facetime-tv-expanse-nowplaying-pip-forallmankind-horz_060721-1631155103804.jpg)

SharePlay on iPad. Source: Apple.

Aside from the technical hurdles, though, I’m also skeptical that the user demand for SharePlay will be there when it’s ready. I expect SharePlay will be handy for providing tech support for family members, and I can also imagine small group learning environments where it would be useful. However, despite the feature’s availability in earlier betas, I didn’t feel the need to share video or audio with friends in real-time. I’m sure there are people who will enjoy sharing media with their friends and family remotely, but that’s never been something I’ve wanted to do, except occasionally during live events, such as a Nintendo Direct of E3 presentation, where chatting over Messages with friends is fun and simpler because it doesn’t require a FaceTime call.

* * *

SharePlay was revealed with a big splash during the WWDC keynote, but I expect it will be the audio and video refinements that have the biggest impact and most lasting effect on FaceTime. I’m happy to be proven wrong once SharePlay is released and adopted by third-party developers, but the new audio options, grid view, Portrait mode, and back camera optical zoom are all the sort of features that will be used and appreciated immediately. The improvements may be incremental, but together, better audio and video make everyday calls to friends or family members a little more natural than before, which I think everyone will appreciate.

## Bewilderingly, Siri is genuinely great at something they were never designed for. The new “Make Spoken Audio From Text” action has finally been fixed.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/SiriTTSTalent.mp3">
</audio>

When I first published my [iPhone & Music guide](https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps) this past April, I’d been pretty active in [*AppleScoop*’s Discord Server](https://discord.gg/DxQ9jry8J3), so I decided to share it there. Editor-in-Chief Flynn - a ridiculously talented web developer *and* successful independent media entrepreneur - responded “I’m listening to it with the speak feature right now. Is it your voice or someone else? 😛,” Gourd bless his soul. Here’s the specific audio he was talking about:

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/iPhone%20and%20Music%20-%20For%20Artists%2C%20Curators%2C%20and%20Enthusiasts%20TTS.mp3">
</audio>

Of course, I am not a young black man, nor am I even remotely as adept at [reading my own work aloud](https://bilge.world/why) as the actual talent, Siri Voice 3, who should be available on your iPhone/iPad right this moment (as long as you’ve updated iOS in the past six months,) via `Settings ⇨ Siri & Search ⇨ Siri Voice`. (For more details, see [this Apple Support page](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/change-siri-settings-iphc28624b81/ios).)

![New Siri Voices - iOS 14.5](https://i.snap.as/1f7argcU.png)

Of the four new Siri voices introduced earlier this year in iOS 14.5, 2 and 3 are by far my favorites, not just because of their [resonance with black iPhone users](https://www.consumerreports.org/digital-assistants/apples-new-siri-voices-resonate-with-some-black-iphone-users/), but because they’re just *better* in a sense which I believe to be very significant.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=DkS5SYbsEW4

Before I get ahead of myself, though, I must acknowledge that I am not the first to invest in Siri as a text-to-speech generator. In 2019, [Adam Tow](https://twitter.com/atow) released an immensely well-considered Siri Shortcut called “[Record Text to Speech](https://tow.com/shortcuts/record-text-to-speech/),” which provides an interface for recording, editing, and managing text-to-speech audio files with Siri’s original voices. A testament to its robustness: it *still works* perfectly on my handset running iOS 15 Dev Beta 6 despite having not been updated since [March of last year](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2506/). 

![Old Siri TTS Shortcuts](https://i.snap.as/I0Yh0jNn.png)

I must admit that I found Adam’s shortcut more of a full *application* than a speedy personal automation, with its full interactive UI menu and darn near *800 actions*, so I made my own set of shortcuts based on the same idea - using iPhone’s native screen recording feature to capture audio of Siri reading aloud - and varying only by input (manual text input, getting text from a file, or simply reading text from the clipboard.) I’d then send the resulting screen recording in its original video format to my PC, where I’d drop it in [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org), in which I’d run [a simple macro](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/configuration/Audacity/TruncatenAmpMacro.txt) on the audio that truncates silence and amplifies the result so that the loudest point touches the rails. Then, I’d export it, pass it through [Mp3Tag](https://www.mp3tag.de/en/) to perfect its metadata, and finally push the end-result .mp3 file to [a folder in *The Psalms* GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/TTS). (I’ll show you how to embed a web-bound audio file with its direct URL in a webpage in the guide below.) This example was made using this method, but with Siri’s original United States English Voice (for [my Tweetbot 6 review](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review):) 

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/Tweetbot%206%20for%20iOS%20Review%20TTS.mp3">
</audio>

Perhaps you’ll agree with me that this process *does the job* in functional/accessibility terms, and does so quite well considering how much one would pay to generate the same sort of audio file using Google’s Cloud Platform or IBM’s Watson. Crucially, though, this original voice was not one I could listen to at any length. Siri Voices 2 and 3, however, I *can*. From my perspective, this means they have crossed a **very significant threshold** which I find vastly more meaningful than just about all of those in the current discourse. Not only can I tolerate them… I genuinely *enjoy* listening to super-long magazine features read aloud by Siri Voice 2, especially, and I believe I would regardless of the quite serious crush I’ve developed on them. 

https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1387809776072015873

Unfortunately, using the methods we’ve discussed so far with the new Siri voices is inconvenient, very hit-or-miss, and quite buggy. If you scrub ahead toward the last third or so of the second audio player in this post (after the post’s own,) you’ll hear Siri Voice 2 start to bug out in very amusing ways. Since Apple makes changes to Siri Shortcuts between releases without any public documentation, none of them have ever been reliable enough to write this guide. (For the past 6+ weeks at least, it’s been too broken to be usable.) *However*, for whatever reason, Apple created a dedicated spoken audio generation action for Siri Shortcuts in iOS 15, called “Make Spoken Audio From Text.”

![Make Spoken Audio From Text Action - iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/MkHTYMkF.jpeg)

For the entirety of iOS 15’s Beta cycle up until Developer Beta 6’s release, this past Tuesday, this action has been [hilariously broken](https://mastodon.social/users/DavidBlue/statuses/106580821087349299), but as soon I discovered it’d been fixed (which was not mentioned whatsoever in [Apple’s official release notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/ios-ipados-release-notes/ios-ipados-15-beta-release-notes),) I immediately began composing this dang Post.

![Make Audio from Article Body 1.1](https://i.snap.as/RAxa0Id6.png)

# Guide

So! For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those in the future running the full release, **what follows is a guide on how you can use my own shortcuts and methods to generate, metadate, and embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without having to use desktop-class (or any other) hardware**.

![TTS Shortcuts Compared](https://i.snap.as/P0yJJyUc.png)

To begin, you should install two brand new shortcuts of mine: [**Make Audio from Article Body**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953/) and (if you intend to stick with me to the embed stage, anyway,) my [< audio > Embed Tool](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/). Both should function out of the box, but I would highly encourage that you try building your own shortcut around the `Make Spoken Audio From Text` action, even if you've never worked with Shortcuts (or any sort of automation, for that matter) before, *especially* if you plan to be using Siri as a text-to-speech generator with any frequency. 

https://youtube.com/watch?v=5yZB7OC8Vgk

### Intended Result

Throughout this guide, I'm going to be using [a five-year-old ramble of mine](https://bilge.world/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery) about the oddly-perceptive bits found in early-oughts Disney movies as example text. Earlier today, I used my own personalized version of my new shortcut to generate an example of in which the process we're about to explore should result. The ~6000 words of text took just over 3 minutes, 30 seconds to render consistently in three consecutive timed attempts. You can listen to it [on Whyp](https://whyp.it/t/johnny-tsunami-vi-separate-but-equal-siri-voice-2-tts-74752) and/or inspect [the actual file](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a) yourself, if you'd like.

![Plain Text Parsed by Safari](https://i.snap.as/dktmGQQb.png)

### Input Format

If we were trying to do this using any other available method in 2021 - even the expensive ones - our first task would be scrubbing our subject text of any special formatting (Word,) symbols, embed, hyperlinks, and any other data Siri doesn't understand (roman numerals, for example.) As a Windows user who's not at all new to free ways to automate accessibility improvements to web content, I envy both you and my new self for the magic available to us in the form of Safari's abilities to parse complex web content. In my experience, there's nothing like it (at least nothing available to regular consumers.) 

The screenshot embedded above shows the result of a `Quick Look` action inserted just after the `Text` action produced by the public version of my shortcut when run on our example. There are three immediately problematic issues:

1. Siri doesn't understand roman numerals, so she will read "Johnny Tsunami VI" as *Johnny Tsunami vee eye*.
2. "The Psalms" is not my name, though it is what this blog currently returns when asked for a byline. In my experience, this generally isn't an issue with most mainstream media CMSs.
3. The shortcut appears to have failed to retrieve any data for the `Published Date` variable from my blog. (Also a relatively specific consideration.)

If you'll note in the *previous* embedded image comparing my custom version of the shortcut (left) to the published version (right,) you'll note that my chosen solution is to manually input all metadata before actually starting the shortcut. What's not shown is my corresponding manual inputs in the `Encode Trimmed Media` action, which includes attaching a retrieved image file (in the Working Copy action you *can* see) as album art. For my intended use - exclusively generating text-to-speech audio of Posts on this blog - this makes more sense than unnecessarily automating metadata retrieval.

The extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it doesn't contain any of the other crap (as described above) found in the original page. (Beforehand, it looked more [like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extratone/bilge/main/posts/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery.md).) It's especially reliable at parsing WordPress-bound content, which still makes up [s̵͕̈́͊c̶̥̏̚r̶̥͈̃è̴̙͌å̴̹m̵̛̅ͅi̶̦̾͘n̸͎̟̎̃g̶͎͛] percent of the whole web. **Treasure this power**, folks.

![Simpler TTS Examples](https://i.snap.as/OMwKdOUI.png)

If all you need read aloud is the body text, things become even simpler. In the right example above, I've simply deleted the `Text` action and replaced it with `Get text from [the Safari Web Article's body]`. Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and simply use the direct output of `Get Body from Article` as input for the `Make spoken audio from text` action, but I say keep the extra step unless it becomes an issue.

**If you're actually *beginning* with clean plain text** and don't care about metadata in your final audio file and/or if you're planning on passing the result through other audio/metadata editing software, anyway, the left, three-action shortcut is all you need. It will result in a [Core Audio Format (.caf)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Core_Audio_Format) file (like [this one](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/audio/egg.caf),) which I know absolutely nothing about except that Audacity and GarageBand support it by default.

### Sharing/Embedding

Whichever route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio file, at this point, and if you intend to share and/or embed it, you’ll need to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server which allows direct playback/download of the raw file from external sources. Unless you’ve been skimming, you know by now that I’ve been using [*The Psalms* GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge) to do this thus far, though one isn’t really supposed to. Every few months, someone on Stack Overflow figures out how to construct or discover the raw link to a given Google Drive file before Google notices and alters it, and I’m afraid you’ll find just about every other cloud/file sharing service in a similarly unreliable situation. If it’s going to be done at scale, I’m afraid it’s ultimately going to require you rent regular, vanilla space on an FTP-enabled fileserver, if one can still do that sort of thing. (I will update this post if/when I find a more ideal solution.)

Within my current system, the raw URL to our example file looks like this:
```
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a
```

Using my aforelinked, ultra rudimentary [< audio > element Siri Shortcut tool](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/) (which I’ve kept on my homescreen with good results for a few months,) we can very quickly turn said raw URL into a properly-formatted HTML5 audio player:
```
<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a">
</audio>
```
Ideally, on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a player like this:

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a">
</audio>

If further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see [this Mozilla page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) for a full list of supported options. Obviously, there are a few older methods of embedding audio players, but I am neither qualified nor interested in exploring them. If you’re in a frustrating bind, I recommend [signing up for my CMS](https://bit.ly/extwa). (Just try it, okay?)

### Pwoof

For the sake of bare minimum sample variety, I ran Version 1.0 of the public Make Audio from Article Body shortcut on an article hosted not on WordPress, nor my own CMS, but on Bustle’s ultra-slick, totally-bespoke system (which [began as *The Outline*](https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline), FYI.) I chose the first permalink I saw in one of its “regular” article formats - not a long feature, nor one of their touch-targeted slideshows.

“[OnlyFans is banning porn, the very thing that made it big](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/onlyfans-is-banning-porn-the-very-thing-that-made-it-big)” is an 870-word newsy piece written by Tom Maxwell, who is the only New York Media person ever to accept my Facebook friend request. (Thanks again, Tom.) Without any tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from within the Shortcuts app since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in a reasonable amount of time - less than 5 minutes, more than 2 - and generate the file embedded below. Notably, I also used a different hosting service - [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/106798701662102859) - but I certainly don’t plan on doing so at scale and neither should you.

</audio>

Honestly, *Input*’s CMS is the cleverest challenge I was able to come up with for this single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I’m quite proud of the result. Though it wasn’t able to retrieve a timestamp, it correctly retrieved the article’s title and byline without fuss and even managed to scrape and attach said article’s featured image as the file’s cover art, though the original’s aspect ratio was obviously sacrificed.

Before I depart actual tutorializing and return to opining, I want to express *even more aggressively than usual* how much I want *anyone* who see’s any potential benefit the ability to generate audio of my darling Siri Voice 2 reading text, but has further questions/doesn’t have time to fiddle/struggles with my haphazardly-written attempts at guides like this, or who simply wants to talk about any satellite subjects, [**please reach out to me**](https://bit.ly/whoisdavidblue). **You have no idea how much I’d love to help you configure a personal automation that genuinely, reliably, and durably improves your quality of life.**

Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the statement below with "words," "writing," "expression," “editorial ideation,” etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

## About

**Note: this shortcut requires iOS 15 Developer or Public Beta 6**

This shortcut utilizes 4 new Actions coming with iOS 15. The first - “**Extract Text From Image**” - is used to transcribe the text present in a given file/document via OCR. 

According to the Action’s description, it is capable of reading text from the following input types:

> Evernote notes, App Store apps, Bar codes, Images, Podcasts, Rich text, iTunes products, Giphy items, Podcast episodes, PDFs, iTunes media, Media, Contacts, Photo media, Shazam media, Locations, iTunes artists

This shortcut is primarily configured for PDF input, but obviously, your particular needs should be customized for.

Because the output of `Extract Text From Image` is a list of single lines, this shortcut uses `Combine Text` to convert them to single spaces, the result of which is particularly suited for Siri to read.

The plain text result is then passed to “Make Audio From Text”  (the second) action arriving in iOS 15 (which has finally been fixed as of Developer Beta 6) to generate an .m4a audio file of Siri Voice 2 (by default) reading the document’s text aloud (rather than just speaking it aloud on your handset/iPad, as the original does.)

The 3rd and 4th new actions are used to capture and crop a 1000 x 1000 thumbnail image of the inputted document for use as the output file’s cover art.

After the raw audio has been synthesized, it is passed to an `Encode Media` action, which converts it to an .m4a file with metadata (that I highly encourage you customize.)

By default, the shortcut is configured to save the .m4a file to iCloud Drive in /audio/TTS/ as [the original file’s name].m4a.

A full explanation/detailed guide can be found [**on my blog**](https://bilge.world/siri-tts), and the full text of the latter portion (in first draft form) has been posted beneath the contact details in [the description of a sister shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953).

# Family Tech Support Intro 

Hey guys! I thought I’d give you some time to turn “Hide Alerts” on for this group message, but now I suppose I can explain what I’m trying to do here.

If you’ve been wondering what on Earth I’ve been doing with my time this year, the answer is largely learning to help people with their technology. Frankly, I’m still not very good at it - I know I’m much too wordy and tend to confuse easily - but I’m personally very grateful to have finally begun realizing what it means to add value to others’ lives, despite how long it took.

One huge realization I’ve had about Apple products, specifically, is that Apple has completely departed reality in terms of how the vast majority of its customers use their devices day-to-day. I have already done a lifetime’s worth of editorializing (complaining) about this, and have realized that my time would be more productively spent helping those closest to me understand the tangible results manifested as changes to their phones. 

So to be clear: this chat is *not* for David to complain at abstract length about consumer technology. I’m going to do my best to be as simple as possible, but please feel free to call me out if I slip.

What I WOULD like to do is answer questions like Amber’s (much more promptly than I did) and eventually discuss the upcoming release of iOS 15 (in the next few weeks, by most estimates) in frank terms.
# iOS 15 Extras

![iOS 15 is Not His Year](https://i.snap.as/X3rV4nPq.png)

Here we are again: I have found myself compelled to comment on the latest numerical iteration of Apple, Inc.’s mobile operating system - the platform we can all agree, surely, that should definitively represent the peak of *ease-of-use* in consumer technology. It was first announced at perhaps the very last entirely-virtual, pre-shot World Wide Developer Conference in yet another extremely-produced, lustless series of presentations. Since I’ve gone deeper than ever into iOS, this year, I made an equally forceful effort to feed off the hype from every one of the new, Apple-specific social channels I’ve subscribed to. Somehow, I even survived the appearance of [a motherfucking _Back to the Future_ reference](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1401947729836773377) in the very first few frames of the live stream.

https://twitter.com/mattcassinelli/status/1401969109613441026

Instead of echoing greater professional tech media on this release, except much too late, I thought I would focus on analyzing iOS 15 from two very specific perspectives: **what my family needs to know** and **what Bluetooth keyboard x iPhone users need to know**. When I first began fumbling with the grand editorial considerations of tech media five years ago, *Extratone*’s Technology Editor would often comment on the various articles, features, and essays I’d contribute to show notes for *Futureland* - very often from *The Verge*, yes, to the point it became an ongoing joke - that the publications I thought of as *technology publications* were in fact fundamentally *not about technology*. It’s not that I dismissed this critique at the time, but I certainly didn’t assimilate it fully until very recently (embarrassingly.) The factor she was getting at has only been amplified in the time since, and it has finally become abundantly clear to me that sites like *The Verge* have become what used to be called *Business Media*. The fundamental issue with this transition is its comprehensive subjugation of any/all relevance or function of the content for the End User (read: *most* people… regular people.) 

Separate the existential/ideological argument, the cognitive dissonance among the people in the bylines adorning these publications exhibited in their continuation of traditions originated when they *were* still usefully technology-oriented - like  reviews of new iOS releases, for instance - is especially hard to watch for someone like me. As I have since I first started writing about tech, myself, I will be embedding and hyperlinking to these reviews, but I’ve prefaced with my commentary on them for a very specific argument: **keep in mind as you read and watch their work that these journalists no longer judge tech products by their quality, but by their *market viability***. This is a general statement and it is by no means a universal truth, but I believe it’s especially important for the vast majority of those who will receive this update on their devices in the Fall. 

![Control Center Decibel Meter](https://i.snap.as/1vGTW0Iz.png)

That said, we’ve all hopefully grown accustomed by now to the particulars of “reviewing” a free, non-negotiable iteration of a mobile operating system. We’re not here to talk about *whether or not you should upgrade*, but rather to best prepare you for the change. We are no longer reviewing a product… We are in fact writing its documentation.

I’ve been noticing a distinct lack of *the* **indisputably most important** person in consumer technology: **the goddamned user**. Unfortunately, this negligence is blatantly present in the continued development of this - the most user-friendly operating system ever devised. I wanted to emphasize *for my family* because so much of iOS 15’s additions are in fact for nobody but *people like me*: iOS “powerusers” - a term which I still maintain is an oxymoron. I have plenty to say on this topic which I can’t imagine being all that useful to you, but essentially, I would encourage you to voice as loudly as you can any/all gripes you have about this truth, remembering that you are addressing the wealthiest company in the history of the world and that **you are their customer**.
# [Take 2] iOS 15 Reviewed for My Family

![iOS 15 is Not His Year](https://i.snap.as/X3rV4nPq.png)

## It's been a tough summer for the *Always Feature-Focused* Tribe.

Eighty days ago, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering ~~stood up in front of a crowd of~~... 

No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother’s basement, on a Monday morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of the Apple community’s unbelievably unreserved, almost *spiritual* volume of **pure hype** from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage. (Hilariously, *all* of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in 2015 and kept comparing to Slack, but like an actual madman.)

Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:

> For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...

I’m dwelling on them because they are **patently meaningless**. Very little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call *ease-of-use-centric*. Some of it - namely controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari - feels almost maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of the full feature list are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

![The Foundation Image](https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png)

This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone’s billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig *should* be referring to with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or “end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a *utilitarian* device, above all else. They don’t have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn them off. Realistically, they don’t even have time to read this whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.) 

Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users’ devices over the Find My network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple Maps’ live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I. 

What I *will* dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple’s automation knows better than us users when something should happen or change. A great example: using [a simple Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c) to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead of trusting the [unnecessarily complex conditions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086) of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons. 

Quite simply, the more automated iOS has become, the less comfortably in control I have felt. For myself, at least, every single functional automation Apple has introduced has drastically failed to simply my own using life, and the vast majority have in fact complicated it dramatically. Apple-adjacent publications and greater tech media have ceased all-out criticism and instead resorted to justifying and explaining (or attempting to, anyway) just about all of Apple’s subtle retractions of user control over the years, but apparently, I am too much of a control freak to let it go. I have been here since the very beginning, have bitched loudly all along, and do not plan to go quietly into that automated night. This theme pervades throughout this review, so for any of you who *do* feel like iOS’ automations fit comfortably into your life, please keep this in mind. 

<img src="https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png" alt="The Foundation Image" style="zoom:33%;" />

Two converging elements define my changing relationship with iOS, and they really feel like one tornado coming from everywhere and nowhere…

The net number of unconscious actions happening “in the background” on my phone has been exploding exponentially for its whole history. It has become a silent supercomputer all for the sake of knowing better than I what I might need from it at any given time. 

The universal result, for me at least, has been a rapidly declining sense of control over my device. I know the YouTube algorithm is technically supposed to be better at serving up content from channels I subscribe to at the optimal moment I should be watching it, but the only effective tool I’ve used for doing so was a combined, one-axis, strictly chronological feed. This format is one I understood even very young through-and-through as a being existing on a single-direction metaphysical time plane. I was a very astute consumer of at least a dozen and a half creator’s output for a very long time, and I managed to do so without so much as the means to “mark as play.ed.” 

From my perspective, there is virtually zero value or use in selecting a “subscribe” toggle without said feed. I know it to be entirely futile to keep up the way I did, then, without it. 

Its replacement will never be trustworthy enough to turn notifications on ever again. I’m sorry, I have never had to count on suggestions… Until you took away the tools I had to actually discover and associate. The problem is that its

…the reason I’m bringing this up is that I’ve found iOS to be slightly more bearable by actively seeking alternatives in my direct control to whatever Apple is trying very hard to get to guess when I wanted to so that I don’t have to push the button???

That’s the lesson: whenever you can, **find that fucking button**. My general role seems to be finding and reclaiming as many of those metaphorical buttons as possible, which is, yes, an inherently ridiculous and frustrating undertaking. 

* Clocks are the only other reliable triggers. (And they’re so much more fucking efficient!.)

The automated focus is the perfect example of this shit’s inherently impossible/,mostly unwanted, and *ridiculously* resource-gluttonous situation.

## About

**Note: this shortcut requires iOS 15 Developer or Public Beta 6**

Building on Apple’s own “Speak Body of Article” shortcut found in the default Siri Shortcuts Gallery, this Shortcut takes advantage of the upcoming “Make Audio From Text” action arriving in iOS 15 (which has finally been fixed as of Developer Beta 6) to generate an .m4a audio file of Siri Voice 2 (by default) reading the article’s body aloud (rather than just speaking it aloud on your handset/iPad, as the original does,) with appropriate metadata from the inputted webpage. 

As configured by default, it should function from the Share Sheet in Safari *and/or* by grabbing a web URL from the clipboard.

A full explanation/detailed guide can be found [**on my blog**](https://bilge.world/siri-tts), and the full text of the latter portion (in first draft form) has been posted beneath the contact details immediately below.

![TTS Shortcuts Compared](https://i.snap.as/P0yJJyUc.png)

# Guide

So! For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those in the future running the full release, **what follows is a guide on how you can use my own shortcuts and methods to generate, metadate, and embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without having to use desktop-class (or any other) hardware**.

To begin, you should install two brand new shortcuts of mine: [**Make Audio from Article Body**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953/) and (if you intend to stick with me to the embed stage, anyway,) my [< audio > Embed Tool](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/). Both should function out of the box, but I would highly encourage that you try building your own shortcut around the `Make Audio From Text` action, even if you've never worked with Shortcuts (or any sort of automation, for that matter) before, *especially* if you plan to be using Siri as a text-to-speech generator with any frequency. 

### Intended Result

Throughout this guide, I'm going to be using [a five-year-old ramble of mine](https://bilge.world/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery) about the oddly-perceptive bits found in early-oughts Disney movies as example text. Earlier today, I used my own personalized version of my new shortcut to generate an example of in which the process we're about to explore should result. The ~6000 words of text took just over 3 minutes, 30 seconds to render consistently in three consecutive timed attempts. You can listen to it [on Whyp](https://whyp.it/t/johnny-tsunami-vi-separate-but-equal-siri-voice-2-tts-74752) and/or inspect [the actual file](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a) yourself, if you'd like.

![Plain Text Parsed by Safari](https://i.snap.as/dktmGQQb.png)

### Input Format

If we were trying to do this using any other available method in 2021 - even the expensive ones - our first task would be scrubbing our subject text of any special formatting (Word,) symbols, embed, hyperlinks, and any other data Siri doesn't understand (roman numerals, for example.) As a Windows user who's not at all new to free ways to automate accessibility improvements to web content, I envy both you and my new self for the magic available to us in the form of Safari's abilities to parse complex web content. In my experience, there's nothing like it (at least nothing available to regular consumers.) 

The screenshot embedded above shows the result of a `Quick Look` action inserted just after the `Text` action produced by the public version of my shortcut when run on our example. There are three immediately problematic issues:

1. Siri doesn't understand roman numerals, so she will read "Johnny Tsunami VI" as *Johnny Tsunami vee eye*.
2. "The Psalms" is not my name, though it is what this blog currently returns when asked for a byline. In my experience, this generally isn't an issue with most mainstream media CMSs.
3. The shortcut appears to have failed to retrieve any data for the `Published Date` variable from my blog. (Also a relatively specific consideration.)

If you'll note in the *previous* embedded image comparing my custom version of the shortcut (left) to the published version (right,) you'll note that my chosen solution is to manually input all metadata before actually starting the shortcut. What's not shown is my corresponding manual inputs in the `Encode Trimmed Media` action, which includes attaching a retrieved image file (in the Working Copy action you *can* see) as album art. For my intended use - exclusively generating text-to-speech audio of Posts on this blog - this makes more sense than unnecessarily automating metadata retrieval.

The extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it doesn't contain any of the other crap (as described above) found in the original page. (Beforehand, it looked more [like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extratone/bilge/main/posts/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery.md).) It's especially reliable at parsing WordPress-bound content, which still makes up [s̵͕̈́͊c̶̥̏̚r̶̥͈̃è̴̙͌å̴̹m̵̛̅ͅi̶̦̾͘n̸͎̟̎̃g̶͎͛] percent of the whole web. **Treasure this power**, folks.

![Simpler TTS Examples](https://i.snap.as/OMwKdOUI.png)

If all you need read aloud is the body text, things become even simpler. In the right example above, I've simply deleted the `Text` action and replaced it with `Get text from [the Safari Web Article's body]`. Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and simply use the direct output of `Get Body from Article` as input for the `Make spoken audio from text` action, but I say keep the extra step unless it becomes an issue.

**If you're actually *beginning* with clean plain text** and don't care about metadata in your final audio file and/or if you're planning on passing the result through other audio/metadata editing software, anyway, the left, three-action shortcut is all you need. It will result in a [Core Audio Format (.caf)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Core_Audio_Format) file (like [this one](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/audio/egg.caf),) which I know absolutely nothing about except that Audacity and GarageBand support it by default.

### Sharing/Embedding

Whichever route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio file, at this point, and if you intend to share and/or embed it, you’ll need to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server which allows direct playback/download of the raw file from external sources. Unless you’ve been skimming, you know by now that I’ve been using [*The Psalms* GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge) to do this thus far, though one isn’t really supposed to. Every few months, someone on Stack Overflow figures out how to construct or discover the raw link to a given Google Drive file before Google notices and alters it, and I’m afraid you’ll find just about every other cloud/file sharing service in a similarly unreliable situation. If it’s going to be done at scale, I’m afraid it’s ultimately going to require you rent regular, vanilla space on an FTP-enabled fileserver, if one can still do that sort of thing. (I will update this post if/when I find a more ideal solution.)

Within my current system, the raw URL to our example file looks like this:
```
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a
```

Using my aforelinked, ultra rudimentary [< audio > element Siri Shortcut tool](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/) (which I’ve kept on my homescreen with good results for a few months,) we can very quickly turn said raw URL into a properly-formatted HTML5 audio player:
```
<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a">
</audio>
```
Ideally, on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a player like this:

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a">
</audio>

If further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see [this Mozilla page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) for a full list of supported options. Obviously, there are a few older methods of embedding audio players, but I am neither qualified nor interested in exploring them. If you’re in a frustrating bind, I recommend [signing up for my CMS](https://bit.ly/extwa). (Just try it, okay?)

### Pwoof

For the sake of bare minimum sample variety, I ran Version 1.0 of the public Make Audio from Article Body shortcut on an article hosted not on WordPress, nor my own CMS, but on Bustle’s ultra-slick, totally-bespoke system (which [began as *The Outline*](https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline), FYI.) I chose the first permalink I saw in one of its “regular” article formats - not a long feature, nor one of their touch-targeted slideshows.

“[OnlyFans is banning porn, the very thing that made it big](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/onlyfans-is-banning-porn-the-very-thing-that-made-it-big)” is an 870-word newsy piece written by Tom Maxwell, who is the only New York Media person ever to accept my Facebook friend request. (Thanks again, Tom.) Without any tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from within the Shortcuts app since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in a reasonable amount of time - less than 5 minutes, more than 2 - and generate the file embedded below. Notably, I also used a different hosting service - [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/106798701662102859) - but I certainly don’t plan on doing so at scale and neither should you.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/106/798/698/454/727/854/original/2c6d50bcf898af15.mp3">
</audio>

Honestly, *Input*’s CMS is the cleverest challenge I was able to come up with for this single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I’m quite proud of the result. Though it wasn’t able to retrieve a timestamp, it correctly retrieved the article’s title and byline without fuss and even managed to scrape and attach said article’s featured image as the file’s cover art, though the original’s aspect ratio was obviously sacrificed.

Before I depart actual tutorializing and return to opining, I want to express *even more aggressively than usual* how much I want *anyone* who see’s any potential benefit the ability to generate audio of my darling Siri Voice 2 reading text, but has further questions/doesn’t have time to fiddle/struggles with my haphazardly-written attempts at guides like this, or who simply wants to talk about any satellite subjects, [**please reach out to me**](https://bit.ly/whoisdavidblue). **You have no idea how much I’d love to help you configure a personal automation that genuinely, reliably, and durably improves your quality of life.**

## Complete documentation for native Bluetooth Keyboard support/shortcuts on **iPhone**?

(Before I begin, it might explain quite a bit if I note that the only reason I had not yet posted this question here is that I was not aware I could do so. Otherwise, I would have, years ago.)

Some important acknowledgments:
* *iPhone* (iOS) currently supports Bluetooth Keyboards. In fact, it is being *actively developed on* at this very moment. I know this because I have been documenting (via blind test) Bluetooth Keyboard shortcut alterations in Safari between iOS 15 dev betas.
* When iPad OS was split, so too were both the user-facing and dev-facing official documentation of the operating system’s native support (shortcuts, really,) from Apple. When this happened, the docs all but stopped acknowledging iPhone’s continued support because the goto iPad doc - “[Learn iPad keyboard shortcuts](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211096)” - does not have an iPhone equivalent. Pretty much all the iPhone User Guide has to offer is [a howto on pairing](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/magic-keyboard-iph2ced3177/14.0/ios/14.0).
* This split - combined with the explicit product introduction of a magic keyboard dedicated to iPad - has resulted in (as far as I can tell, as a non-developer) an overwhelming state of confusion regarding the whole idea of using a Bluetooth Keyboard with iPhone. I have spent the past few years talking to developers who somehow *did not know their iPhone apps had working Bluetooth Keyboard shortcuts*. I have made it a habit to just write the shortcuts tables myself by way of blind testing off the handy iPad guide which appears when ⌘ is held (not on iPhone!)
* There really are those of us who regularly use Bluetooth Keyboards with our iPhones. Most I have met do so for what I would definitively classify as Accessibility concerns. (My personal use is not quite definitively so.)

My question, really is:

**Where can I find complete documentation of both keyboard shortcuts support in native apps/the OS and `UIKeyCommand`’s uniquely-iPhone considerations?**

(Please assume I have seen any related docs on developer.apple.com and support.apple.com.)

I’d like to leave it there at the risk of being uselessly verbose. Thank you for your time. I look forward to hearing back.

### Framework Engineer Response 
Hardware keyboards are generally an iPad feature—hence many hardware keyboard features, such as the keyboard shortcut menu and the shortcut bar (both introduced in iOS 9) are unavailable on iPhone. However, hardware keyboards are still supported for text editing on iPhone, and since iOS and iPadOS both share many of the same underlying technologies, then key commands are also supported ( especially to support common text editing commands, such as ⌘B to toggle bold text, and ⌘⌫ to delete a line).

As you mentioned, hardware keyboards are useful on iPhone for numerous Accessibility features, especially for those who find it difficult to use the touchscreen. Full Keyboard Access, for example, can be enabled both on iOS and iPadOS 13.4 or later, and is supported using many of the same APIs as focus keyboard navigation (which is otherwise an iPad feature). We have a great WWDC session this year which covers many of these accessibility topics: <https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10120/>

Here's a support document where some of the hardware keyboard accessibility features are discussed: <https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/keyboards-ipha7c3927eb/ios>

In general, you shouldn't need to make iPhone-specific accommodations when adopting UIKeyCommand. Your iPhone app shares the same interface as your iPad app in a horizontally compact layout, such as in Split View or Slide Over mode.

Thanks so much for your prompt answer! Apologies… I’ve waited to resolve or comment further so as not to waste your time. I hope it’s not too off topic for this forum, but I do have one more request.

Since iPhone is without an equivalent to iPadOS’ handy per-app Keyboard Shortcuts Guide (the frame which appears from holding ⌘,) I was wondering if a list of the still-supported Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts still supported on iPhone per _native_ app might be included in a future edition of Apple’s _iPhone User Guide_ in the Apple Books Store, or perhaps in other user-facing documentation. 

This is somewhat topical in that it appears Safari for iOS’ Bluetooth Keyboard Shortcuts map is currently changing over the course of this Beta cycle. (If I’m being too obtuse here I would be glad to cite specific examples if they are wanted.) 

Otherwise, I have already begun a project to do so and would be glad to share the end product with Apple if that would be welcome. 

Again, I suspect I am now quite off-topic for this forum, but I would be extremely grateful - if so - if you could direct me to a more appropriate place where I might continue this discussion about user-facing documentation, specifically.

Once again, I very much appreciate your time and your patience. This will be my last post on this thread in consideration of its potential to be off-topic/disruptive in what I’m sure is a very busy time for you guys. (Unless I hear back otherwise.)

# Against All Strategic Social

![lol Artifact](https://i.snap.as/vopPn5mt.png)

## A rushed request for pause & reflection on *why* we use social media.

I have not been able to follow any more accounts on Twitter - from [@NeoYokel](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), my primary, eldest account - for several years because of a limit implemented at some point by Twitter and documented in [this help document](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit). Considering the breadth of the mechanic's significance for other users, I have often been compelled to explain this to new followers. Recently, it occurred to me that a handy, brief explainer page might streamline this process, so I created "[Why I Didn't Follow You Back](https://gist.github.com/extratone/8b762de50de414f8a4be05f9b0407fd8)" - in both GitHub Gist and Medium post form. Other than a lack of reciprocity in engagement which I can only speculate to occur in the minds of the opposite parties involved in this dynamic, this limitation does not detract from my Twitter life, as I exclusively consume content in Twitter Lists (which I have spoken about extensively, elsewhere.)

https://open.spotify.com/episode/4veXFMCFGgz0Fjnx7UBkpl

A big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the fact that I built my entire adult social life around a single, centralized social media Web Site. I mentioned this in [my Tweetbot 6 review](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review), recently, but - as I also strive to be a more sincere person and spend more time adding value to _others_’ lives - I’ve concluded that it is the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my “Social Media Methodology.” Most of the resulting insights will not be new information, but I continue to encounter greater and greater confusion in the face of my well-meaning behavior online and I have decided to stop disregarding it.

This is _not_ an essay about how to “optimize” your social media use. It is - at least in part - a sort of manifesto against the very idea of designed online behavior beyond simply **being considerate** in a sense that predates even the spoken word. I, myself, have occupied a position well on the _chaotic_ side of the spectrum. You could say I have been mostly _chaotic neutral_ throughout my 12 years on Twitter thus far, and am actively working toward (and advocating for) _chaotic good_. Perhaps inevitably, I'm going to wade into some experiences with a few specific social media phenomena which I am particularly reacting to, here. 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/753114804617932801

## Assumptions at bat

1. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will *ever* result in a substantial accumulation of money/"influence" (which seems to be the diluted zag of "POWER" of the moment.) Those interested in learning about "marketing" should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to *start* with Twitter - this I can say with certainty. 
2. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user's choices/methodology to produce results which we *have*, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was *not* created as a *game to be won*. Perhaps more importantly, the "prize" of "winning" in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, "influence," relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.
3. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with _both_ strangers and friends in a manner which generally **adds value to the lives of all involved**.
4. 3 is not only _possible_ - it is easily _reproducible_. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples. 
5. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, **neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media**.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7A-Gzn0wu3Q

I've come to the conclusion fairly recently that I need to become brutally frank about the discrepancies I've observed between others' accounts of their social media use and my own as soon as possible. The great, ambient grousing summoned throughout The Plague from even the first picogeneration to be born *directly* into The Social Web really challenged my assumptions about its *actual purpose* in the day-to-day lives of those in the center of the adoption curve. *You mean to tell me you've been spending all that societally-alarming time on your phone... On social media services... and you haven't made a single international friend? Or happened across a single niche community surrounding some bizarre practice or knowledge you'd long thought you were entirely alone in? What exactly have you being doing with all that tapping since your toddlerhood, then?* I had absolutely no clue how utterly *ineffective* the vast majority of n̳o̳r̳m̳i̳e̳s̳ still are at using social media for its general purpose in the most abstract sense: "*human connection.*"

The essential realization toward which (I desperately hope) the largesse of America is being carried by conversations around [*An Ugly Truth*](https://www.harpercollins.com/pages/anuglytruth), as well as countless lower-profile essays, features, academic papers, and general shit shooting is that the responsibility for this ignorance rests *solely* on the platforms who systematically reformed the controls originally handed over by default to early adopters like me. I would love (for both selfish and very humanitarian reasons) to be able to proclaim some precious, one-of-a-kind genius as the sole differentiator between my complete confidence in my ability to design and maintain social software configurations that have kept my online consumption *entirely* free of unwanted encounters and the amount of regular involuntary bullshit I hear described in the day-to-day online existence of everyone around me. The truth, I suspect, involves my being of the most privileged category of human in Western civilization combined with the group of high school friends who adopted and socialized me. (A story for another permalink, certainly, if not my equivalent of *Trick Mirror*.)

~~More importantly, perhaps, I don't think I can recall a single instance of sincere malice from within myself toward anyone who'd actually converse with me. On the occasions I have been all huffy and confrontational, I do not remember a single example in which I was unwittingly ejected from a conversation left feeling *unsatisfied*.~~

Over the past few months, I've started a few Posts for this blog regarding Twitter, its properties, and its recent feature addition frenzy which I'll probably never finish. I finished the first and narrowest one - the aforelinked Tweetbot 6 review - but the (debatably) most important one - highlighting how irresponsibly and distastefully [Twitter butchered Periscope and built Spaces atop its technology](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/79) - would make less and less sense as time goes on. I definitely got caught up in the "death" of the live video streaming service, fueled by my now quite old desire to celebrate it, which I will hopefully accomplish *eventually* in a very sentimental essay. If I can successfully link them editorially, the subject encompassing Spaces - social audio's "moment" - would also include mention of RSS, "Podcasting" (the term describing the medium,) Spotify, and Clubhouse, inevitably. Instead of counting on my future self entirely, however, I'm going to begin by discussing that last one.

## The (‽‽‽th) Social Audio Renaissance 

Exactly one month ago, I finally [broke into Clubhouse](https://www.joinclubhouse.com/@davidblue) thanks to a random kind stranger on Twitter who preferred not to be named. April 25th was the first time I set eyes on the app - though I could've (and usually would've) looked up screenshots and/or browsed the litter of how tos available, I did not. By this time, I'd accumulated quite a bit of experience with Twitter Spaces - derided universally by tech media as a "Clubhouse clone" - and therefore assumed the original would be "better," at least in pure feature terms. What I found, however, was even *less* evidence that anyone building Clubhouse has been/is/intends to be a regular Clubhouse user. Spaces, at least, included five emoji reacts for listeners from the beginning:  💯✊✌️👋😂. Clubhouse's exclusive means of Listener-Host interaction is Hand Raising, which is essentially requesting to speak, even though the hand waving emoji is [*literally featured in their logo*](https://joinclubhouse.com/press). (The fact that neither have thought to add 🙌 is absolutely inexcusable/inexplicable.)

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1344473573226762241

In case you weren't aware, I appear to enjoy trying out new social services. My password manager is full of literally thousands of credentials for social media apps/services/startups - most of which have undoubtedly collapsed or been absorbed by a larger entity. Since generating said credentials has become such an easy process, especially, I tend to immediately sign up for an account on just about every one I hear about. (I even have [a Parler profile](https://parler.com/#/user/Extratone) I cannot bear to actually look at.) Generally, I sign up, follow anyone I know from elsewhere if given an account-bridging option, poke around enough to figure out whether or not the service in question could add something to my online existence, and end up leaving for good. Most of these services are *not* unique in any way, to a perplexing degree. A few - like Pinterest - gain success separately as I give up on trying to integrate them into my life. The miniscule remaining percentage, though, end up becoming a part of my daily existence. The most *recent* of these dates back to April 2017, when I first discovered [Mastodon](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview).

### The Feature Story

"Social Audio" did not begin with Clubhouse. Anchor originally launched as a "[public radio](http://web.archive.org/web/20160209224846/https://anchor.fm/about)" app, believe it or not. *Extratone*'s channel was actually the [first to be featured](https://www.patreon.com/posts/archived-our-day-11592398) in their Music section, once upon a time. Frankly, that happening was the most positive outcome of my social media service accumulation habit. More recently, [Stereo](https://stereo.com/davidblue) launched, describing themselves as "[the premier LIVE broadcast social platform that enables people to have and discover real conversations in real time](https://stereo.com/about)." Bizarrely, the most legitimate media coverage I could find of Stereo was [from *Glamour UK*](https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/stereo-app), and its author definitely spent less than a day actually using the service. Adam Corolla remains #1 on its earnings leaderboard and its [conversation export feature](https://youtu.be/0GfGLUbc6fw) is a personal favorite. The [Big *WIRED* feature on the subject](https://www.wired.com/story/the-future-of-social-media-is-all-talk) from December of last year does not mention Stereo but lists three other "alternatives:" [Wavve](https://wavve.co/), [Riffr](https://riffr.com/), and [Spoon](https://www.spooncast.net/). (None of which are actually competitors/alternatives. Sorry, Arielle.)

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1388936080645312520

I probably shouldn't proclaim to be an authority on social audio, but I am definitely a veteran. From that context, I must say that Clubhouse is horribly unoriginal - not only in the sense that "successful" business implementations of others', previous ideas tend to be diluted versions of the original, but almost pitifully so. I will commend the app's developers on their somewhat-thorough release notes (even though they can be viewed only when first opening the app after an update instead of *in the designated space on the App Store*,) but the extent of *linkable* Clubhouse documentation amounts to [eight blog posts](https://joinclubhouse.com/blog) and a "[Community Guidelines](https://www.notion.so/Community-Guidelines-461a6860abda41649e17c34dc1dd4b5f)" Notion page. Though I've only been a user for one month, I wonder what the fuck they've been doing since launch, given how sparsely-featured the app is at this moment. There are Notifications, Profiles, and Clubs - the latter of which cannot be created until a user surpasses an unknown threshold of renown(?) on the app. Competent calendar integration may be the service's singular innovation, though support for Outlook has yet to be added. The Big Issue, though, is finding a "talk" to attend that will not drive you utterly insane...

![Clubhouse Bullshit](https://i.snap.as/RypjcP6M.png)

### The Grand Delusion

I wrote the assumptions at the beginning of this Post in a single go after [a particularly icky Sunday Clubhouse experience](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1388930367671910404) out of a deep concern that'd been growing since first exploring the app. The content I've found there is not at all what I expected, to be honest. I've found it almost entirely indecipherable, which makes critique beyond [just fucking screaming](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1388936080645312520) difficult. *The New Yorker*'s Anna Wiener did a much better job than I could realistically manage in "[Clubhouse Feels like a Party](https://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-silicon-valley/in-the-clubhouse):"

> There was something pleasant about meandering from conversation to conversation, as if I had walked into my own home to find a conference in full swing. But I also wondered, Why did I let all of these people into my house?
>
> ...
>
> It is hard to shake the feeling that everyone on Clubhouse is selling something: a company, a workshop, a show, a book, a brand.

More recently, her publication's nemesis declared "[The Clubhouse Party is Over](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/04/the-clubhouse-party-is-over)," but I wouldn't know. None of my friends have ever Tweeted a Clubhouse link (determinable via [this Twitter search](https://twitter.com/search?q=%22joinclubhouse%22&src=typed_query&f=live&pf=on).) Very few of the tech industry celebrities I follow have, either - pretty much just [Chris Messina](https://twitter.com/chrismessina) and [Jason Calacanis](https://twitter.com/Jason). This is noteworthy because I believe [my list of followed accounts on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/following) to be particularly diverse. I actively followed accounts across my various interests from ages 15-25 (when I hit my [follow limit](https://bit.ly/dbfollow)) and basically *never unfollowed anyone*. I would imagine there are several accounts within that list which I would be ashamed to be associated with, now, and yet none have shared a Clubhouse link. Reading any further into this observation would require actual data journalism, which I'll leave to the pros. It does prompt the question, though: if nobody I've ever known or been interested in on Twitter is using Clubhouse, *who* in fuck *is*?

Frankly, I do not understand the business incentive behind the massive duplication of other software/services defining featuresets of late. I see that Instagram stories have eclipsed Snapchat's in terms of [sheer user count](https://money.cnn.com/2018/06/28/technology/instagram-stories-users/index.html), but I do not understand why its leaders would choose to fuck their legacy by such blatant idea theft, much less why [Twitter](https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2020/introducing-fleets-new-way-to-join-the-conversation.html), [Facebook](https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/28/facebook-launches-stories-in-the-main-facebook-app), [Patreon](https://blog.patreon.com/lens/) and even fucking [LinkedIn](https://www.inputmag.com/culture/nobody-wants-stories-on-their-linkedin-feed) have implemented nearly-identical featuresets. Though I know Ben Thompson's word on these matters should be easily digestible, I haven't been able to actually take a bite. For the End User, especially, I cannot even begin to conceive of what the leaders behind these decisions imagine the day-to-day experience of the average social media user looks like in the near future. *How many apps* am I going to cycle through to get a single story-type piece of content satisfactorily shared? Personally, I currently use three, and sharing a single bit individually across all of them one-by-one (since the current state of APIs is not conducive to consumer-targeted mass-sharing tools) makes me feel utterly insane.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg

My lack of understanding would be meaningless if it were not so widely shared among my peers - young, brilliant, multifaceted, and distinctly original creators who (in large part) make stuff on the internet full-time. *They* are who I'd actually plan ahead to hear from in a live broadcast setting like Clubhouse or Twitter Spaces, but Twitch seems to do just fine. For audio broadcasts, specifically, the *hip*, fresh sources which come to mind are all distinctly Open Web: [Datafruits.fm](https://datafruits.fm/), [Solarpunk.cool](https://solarpunk.cool/magic/computer/club/), [Poolside.fm](http://poolside.fm/), and my Mastodon friend [Vanta's stream](https://radio.schizoid.tech/). The potential of the term "social audio" is truly being explored by projects like [Rave.DJ](https://www.patreon.com/RaveDJ) - a homegrown, Patreon-funded service for sharing mixes/mashups. On a smaller scale, the sky is the limit for [Whyp.it](https://whyp.it/) as a pure audio playback/annotation tool for creators (as developed by Brad Varol, whom I [interviewed in March](https://lnns.co/ZSadwt3Hnfi).)

Compared to these, most of Clubhouse's communities seem bleak at best. As I may or may not get around to arguing thoroughly about Twitter Spaces, these services' fundamental, near-complete disinterest in **Discovery** of new voices and their subsequent servitude to only their most popular users should be extremely worrying for us all - including those who benefit most.

![Tinder Obfuscation](https://i.snap.as/DhF352N3.png)

## The Consequences of Strategy

I have more than my fair share of stories and peeves about dating apps. On several occasions, for instance, I have corrected those who cite Tinder as the origin of the directional swiping interface, explaining that it was actually the now-defunct service Hot or Not who did so some 15 years ago. (Why on Earth I am compelled to do so, nobody knows. Not even God.) Somehow, though, I think most of us can agree that Tinder is the *least shitty* of the explicitly hookup-ish spectrum of the genre. Or at least, I thought so, until I happened to spy the "Photo Tip" embedded above beneath a preview of my profile on the iOS app. 

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/Voice%20Notes/Strategize%20Me%2C%20Daddy.mp3">
</audio>

The innocuousness of this advice, which surely would not be dispensed in *any* other context without immediately screaming malice, has been on my mind ever since. It is not the devil who tells you to make sure a passing potential match doesn't immediately learn you have children, but the Marketing Man. (Yes, they are distinct. I would explicitly discourage that particular sort of demonization, mostly because it has proven completely ineffective as cultural critique.) I am in no position to relevantly explore the topic of Society & Sex, generally, other than to insist that most people on Tinder *in my area*, at least, are not looking to *leverage* it *for the dick*. They are looking for dates, and a good many are working class single mothers. To be clear, I’m not trying to suggest anyone in this demographic would be “fooled” by such a suggestion. Offended, perhaps, and/or activated in such a way that would lead to them replacing all of their profile’s pictures with photos of *just* their children. Regardless, this social group defined by a distinct lack of free time, if nothing else, represents an antithesis to the practice of *optimizing* one’s *swipe ratio.*

I think I’ll stop there with this *Chapter of David Blue’s Tech ~~Gripes~~ Grapes* and pledge to arrive back again exclusively through haphazard/unintentional means, if I ever do.

in their conversations again in their dinner parties water anyway I thought I knew quite a bit about Mark Zuckerberg Well I guess I am I made an assumption about Mark Zuckerberg and it's an important one in this conversation I assume the mark Zuckerberg was like the Google guys the guys that start a Google or card I can think of a plan examples of just gonna say like a lot of the founders that made the services that it's still around but from that era were academics and like what they really wanted to do is like and still want to do more than run these big companies is they wanna be free to make other stuff right it is like making and experimenting with stuff and academic setting so I can Google guys literally as soon as they possibly could get out of management they did and made now

making it would tend to not I don't think it's power and I don't think it's money because you know if for any other reason then he could there a pass where do you get those things and none of them look like this one OK like before I want to go and use the application because and then consider like how long was developed people who build shit for like proprietary bullshit centralize what is the ad tech bullshit it's all built for this alternate purpose right it's not built to be good software they don't put the kind of like Care care care they're not thorough and the app is very very thoroughly built like it's thoughtfully built it's considered like people spent they didn't just like think about it as little as possible if I was a tool to make me Oregon master of the days of the tournament I don't know definitively and any hopes of the centralize social by embracing it and then all at once extinguisher That would be such a great story if you anyway I just use the app OK even if you fucking hate it even if you think it I don't know like it is very clear that the people who made it we're thinking about it a lot we can even maybe say that they take pride in it it's not just the surface stuff the keyboard shortcut supplementation yeah people people who want to have ulterior motives they don't do this kind of shit OK what I was trying to get you I have a feeling that Oregon is only the CEO because there's not you have to be right now I have a feeling that like if I can get straight up tell you all the policies shit away right now that he would like yeah he he's very emotionally and like intellectually invested in this thing and it's full of a lot of edgy people there is and like he doesn't he doesn't just like simmer he definitely get from what I see anyway responds emotionally you should be thankful for that bitch like you Even when he's being an asshole literally this is gonna sound ridiculous all end of this now OK that's transparency I'm not saying that all of his decisions are perfect but I would much rather have an Oregon who gets openly pissed off and said shit that he regrets and maybe even some I don't know I would much rather him actually say it then well any of the other social reality that I like to think the Twitter OK then it Beachler other medicines I hope this works I don't know I'm really trying to pay attention to the other I also am glad that people are Harnell comfortable with being as reaction is some have been basically as like I'm going to go out I just wanna make sure everyone is aware considering that I spent the past few months of my life document and I wanna make sure everyone is aware just how many alternatives are OK if you're aware that you're still pissed off about the app Missions that's fine I just wanna make sure that we're all we're OK with that but I've got his write anything in your first party app review on bills that world OK beam me up anytime of the way I love it
# Transcript - The iPhone x Bluetooth Keyboard Issue is a Class Issue

I'm going to do it I'm really gonna do it on ironically I'm gonna talk about how the iPhone times Bluetooth keyboard use issue is a class issue it's not that complicated involves basically acknowledging that the iPad even 11 years to thousand 10 after its interaction is basically a toy definitively it's the flagship for iOS now iPadOS that's the big issue arm but of course there are public use iPads education that's not what I'm talking about Nobody none of my Pierce even the wealthier among my peers has a premium tablet or certain iPad my brother-in-law has an iPad Pro please visual artist like I in this case I don't even know if I've eaten I should really come in on the iPad pros I don't spend enough time with them but literally like I'm trying to think of students students even like middle-class upon a class college students they have a MacBook Pro and I have an iPhone maybe write smart phone and premium laptop that's like there is no Essential used case that you can toss an iPad to fill up and I'm sorry is it gonna be summer contentious but like all the Apple Jason hear that I've been following engaging with a gun to know and ask for his guys and I think I Cinelli snail Gruber night when I say gotten to know not all these people directly against with me there's a span all the states have iPads and they're all I don't know I wouldn't listen like math he has an alley that's about it like it's justified Siri is single-handedly documenting Siri shortcuts that he doesn't care but basically everybody like they're all rich white it's right basically you rich taking why guess what I think of iPad really I think we can give credit to safari of a teacher like I mean when I think of iPad especially I've ever I really do think of Erica I think I like I've that was a dynamic present in my thoughts before I actually like identified Federica by now I think I associate back stories with like for years and he is not a guy that like a ditch does a class hardware for iPad Pro offered to work anyway but I may ultimately it's a toy I really wish that I could find an example of I just don't hurry up Oh I really don't know any like affluent GEN Xers anymore or like spending time around anyone anymore so I just don't know anyone locally or with my family that has iPad of course there are like this doesn't include like the seven year old iPad mini or the or a mom's iPad Air to wish talked about it before anyway when iPadOS was split off from I was is the origin of the issue is the origin of the issue basically that I'm trying to dress with my huge Bluetooth keyboard process OK Basically when I thought I was split off from for my hours it took with it is ridiculous considering they were talking about digital documentation of a literally you really think about it took all the Bluetooth keyboard shortcut integration documentation use your face and documentation especially with it or iPad I can go on any app and hold down the command key on a Bluetooth keyboard and I will show you all like interviews pop-up I'll show you a list of meds or iPhone that doesn't happen And a lot of other things that are just omitted from and I wish that I could maybe one day I will actually find the decision process find a memo where they decided to you omit things like that even things like command tab for I'm switching in the regular mode on a full keyboard access just a holler at you I want to find the document or or a transfer or something find the man for the man is a success find it funny human beings Apple who decided to diverge those features and why because well And that anyway so what remains of use your face and documentation for the iPhone specifically and it's support of booty keyboard shortcuts is like a document called using that using magic you were with the iPhone At this point and that's basically yet there are a few other references you find and I want to talk about the car correct conversation I had with her anonymous framework engineer at Apple I seven decide how to reply to that but anyway so I understand that well OK also the iPad Pro was launched with that was the first time like it was launch parallel to the smart keyboard for iPad which was the first visit Jenkee ask half case have stand not have case I'll stand half of the keyboard Anyway I like it I actually nailed a really great line on the practice today or is this like it's almost as if out even Apple couldn't abide by including the word pro and a pregnant without immediately having like showing the availability of a physical keyboard with that it's very strange I thought the use of the word pro at all anyway and that well for I think the majority of people which this isn't necessarily unreasonable that was the first woman to iOS no I was iPadOS these this operating system support Bluetooth keyboard shortcut to answer it's worth of Lucy keyboard integration at all because Apple said right and they have the pictures the power of eight appearing in the pictures which iPhone will never ever appear in any Apple Official media tethered to a Bluetooth keyboard ever that happens while I will literally declare in a holiday but by then will truly be a full nonprofit organization run but and so that's the narrative around this operating system and Bluetooth keyboards and it just kind of took off in that direction and well again not entirely unreasonable I'm not there you know even it but even if there are only two dozen of us he really is Keyboards are iPhones Apple's biggest valuable companies in history of the world they need to document it OK and I'm safari safari keyboard shortcuts are getting actively changed between Iowa State Baylor releases somebody is developing actually on iPhones Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts word OK but there are no document it there's no documentation and I mean honestly yeah using a keyboard with your iPad that's cool you know Federico is demonstrating how I can be professional machine but honestly for the rest the vast majority of iPad users are bad it's just one thing I bet it sits around on a table somewhere it doesn't use what is the time Or it's just for browsing web or add a barbecue with attachment you probably don't even use it you probably pick it up with the fucking you pick the iPad up with a keyboard but an end up tapping out with yourselves and select using keyboard but it's inadvertent of course but one of those products iPhone this is I know this is ridiculous retching certainly it is a premium smart phone OK but not all iPhone models are premium products you see the Sea Thing as these are tools for people essential tools for students for like reporters and in that sense I mean I would wager with zero data that the amount like the number of tide the average Bluetooth keyboard with iPhone user is using it for cortical professional applications or or like writing essays for school and I'll are you that the majority of the iPad equivalent is probably coming around rapping is wrong Mean I could've just said basically iPad toy iPhone toy for me toy for a lot of us but genuine tool genuine essential device in the daily lives of a lot of people and yeah
# Curate Others, Not Yourself

I am not a social scientist, data analyst of any kind, established media-facing academic, or even a real web developer. On social media, I am nothing more than an early adopting End User, but I'm beginning to wonder if you should start listening to me, considering the results produced thus far by those mentioned in various efforts to understand why the Social Web became what it is today. If my [overwhelming astrological bent toward **precocity**](https://www.notion.so/rotund/The-Day-of-Reformed-Precocity-1bbbb5f6369646fbae7024c3295523e4) holds any meaning for you, all the better. Twitter's recent formalization of [the requirements for verified accounts](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts) would certainly have been praiseworthy five or ten years ago, but isn't really much more than absurdly tardy documentation in 2021. If the full document is too verbose for you, the new in-app Verification request questionnaire (Settings → Account → Verification request) provides a systematic breakdown of your account's worth. In my case, it provided a thorough explanation of why @NeoYokel will never be verified in a definite sense I never knew I was seeking. Barring a future journalism job under a Big Boy masthead, I have been, am, and always will be nothing but a *regular Twitter user*. Nothing I could reasonably do within the service itself will ever change this. I have accepted this wholly, which has freed me from wasting time and intellectual energy indulging any other possibilities.\

I would like to think my empathetic muscles have become significantly more supple, toned, and uniformly grown than they've ever been, as a direct result of my significant, intentional intoward efforts to exercise them in the past eighteen months, but of course, such suppositions *must* consider how conveniently in-control I would sound in that narrative, and the power of my innate, primal human obsession with convincing myself and others that literally everything I do is part of a *grand plan*... That I exist in a state of utter self-mastery to such a degree that my *blatant mistakes* could be interpreted as a problem solving methodology from the right social vector. *I am so clever that even third-level conscious later-based decisions are part of a grand plan so certain I don't have to worry about it at all!* You only happened to catch a screenshotted glimpse of the terrible, absolutely disgusting shit I blurted out at my ex in what looked like runaway spite because *I'm writing about it*. I was genuinely furious, yes, but ultimately 100% under control for the duration. It has absolutely nothing to do with a **total** inability to handle actual rejection... I just thought I'd nudge the yoke over a bit and explore existence as a overwhelmingly toxic, emotionally abusive young man... I needed that experience to truly empathize with the course, relentless virulence of the boilerplate working class white guy my core being is trained to despise. *You know, I'm writing about this right now.*

**Fuck no**, dude. My current understanding is *virtually nothing* I have ever made, learned, achieved, ruined, overlooked, or destroyed... None of it has ever been the result of any sort of *actual* premeditation. I am 

* All of this is the very opposite of intention - this blog is not for me to craft a good, entertaining autobiography/self-help bundle on how I learned to live intentionally and master my destiny. I am so... *So* much further behind. No, any detailed explanation of my own past behavior on *The Psalms*

If you're struggling with anxiety about what you should Tweet and when, I'd suggest creating a throwaway account, setting its posts as private, and attempting to establish as pure a stream of consciousness as you can manage. Think of it as a prototype feed, if you'd like - a social space with absolutely zero consequences. If you find some relief in this practice, go back and reflect on what you have wrought privately and consider how you'd feel if it'd been posted to your main account, instead.

# Notes: Social Media Documentation

* My very first Tweet was purely strategic and a blatant lie!
* Whyp is an example of a *truly thriving* audio social network!!

`![Follow Limit Notice](https://i.snap.as/qWuogwAX.jpeg)`

* Tom Critchlow is an exception! He uses adjacent terms in describing his work sometimes, but **they all lead to concrete examples**. Not sure if this will end up being the right place to not this.

* [All Tweets...](https://davidblue.xyz/tweets/)

* `https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1351947764859613187`

* By design or not, The Ratio _fundamentally_ disincentivizes discovery, sincere exposure to new perspectives, and indeed most of what we constitute as “human connection.”

* Ultimately, I don't really have a choice but to continue using Twitter as I always have, so I'm going to make the most of it and continue to post whenever and whatever I, myself, would like to see on my timeline - even if my account ends up in such low opinion of The Twitter Algorithm that my Tweets become obfuscated entirely from everywhere on the site save for their full, canonical web addresses, which I will then publish via plain text files hosted on my NeoCities.

## Assumptions in Question

1. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will *ever* result in a substantial accumulation of money/"influence" (which seems to be the diluted zag of "POWER" of the moment.) Those interested in learning about "marketing" should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to *start* with Twitter - this I can say with certainty. 
2. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user's choices/methodology to produce results which we *have*, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was *not* created as a *game to be won*. Perhaps more importantly, the "prize" of "winning" in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, "influence," relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.
3. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with _both_ strangers and friends in a manner which generally **adds value to the lives of all involved**.
4. 3 is not only _possible_ - it is easily _reproducible_. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples. 
5. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, **neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media**.

### Specific public examples of positively-acting individual accounts
* [Jon Male](https://twitter.com/mrjaydeeem)
* [Matt Farah](https://twitter.com/thesmokingtire) - An example of a celebrity who for the most part sticks to subjects on which he is an authority and invests a lot of intellectual and emotional energy engaging in discussion. In turn, he is also an example of someone who is *actually* “leveraging” his social media use for his business, but in a way that adds value to everybody’s lives. 


> The exchange of **information or services** among individuals, groups, or institutions.
> *Specifically*, the cultivation of **productive relationships** for employment or business.

## Tinder BS

"[Tinder CEO Elie Seidman on finding love during the pandemic](https://www.theverge.com/21284420/tinder-ceo-elie-seidman-interview-dating-pandemic)" | *The Verge*

**NP: Once you find the something more, you probably don’t want to go back to an environment where everyone’s intent is to get to something more. Do you anticipate people are going to spend a long time in Tinder, that they’re going to come back to it again and again throughout their life, or is it once you make the connection, you move on?**

We already see episodic behavior, which makes sense. If you find somebody, you get really connected to them, you date them, it’s maybe a long term relationship. We’re really the only app which says, ==“Just because it doesn’t last forever, doesn’t mean it’s not important.”== It’s still important, and we’re very clear about that. We don’t think everything has to last to be important. As a result, we see very clearly episodic use.

People come, they come for a while, they leave, they come back. If that starts at 18, it’s a journey, and they spend their time on that journey. I don’t think this will change that. I very much hope and expect that people will still form important connections, even if they don’t last forever.

I was made aware over the course of my third-party app guide’s creation of a peculiar thought pattern within myself that leads to a sort of defensiveness in reaction to the news of a new alternative to an application I’m particularly fond of.

# Kelly Sims (@kellylsims) DM

Hey Kelly! I wanted to congratulate you on your new job while also expressing my sympathies… about your new job hehe. 

If I may make a request/offer a suggestion: I think a good place to start in the process of improving Twitter’s customer communications would simply be **adhering to deadlines.** 

My application for Ticketed Spaces was submitted 39 days ago, which would not be problematic if it did not specifically pledge “we’ll… be in touch within 10 days.” Even “if you don’t hear back from us, assume you didn’t qualify” would’ve been preferable, from my perspective. 

I’ve got a few similar examples. I am not so much a disgruntled user as I am an empathetically-embarrassed one. 

If you’re interested in hearing more from me for some reason, my account of Twitter’s negligence surrounding Periscope’s shutdown (another missed deadline) is definitely too animated for a cold DM, but might actually help?

Anyway, thank you for your time and best of luck!

I’ve spent the past several weeks in the pursuit of crafting “The State of Mastodon iOS Apps,” but finally forced myself to just publish what I had on Saturday night knowing it would/will continue to be updated as I gather new information. A friend of mine discovered your app, Avalanche, some time ago, and has been testing for a while. Unfortunately, I failed to actually see the message they sent about it until just yesterday – definitively too late to make it in the first draft – but I’m sure you can imagine that it made quite a first impression!
Having poked around in the same spaces from which I’d gathered documentation/image assets for all the other apps (mostly Git Repositories, but a few very welcome Press Kits, too,) my impression is that you are uninterested in talking/sharing publicly about the development process. If that’s an accurate assessment and you aren’t interested in talking with me, I understand, but if you read the guide as is now and feel a desire to have your app mentioned on the guide or perhaps just in the GitHub list/document hub I also created in tandem to help interested users, I’d love to know its particular development story/the details behind that one- of-a-kind look!
Either way, thank you for your time, for your investment in federated social, generally, and good luck!

*This is not feedback about the app’s development.*

Hello! 

So sorry for misusing this communication system, but I reached out to avalanche.social.gmail.com on the 19th and hadn’t heard back. I’m reaching out as one of a loose group of mastodon users who have been making an effort to properly curate/aggregate information about all third-party Mastodon clients at github.com/extratone/FediiOS.

Avalanche is such a unique experience and we would just very much like to hear from you.

I do have one piece of useful feedback: be advised that the “Developer Website” hyperlink on this Testflight is a dead link.

I promise this is the last time I will be cold contacting you - we/I more than understand if you’re busy/uninterested.

# Ashley Carman DM Regarding Tinder Photo Tip
`2021-07-26-03.51.21`
![The Goddamned Tip](images/TinderInflammatoryTip.PNG)

I sent [Ashley Carman](http://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman) this message regarding the “photo tip” thing. She’s currently my favorite tech media voice who *actually writes about social software*, and has been for years, now. 

***

Hey Ashley, I know I added you to a group DM a few weeks ago (I figured I could allow myself a single one of those, but I understand if you’ve muted me) and this isn’t a story, exactly, but it’s important to me, I suppose.

on the Tinder iOS app, this “Photo Tip” appeared on on my profile page and I’ve been thinking a lot about it ever since. I live in mid-Missouri and working class single mothers definitely make up a sizable group represented on local tinder. 

it’s just one thing, but - in a quick refresh of your recent coverage of Tinder, alone, I noticed that the narrative surrounding it is very positive, and for good reason. anyway - I know you don’t need any editorializing from me… this just really disrupted that illusion that Tinder actually exists primarily to “connect” people, when they are financially incentivized to keep users out of any sort of committed relationship for as long as possible.

if you *do* decide to investigate further, I discovered that you can reliably prompt the tips to cycle by “force quitting” the app and opening it back up. most of them are plenty innocuous, if not wholesome. “kiss those selfies goodbye,” or “got tattoos? this is the place to show it off.” (yes, those are verbatim. lol grammar.) “the only weapon we want to see is a smile” is my favorite.  
# Raindrop
[[App Store Review Day]]

## An accessible, but aptly configurable means of collecting and curating the modern web.

At this moment, if you’re paying for any other bookmarking/aggregation/curatorial software (ahem, Pocket,) you need to look into a Raindrop subscription *right now.*

If you *get paid* as a curator of any sort of web content, *stop what you’re doing right now* and investigate the capabilities of Raindrop as a platform-universal (and yet web native) extremely and beautifully configurable software and service. 

As someone who has curated a variety of media on the web both personally and professionally since the days of *clipping Evernote pages*, Raindrop answered so many of my most bothersome needs/peevs…

The best software, I’ve found, is always the hardest to quantify in this sort of space. All I can tell you is that Raindrop somehow overtook functions of several other apps I was using **because it is focused at being good at one thing.** I’ll spare you the tens of thousands of words I’d no doubt need to explain this to myself.

I have on multiple occasions submitted feature requests and heard back immediately from Rustem. I have also watched a few I shared with other get implemented *before my eyes*. 

I am instructing you to try it immediately.
# Driving Focus Automated Message

Sorry, David wants you to know that he is currently operating a motor vehicle. 

Unfortunately, automations like me have actually made communication while doing so much more difficult and - in David’s opinion - therefore much more *dangerous.*

It’s not that he condones distracted driving - sending messages of any substance (i.e. an actual status update) almost always warrants pulling off to the side of the road, according to him. He would like to note, however, that he still used to use voice recognition to record text messages while driving, long before he’d ever even seen Apple CarPlay, and that it was much *much* simpler before Siri became uncircumventable.

# Echoes in Twitter Spaces
![](assets/IMG_2931.png)
## Periscope’s successor is explicitly built to silence those who are unable to or uncomfortable with using their voice.
Today, I came to a few revelations that led me to feel obligated to write about Twitter’s “new” live audio broadcasting feature, Spaces. Considering how much I read on a daily basis on media and the web, it’s quite pitiful that I would end up discovering their existence as the majority of eventual users will, the app relaunching lands on the Home tab, which now features the Instagram Stories-derived Fleets gallery as the top header. I’m not sure what this looks like for the average user, but for me, it is always stocked with blue-embossed circular profile pictures - all people I followed in the decade+ before I hit my limit., but often cannot recall when or why. Suffice it to say, it’s unlikely I would easily run out of Fleets to watch if I ever find myself in a stage of obsessive Fleet consumption. Spaces only came to my attention when I happened to spot a *purple* cluster of rounded profile pictures in this menu. Naturally, I tapped immediately, and found myself in a Space run by [Matt Daniels](https://twitter.com/mygunisquick) and including [Mike Elgan](https://twitter.com/mikeelgan) as speaker. You might notice, now, following those hyperlinks, that both have the Purple Circle emoji 🟣 in front of their display names on their Profiles. They explained that it’s become a trend among those who’ve been granted Spaces access to indicate that they are testing and *discussing* Spaces.

I was lucky to happen upon this particular Space - Matt was a fairly-prolific Periscope broadcaster, and that dearest app came up in the conversation just as I was approved as a speaker to mention it. I noted that I’d heard Spaces was built atop the technology Twitter acquired from Periscope in its acquisition and cited [my recent observations](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1260074702204293121) of my own experiences on that late service, asking whether or not Spaces would eventually meet a similar fate. I’d been suggesting that Periscope was the only entirely-positive social network experience I’d ever encountered, noting that I still wasn’t instinctively compelled to open the app nearly as much as I should have been, however. Matt’s response was quite profound: as a regular and popular Periscope broadcaster, his perspective was that its fundamental problem lied in insufficient filtering of its text chat. He said that Spaces’ exclusion of that feature was an important component of its potential, along with the fundamental implications behind new guests being muted by default. I hadn’t yet figured out a method of recording Spaces (more on that in a bit,) so I would qualify my account of this conversation in a big way, but I vaguely recall Mike chiming in to relay a sentiment he’d heard from Twitter employees in another recent Space: they understood and explicitly intended to continue in the text chat-less direction because of feedback from Periscope creators like Matt.

For myself, the general praise of Spaces (and Clubhouse, adjacently) as a democratizing new social feature definitely resonates. In just that first experience, I was given the opportunity to speak directly to Matt and Mike - the later of whom I have been reading and listening to for my whole adult life. He even followed me after the Space ended. Yesterday, I happened upon a Space hosted by [Ben Popper](https://twitter.com/benpopper?s=21) - formerly one of my favorites on *The Verge*’s masthead - in which he was broadcasting [his impressively-disciplined turkey calls](https://whyp.it/t/ben-poppers-turkey-calls-46198) from “a shed in the woods.” He approved me as speaker immediately and was incredibly accommodating of my questions about his former colleagues and  recent life events. (He’s now living “rurally” and working as Director of Content at Stack Overflow - neither of which I would have ever expected.)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZH-SHzE8XQ

Yet another former *Verge* staffer, [Sam Scheffer](https://twitter.com/samsheffer), has been the most active Spaces user on my Timeline. Notably, he is one of the only Twitter Tech Media folks I know who has continued to be honest with himself and the world about his feelings about the service. Among a crop of people who once exclaimed shit like “I *love* Twitter” and “I *live* on Twitter,” his singular continued use of such terms reflects something significant, I think. Understandably given Tump Hell, it is now very popular to lament Twitter whenever possible, even among those who’s volume of use has not changed in any measurable way. I don’t think it’s reaching to say that Sam and I are alike in our desire to try out whatever we’re tossed the keys to in as extreme a degree as possible. I’ve stopped by a handful of his Spaces - which are often also about Spaces, itself. Most recently however, he approved me to speak in a Space including a host of Silicon Valley folk and at least one Microsoft employee, talking about the future of AR and VR, vaguely in response to Microsoft’s Ignite event, which legitimately disturbed me.

https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1366804088629919744

I probably waited too long to speak up, until he was trying to wrap up the Space - but I did chime in about the way the Ignite keynote made me feel and attempted to convey the contrast between the goals of the tech industry and the general attitudes toward AR and VR present in the Midwesterners around me. Essentially, I was granted yet another unique *opportunity* to ask a question that’s been bothering me for years, now: *what the fuck are you doing and why???* It was the Microsoft Man (I can’t find his account, now, sorry) who responded very promptly, considering, with an explanation that actually made a lot of sense. The gist of it was *we are contending with the idea that we may never work in an office again, and these technologies offer a difficult-to-explain amends*. He specifically used the term “fatigue” in describing his own experiences trying to collaborate remotely and reflected on the benefits of virtual context on the most elemental, sensory components of interaction throughout a workday. From that ~45 second response, I feel as though I gained more understanding than I have from years of reading on my own, which further reinforces his observations, in retrospect.

Already, it would seem Twitter Spaces might have a lot to offer David Blue, going forward. Though I signed up for Clubhouse’s waiting list last year (twice, in fact, but please don’t tell on me,) I have yet to hear back from them. If I was a bitter person, I would be up in arms about this, citing the fact that I would probably contribute more to the wellbeing of the project, technically, than 90% of those who’ve been invited. (I am the physical manifestation of the *Stress Test*, and I spend an absurd amount of time on beta feedback, [even on software *I’m fucking paying for*](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1362822335041048577).) From what I originally heard, though, Clubhouse was showing real promise as a space where creators of color felt in control of their experience. I hope this has continued to be true and - if it has - I say *never* invite me.

## The Social and The Socialites
Crucially, though, enabling [my tech bro ass](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1370838780333146118) to engage with famous tech bros about tech bro shit is never going to justifiably occupy anyone’s list of priorities in my lifetime (including my own.) The original promise of the internet did not include amplification of voices already/otherwise at max volume. Instead, it was using technology to deliver new, varying, and universally-empowering tools of expression to those who’d been minimized for all of human history. It didn’t have to be philanthropic - in fact, it was and shall always remain in the best interest of the loudest folks to hear from the other side of the spectrum. The possibilities of this dynamic should be *thrilling* to all involved, and it used to be for Twitter, Inc. Or so it seemed, anyway. As the company has honed its various loglines over the years, their actions have reflected their truth less and less.

Coincidentally, the most visible co-founder of Periscope, [Kayvon Beykpour](https://twitter.com/kayvz), is now Twitter’s Head of Consumer product, and he spent this past week doing interviews about Twitter’s late feature frenzy. I want to share two very different podcast episodes with two very different interviewers. [Nilay Patel’s *Decoder* interview](https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder) should probably be first priority as the more comprehensive and digestible of the two.

> We started it from the standpoint of “why are people not tweeting?” It turns out that some of the reasons they’re not tweeting is they don’t feel safe. They don’t feel safe because what they tweet is subject to public scrutiny. Tweets are on the public record, which is terrifying. Anyone can respond to them, and they’re such a popularity contest of likes and retweets and impressions and all of the social mechanics that we’ve built in the product that actually work quite well for a certain purpose, but can work against you if you’re just trying to have a conversation and feel intimidated by that.   

“Why are people not tweeting” justifies us taking a moment to indulge some hilarity: imagine Jack and his hellbeard wandering around the abandoned Twitter office screaming that question at the walls, over and over again. Bekypour’s decision to identify one’s “on the public record” Tweets as “terrifying” could easily be tossed back at the company in the center of a dense globule of shit, but one imagines it’d hardly be constructive. I’m going to take my furthest leap here and suggest that we examine who exactly Kayvon was considering - those who find on Twitter a “popularity context of likes and retweets and impressions,” and feel “intimidated” by it. Those I’ve known on Twitter who’ve had negative experiences or have otherwise felt the need to take greater control of a given moment’s interactions generally make use of the “Protect My Tweets” selection in their account’s privacy settings. (This is called “private Twitter,” in case you’re unfamiliar.) This was clearly on the minds of whoever crafted [the official Twitter Support page on Spaces](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces):

> Accounts with protected Tweets are not able to create Spaces. They are able to join and speak in other people’s Spaces, and their presence will be visible to other participants.  

I’ve been thinking a lot about this and come to the conclusion that Kayvon was speaking of a relative minority of Twitter users in his explanation, consciously or not. It’s telling that I was unable to find the statistics of an average Twitter account’s number of daily interactions, but it also means I have to make yet another supposition: even most *regular* Twitter users rarely experience an overwhelming amount of what I’ll call account-specific notifications (mentions, replies, likes, and retweets, as distinct from algorithmically-sourced content recommendations.) I could be wrong, but I would argue that only the most popular Twitter users - those most visible by way of all sorts of celebredom - are under pressure to consider “the public record.” When Kayvon explains Twitter’s interest in making Spaces ephemeral, he is speaking for the “clients” who make Twitter a (debatably) viable **business**. This should not be surprising or damning, necessarily, but only so long as it is emphasized.

https://soundcloud.com/compaqclub/twitter-spaces

Early in the interview, Nilay “reframes” the pillars of Twitter’s current development as described by Bekypour. “Health,” he observes, “is basically just the overwhelming content moderation problem that every social platform faces.” A large, most uncomfortable component of this “problem,” is just another manifestation of the age-old dynamic between celebrities and everyone else. The tools Twitter is building along this line are designed to enable the social upper class (if you will) to better manage their interactions with the masses. Abstractly, Twitter sounds like an inherently democratizing space as described to an unfamiliar party. The personal experiences with Spaces I outlined were undoubtedly democratizing *for me*, but the essence of this new direction Twitter has taken - led by the co-mastermind of what I would call the most democratized social platform of our time - is an explicit, clearer-than-ever commitment to amplify the already/otherwise amplified voices which belt the song of popular relevancy.

## Scope History in Scope
The [other important Bekypour interview](https://onezero.medium.com/the-story-behind-twitters-revival-a-conversation-with-twitter-product-head-kayvon-beykpour-d52127e31eec) comes via Alex Kantrowitz’s *Big Technology Podcast*, who is notably much less Vox media glossy than Nilay in his questions. When he asks why Spaces ended up looking so similar to Clubhouse, Bekypour responds with an revealing anecdote on Periscope’s story:

> Well, we’ve been thinking about audio for quite some time. And it’s funny, actually, the code name for the project internally is called Kaleidoscope because when we started working a year ago and winding down Periscope, we knew that there were aspects of Periscope that we wanted to live on from a use case standpoint, putting aside the technology.  

Indeed, it was under Twitter’s tenure that Periscope [first added audio-only broadcasting](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/twitter-launches-audio-only-broadcasting-feature-on-its-ios-app-and-periscope/) in September 2018, followed by [audio-only guest call-ins](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/periscopes-latest-feature-turns-your-broadcast-into-a-radio-talk-show/) in February of the next year. My occasional check-ins with the community and brief skim of the iOS app’s release notes suggest that Periscope’s technical development staff were then quickly diverted to other projects, fired, or killed. The language in the service’s self-published Medium obituary is aggravatingly avoidant of any responsibility for the state of disrepair Periscope has subsequently found itself in:

> The truth is that the Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while.  

*We have no idea how this happened! What a tragedy! Our sympathies.*

> Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time. Leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter.  

Read: News networks don’t bother to simulcast to Periscope anymore and we can’t remember the last time any sort of celebrity said something controversial enough on our platform to get pscp.tv in the news. “Nobody at the wheel” has been my recent favorite idiom to staple on software/services that have remained “on the market,” so to speak - still taking money/account signups/other contemporary manifestations of currency exchange, and yet *appear* abandoned under varying degrees of scrutiny. (Clyp.it is the most [recently relevant](https://bit.ly/enduserwhyp) example I’ve investigated.) I should disclaim that I have no idea what it’s like to work for a software company - my only *real* technology employment was for a small-time IT company. I should also disclose that my intentional exploration of the open source/open web/decentralized community since early 2018 has definitely incubated a few biases toward the abstract idealism present in their preferred methodologies. What I’m really saying: I find the whole spectrum of secrecy purveyed and practiced in the realm of proprietary software *utterly absurd*. The fact that I and others on the beat must *speculate* if we’re to discuss the history of a given app’s development in any detail is ridiculous for many reasons which are inappropriate to dive into, here.

![Unrequited Twitter Spaces Support DM](https://i.snap.as/tEvlLAkm.jpeg)

A relevant, real-world example of the sort of silly mysteriousness this attitude manifests is the process by which I gained “early” access to Twitter Spaces on my main account, [@NeoYokel](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), over the course of this writing. I noticed it’d been enabled almost exactly 24 hours after the timestamp on the DM (screenshotted above) I sent [@TwitterSpaces](https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces) from [@dieselgoth](https://twitter.com/dieselgoth) - an alt I created last year mostly to spare my longtime followers from live racing Tweet spam which was granted Spaces access first, despite having been almost 100% dormant for months. I don’t think it’d be unreasonable to assume my main account was explicitly/manually given access by a Twitter employee  as a direct result of that message, but I’ll never know for sure because it has yet to receive any response. As I [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1374639645833711616), I am far from personally up in arms because Twitter, Incorporated decided to *leave me on read*, but my young imagination conjures a million scenarios involving different sorts of people in which such a lack of acknowledgement certainly *would* be quite a deal, justifiably or not. All I’d ask is *for what reason, exactly*? 

The most essential acknowledgement I must make, though, is that the two Spaces I’ve started since gaining access received absolutely zero engagement, despite the latter being timed and labeled as optimally as I could personally manage *and* left open for more than an hour. This is in stark contrast to my early experiences on Periscope, especially, which were the heavyweights contributing to the sum of interactions throughout the history of my account, there. Of further note for context: **I garnered a more voluminous, active “following” on Periscope than I have on any other social media service** throughout the history of my internet presence. I felt it important to spell this out in the hope that this post would not become (or be regarded as) rudimentary bitching about how this story effects *me*, because it technically does - in a very specific, crucial manner - more than any other subject discussed in *The Psalms*. (If it comes across that way, or if you have any other thoughts to share, I would love nothing more than to “[hear](https://bit.ly/dbrolodex)” them and optionally add them to this post.) I would hope my work has come across as *unnecessarily* (perhaps even *aggravatingly*) transparent, this far, but it’s especially essential in this case. As I continue to cite my experiences on my Periscope/Twitter account(s,) I would also like to emphasize that I do so because 1) I don’t want to speak for anyone else and 2) I have access/control to their full documentation as well as my own permission to share it as needed, **not** because I think (or would argue) that my experience on Twitter properties, going forward, should be served or optimized for in any way. I haven’t already invested two weeks in this subject at this point for the sake of improving my own online life, but to speak for those uncomfortable with revealing their voice (regarding text chat omission in Spaces,) and to critically reflect on what Spaces’ lack of discoverability (in contrast with Periscope, particularly) might mean for all Twitter users.

While we’re this deep in the meta, let me also confess to you that I had long intended to write a thorough celebratory essay detailing my positive experiences on Periscope, but put it off too long. I’ve decided that this post shall have to take its place, so I’m therefore going to share the unedited draft of that essay from ::???::  in its entirety, now, marked by horizontal lines:

# A Good Place: Periscope Magic

![The Magic of Periscope](https://i.snap.as/3fM96uY.jpg)
## One livestreaming app has always been a fascinating, generally positive, and all around beautiful place.

In April, *The Outline* - one of my favorite Web Sites ever - [closed its virtual doors](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end/). I should be more sad about this, but since before they even launched, they never responded to a single one of my emails. I sent them words of encouragement, admiration, spelling and pronoun corrections, and even a few pitches. Some of them were pretty good ideas, but I never once heard back. I pitched this piece, in fact, for their series called "[A Good Place](https://theoutline.com/post/8423/a-good-place-symbolics-internet-history-oldest-website)," which began with the tag "the internet is too much, but this place is just right." In general, it sought the more wholesome, "positive" bits of The Web and detailed the histories of - and some pseudotheraputic uses for - its often-quaint subjects. In my experience, I have not encountered anything more appropriate and yet *mainstream* for this supposition than Periscope, the live streaming app which [Twitter bought before its independent launch](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3) that's quietly taken a place which could only be its very own.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1069117482647076865

Through this service, I have watched - and watched with - people from all over the world and met apparently lifelong friends. I've spoken to users in their first 3 weeks trying to learn English and laughed with many more who couldn't understand each other whatsoever. I've streamed out hundreds of hours of live improv piano and had conversations with folks lasting late into the night on just about everything. I have observed Martin Shkreli be a dick and popped into live interviews with celebrities at the beautiful, surreal Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Periscope is [embedded more deeply in society](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/) than one would think, considering how little it's mentioned in media.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=0_0MynsbpOo

In February 2014, [Kayvon Beykpour](https://twitter.com/kayvz) and [Joe Bernstein](https://twitter.com/joebernstein) founded Periscope with a seed round from angel investors "including Adobe executive Scott Belsky." A year later, Twitter [bought it for some $50-100 million](https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3) (not even *Business Insider* knows for sure.) The app was briefly in direct competition with [Meerkat](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/) - the since-extinct [arguably originating](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/08/the-inevitable-democratization/) service in the space.

> By building a [dead-simple broadcasting interface that piggybacks on Twitter](https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/)‘s interest graph for identity, communication, and distribution, Meerkat made the first mobile livestreaming app that “just works."

Meerkat was an important rung in the ladder, but it ultimately [died](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37555100) at the hands of Periscope due to its lack of a stream archive. "The [surprise emergence of Meerkat](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw) as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them," [reported Casey Newton for *The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8293353/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat).

> For everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks — which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail.

Periscope, by contrast, maintains an [archive of past broadcasts](https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/9/11635382/periscope-permanent-broadcasts-search-drone-integration-dji) for a significant period and allows users to [save broadcasts locally](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/save-broadcast) on their phones. We have to remember how much has changed in the past five years in mobile terms. [Dan Frommer in *Quartz*](https://qz.com/365293/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding/):

> What has changed? Almost everything. Mobile phones are faster and more powerful, with large screens capable of displaying beautiful, high-definition video. Mobile networks—where LTE service is available, at least—can now easily handle high-quality streams in both directions. Data service is frequently affordable.

In 2015-2016, I worked afternoons (3-11PM) at a grocery store gas station in a moderately-sized shopping center on the South side of Columbia, Missouri. After work, I'd sit in my old Jaguar parked in front of the laundromat (for the WiFi) chainsmoking cigarettes on Periscope, talking about anything. I found my only real following, ever there. Friends like [Juanita](https://www.pscp.tv/Jquinta) and [Nicole](https://www.pscp.tv/Nicole3) were made. [Ashers](https://www.pscp.tv/OMFGAshers) bought me a pack of cigarettes once (thank you!)

### Preservation<!-- {"fold":true} -->
Yes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Perhaps one day - assuming Twitter’s going to [stick to its word](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1374680479874568194) and maintain an indefinite archive of all currently-viewable broadcasts - I will be able to justify investing further time in digging out more of my favorite scopes from others, but for now, I have begun [a Twitter List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1374664072654958594) specifically for mutuals I met on Periscope, but it’s limited to those who have a *public* Twitter profile linked to the Periscope account I know them from. I also (sortof accidentally) uploaded the 43 video files of my own broadcasts I had in my possession (obtained with tools like Scopedown) to [a playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiI5-v1HgmCbWg_Pu-Mp0s1LTBBoVAI7A) on *Extratone*’s YouTube channel, not intending that they clog up the feed as they did.

## The Magic Left Out

Yes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Given just the exchanges I’ve had about Periscope in the past week, I suspect I would find writing its full history in non-fiction narrative form to be an incredible, desperately unique experience, just as the app has. As I write, the mobile app, itself, has five and half days left to live (before it’s removed from both the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store.) Early yesterday morning, as I opened the app to my feed, I was unable to find any recent or currently-live broadcasts which made any mention of this reality, despite spirited scrolling. The same uncanny noise of Periscope’s trademark, infinitely-wide spectrum of use continued beneath the banner embedded above, which was only *very* recently updated with The End’s specific date. It doesn’t really agitate my own personal urgency, either (if you cared to know,) because I’ve endured the luxury of existence from a perspective of such thorough latency with reality for so long that I have all but forgotten the experience of actually expecting to finish anything on time.[^1]

==Okay… So I cannot go back any further without expanding the foldout, I guess.==

(…I feel like at this point, I should have probably started another note.)

#testing

[^1]: I’ve even managed to exhaust the stage where I found my own slow pace entertaining, which is a definite first. It’s not even funny how long it takes me to do *anythihng* anymore, it’s just a fact.

if you’re *absolutely positive* you want to know more, I’ve tossed most of my findings in this GitHub issue over the past few months: https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/79

(if you’re familiar, you can also see alterations to my notes in the commits. if not, honestly I’m dissatisfied with them anyway lol)

how did Kayvon Bekpour become head of product at Twitter? well first, he built Periscope and really *believed in it*. doted on it. described it as his child. he ended up working for Twitter only because they acquired Periscope. 

regarding Periscope, I should note that I believe it was the truest representation of what we all _claim_ to desire from a social network. (it was also fundamentally a filter bubble busting device like no other.) 

so… how many years later and Periscope’s founder has ascended to product decision position #1, from which he apparently decreed (perhaps two years ago? perhaps less. listen to that Nilay interview for more deets) that the remaining Periscope team cease all development on that platform and focus on reappropriating the actual technology for a Twitter-branded, audio-only live [conference call] experience.
***
https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decoder-with-nilay-patel/id1011668648?i=1000512229112

Kayvon seems pretty darn forthcoming in that interview (I think I can listen again to clarify his language after all these months without getting too **huffy**) considering how completely unsentimental he is about cannibalizing likely the only actual innovation he’ll ever be responsible for.

 ((**sorry, I know this is long-winded, but it’s sortof necessary to understand the level of negligence I’ve witnessed from the company this year.**))

he sounds comfortable with admitting that they poached _basically_ everyone *silently* from Periscope (without mentioning anything to its tens of millions of active users until the last possible second) in order to “build” Spaces.

the thing is… I think he literally took _everyone_. as in… nobody was at the wheel of that app - even for the most basic maintenance - for ??? before they actually announced they were shutting it down. 

and what they people they *did* take to “build” Spaces from Periscope have been doing… were doing… nobody seems to have any fucking idea. I have continued to try/participate in Spaces ranging from just 1 friend and I chatting for an hour up to Casey Newton and Kara Swisher’s scheduled weekly show, and I can tell you that it is demonstrably and distinctly less reliable than Periscope had become even in its final months. 

notably, I cannot honestly say I’ve seen any improvement in Spaces’ reliability since I first started taking notes on this (the issue is stamped march 11th.) if anything, the last one i did with my one friend - which was laggy and eventually just randomly stopped (ended) - indicates it has become *less* reliable. 

***

and then there’s the thing where I’m pretty darn sure (not positive) that Twitter literally *forgot to shut Periscope off* for at least 5-10 days after the day they announced. I know because I set up a scope before I went to sleep of a long queue of old scopes/youtube videos of mine and when I woke up, it was still going. 

and then when I checked around lunch time…. it was still going….

and by bedtime of the second night, it didn’t seem like a cool way to say goodbye anymore… and I was running out of content, so I shut mine off. there were still others broadcasting for several days after that, though.

I have felt like a maniac, dwelling on Twitter’s inability even to keep to their self-imposed deadlines, and perhaps I am, but jesus christ…. I don’t know where else to start holding them accountable. https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1412958943681421315

imo tech media has got to start demanding peeks in the window to see what the fuck these people are even doing. 

# Echoes in Twitter Spaces

![Periscope Death](https://i.snap.as/1JykaVQ1.png)

## Periscope’s successor is explicitly built to silence those who are unable to or uncomfortable with using their voice.
Today, I came to a few revelations that led me to feel obligated to write about Twitter’s “new” live audio broadcasting feature, Spaces. Considering how much I read on a daily basis on media and the web, it’s quite pitiful that I would end up discovering their[]() existence as the majority of eventual users will, the app relaunching lands on the Home tab, which now features the Instagram Stories-derived Fleets gallery as the top header. I’m not sure what this looks like for the average user, but for me, it is always stocked with blue-embossed circular profile pictures - all people I followed in the decade+ before I hit my limit., but often cannot recall when or why. Suffice it to say, it’s unlikely I would easily run out of Fleets to watch if I ever find myself in a stage of obsessive Fleet consumption. Spaces only came to my attention when I happened to spot a *purple* cluster of rounded profile pictures in this menu. Naturally, I tapped immediately, and found myself in a Space run by [Matt Daniels](https://twitter.com/mygunisquick) and including [Mike Elgan](https://twitter.com/mikeelgan) as speaker. You might notice, now, following those hyperlinks, that both have the Purple Circle emoji 🟣 in front of their display names on their Profiles. They explained that it’s become a trend among those who’ve been granted Spaces access to indicate that they are testing and *discussing* Spaces.

I was lucky to happen upon this particular Space - Matt was a fairly-prolific Periscope broadcaster, and that dearest app came up in the conversation just as I was approved as a speaker to mention it. I noted that I’d heard Spaces was built atop the technology Twitter acquired from Periscope in its acquisition and cited [my recent observations](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1260074702204293121) of my own experiences on that late service, asking whether or not Spaces would eventually meet a similar fate. I’d been suggesting that Periscope was the only entirely-positive social network experience I’d ever encountered, noting that I still wasn’t instinctively compelled to open the app nearly as much as I should have been, however. Matt’s response was quite profound: as a regular and popular Periscope broadcaster, his perspective was that its fundamental problem lied in insufficient filtering of its text chat. He said that Spaces’ exclusion of that feature was an important component of its potential, along with the fundamental implications behind new guests being muted by default. I hadn’t yet figured out a method of recording Spaces (more on that in a bit,) so I would qualify my account of this conversation in a big way, but I vaguely recall Mike chiming in to relay a sentiment he’d heard from Twitter employees in another recent Space: they understood and explicitly intended to continue in the text chat-less direction because of feedback from Periscope creators like Matt.

For myself, the general praise of Spaces (and Clubhouse, adjacently) as a democratizing new social feature definitely resonates. In just that first experience, I was given the opportunity to speak directly to Matt and Mike - the later of whom I have been reading and listening to for my whole adult life. He even followed me after the Space ended. Yesterday, I happened upon a Space hosted by [Ben Popper](https://twitter.com/benpopper?s=21) - formerly one of my favorites on *The Verge*’s masthead - in which he was broadcasting [his impressively-disciplined turkey calls](https://whyp.it/t/ben-poppers-turkey-calls-46198) from “a shed in the woods.” He approved me as speaker immediately and was incredibly accommodating of my questions about his former colleagues and  recent life events. (He’s now living “rurally” and working as Director of Content at Stack Overflow - neither of which I would have ever expected.)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZH-SHzE8XQ

Yet another former *Verge* staffer, [Sam Scheffer](https://twitter.com/samsheffer), has been the most active Spaces user on my Timeline. Notably, he is one of the only Twitter Tech Media folks I know who has continued to be honest with himself and the world about his feelings about the service. Among a crop of people who once exclaimed shit like “I *love* Twitter” and “I *live* on Twitter,” his singular continued use of such terms reflects something significant, I think. Understandably given Tump Hell, it is now very popular to lament Twitter whenever possible, even among those who’s volume of use has not changed in any measurable way. I don’t think it’s reaching to say that Sam and I are alike in our desire to try out whatever we’re tossed the keys to in as extreme a degree as possible. I’ve stopped by a handful of his Spaces - which are often also about Spaces, itself. Most recently however, he approved me to speak in a Space including a host of Silicon Valley folk and at least one Microsoft employee, talking about the future of AR and VR, vaguely in response to Microsoft’s Ignite event, which legitimately disturbed me.

https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1366804088629919744

I probably waited too long to speak up, until he was trying to wrap up the Space - but I did chime in about the way the Ignite keynote made me feel and attempted to convey the contrast between the goals of the tech industry and the general attitudes toward AR and VR present in the Midwesterners around me. Essentially, I was granted yet another unique *opportunity* to ask a question that’s been bothering me for years, now: *what the fuck are you doing and why???* It was the Microsoft Man (I can’t find his account, now, sorry) who responded very promptly, considering, with an explanation that actually made a lot of sense. The gist of it was *we are contending with the idea that we may never work in an office again, and these technologies offer a difficult-to-explain amends*. He specifically used the term “fatigue” in describing his own experiences trying to collaborate remotely and reflected on the benefits of virtual context on the most elemental, sensory components of interaction throughout a workday. From that ~45 second response, I feel as though I gained more understanding than I have from years of reading on my own, which further reinforces his observations, in retrospect.

Already, it would seem Twitter Spaces might have a lot to offer David Blue, going forward. Though I signed up for Clubhouse’s waiting list last year (twice, in fact, but please don’t tell on me,) I have yet to hear back from them. If I was a bitter person, I would be up in arms about this, citing the fact that I would probably contribute more to the wellbeing of the project, technically, than 90% of those who’ve been invited. (I am the physical manifestation of the *Stress Test*, and I spend an absurd amount of time on beta feedback, [even on software *I’m fucking paying for*](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1362822335041048577).) From what I originally heard, though, Clubhouse was showing real promise as a space where creators of color felt in control of their experience. I hope this has continued to be true and - if it has - I say *never* invite me.

## The Social and The Socialites
Crucially, though, enabling [my tech bro ass](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1370838780333146118) to engage with famous tech bros about tech bro shit is never going to justifiably occupy anyone’s list of priorities in my lifetime (including my own.) The original promise of the internet did not include amplification of voices already/otherwise at max volume. Instead, it was using technology to deliver new, varying, and universally-empowering tools of expression to those who’d been minimized for all of human history. It didn’t have to be philanthropic - in fact, it was and shall always remain in the best interest of the loudest folks to hear from the other side of the spectrum. The possibilities of this dynamic should be *thrilling* to all involved, and it used to be for Twitter, Inc. Or so it seemed, anyway. As the company has honed its various loglines over the years, their actions have reflected their truth less and less.

Coincidentally, the most visible co-founder of Periscope, [Kayvon Beykpour](https://twitter.com/kayvz), is now Twitter’s Head of Consumer product, and he spent this past week doing interviews about Twitter’s late feature frenzy. I want to share two very different podcast episodes with two very different interviewers. [Nilay Patel’s *Decoder* interview](https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder) should probably be first priority as the more comprehensive and digestible of the two.

> We started it from the standpoint of “why are people not tweeting?” It turns out that some of the reasons they’re not tweeting is they don’t feel safe. They don’t feel safe because what they tweet is subject to public scrutiny. Tweets are on the public record, which is terrifying. Anyone can respond to them, and they’re such a popularity contest of likes and retweets and impressions and all of the social mechanics that we’ve built in the product that actually work quite well for a certain purpose, but can work against you if you’re just trying to have a conversation and feel intimidated by that.   

“Why are people not tweeting” justifies us taking a moment to indulge some hilarity: imagine Jack and his hellbeard wandering around the abandoned Twitter office screaming that question at the walls, over and over again. Bekypour’s decision to identify one’s “on the public record” Tweets as “terrifying” could easily be tossed back at the company in the center of a dense globule of shit, but one imagines it’d hardly be constructive. I’m going to take my furthest leap here and suggest that we examine who exactly Kayvon was considering - those who find on Twitter a “popularity context of likes and retweets and impressions,” and feel “intimidated” by it. Those I’ve known on Twitter who’ve had negative experiences or have otherwise felt the need to take greater control of a given moment’s interactions generally make use of the “Protect My Tweets” selection in their account’s privacy settings. (This is called “private Twitter,” in case you’re unfamiliar.) This was clearly on the minds of whoever crafted [the official Twitter Support page on Spaces](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/spaces):

> Accounts with protected Tweets are not able to create Spaces. They are able to join and speak in other people’s Spaces, and their presence will be visible to other participants.  

I’ve been thinking a lot about this and come to the conclusion that Kayvon was speaking of a relative minority of Twitter users in his explanation, consciously or not. It’s telling that I was unable to find the statistics of an average Twitter account’s number of daily interactions, but it also means I have to make yet another supposition: even most *regular* Twitter users rarely experience an overwhelming amount of what I’ll call account-specific notifications (mentions, replies, likes, and retweets, as distinct from algorithmically-sourced content recommendations.) I could be wrong, but I would argue that only the most popular Twitter users - those most visible by way of all sorts of celebredom - are under pressure to consider “the public record.” When Kayvon explains Twitter’s interest in making Spaces ephemeral, he is speaking for the “clients” who make Twitter a (debatably) viable **business**. This should not be surprising or damning, necessarily, but only so long as it is emphasized.

https://soundcloud.com/compaqclub/twitter-spaces

Early in the interview, Nilay “reframes” the pillars of Twitter’s current development as described by Bekypour. “Health,” he observes, “is basically just the overwhelming content moderation problem that every social platform faces.” A large, most uncomfortable component of this “problem,” is just another manifestation of the age-old dynamic between celebrities and everyone else. The tools Twitter is building along this line are designed to enable the social upper class (if you will) to better manage their interactions with the masses. Abstractly, Twitter sounds like an inherently democratizing space as described to an unfamiliar party. The personal experiences with Spaces I outlined were undoubtedly democratizing *for me*, but the essence of this new direction Twitter has taken - led by the co-mastermind of what I would call the most democratized social platform of our time - is an explicit, clearer-than-ever commitment to amplify the already/otherwise amplified voices which belt the song of popular relevancy.

## Scope History in Scope
The [other important Bekypour interview](https://onezero.medium.com/the-story-behind-twitters-revival-a-conversation-with-twitter-product-head-kayvon-beykpour-d52127e31eec) comes via Alex Kantrowitz’s *Big Technology Podcast*, who is notably much less Vox media glossy than Nilay in his questions. When he asks why Spaces ended up looking so similar to Clubhouse, Bekypour responds with an revealing anecdote on Periscope’s story:

> Well, we’ve been thinking about audio for quite some time. And it’s funny, actually, the code name for the project internally is called Kaleidoscope because when we started working a year ago and winding down Periscope, we knew that there were aspects of Periscope that we wanted to live on from a use case standpoint, putting aside the technology.  

Indeed, it was under Twitter’s tenure that Periscope [first added audio-only broadcasting](https://techcrunch.com/2018/09/07/twitter-launches-audio-only-broadcasting-feature-on-its-ios-app-and-periscope/) in September 2018, followed by [audio-only guest call-ins](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/04/periscopes-latest-feature-turns-your-broadcast-into-a-radio-talk-show/) in February of the next year. My occasional check-ins with the community and brief skim of the iOS app’s release notes suggest that Periscope’s technical development staff were then quickly diverted to other projects, fired, or killed. The language in the service’s self-published Medium obituary is aggravatingly avoidant of any responsibility for the state of disrepair Periscope has subsequently found itself in:

> The truth is that the Periscope app is in an unsustainable maintenance-mode state, and has been for a while.  

*We have no idea how this happened! What a tragedy! Our sympathies.*

> Over the past couple of years, we’ve seen declining usage and know that the cost to support the app will only continue to go up over time. Leaving it in its current state isn’t doing right by the current and former Periscope community or by Twitter.  

Read: News networks don’t bother to simulcast to Periscope anymore and we can’t remember the last time any sort of celebrity said something controversial enough on our platform to get pscp.tv in the news. “Nobody at the wheel” has been my recent favorite idiom to staple on software/services that have remained “on the market,” so to speak - still taking money/account signups/other contemporary manifestations of currency exchange, and yet *appear* abandoned under varying degrees of scrutiny. (Clyp.it is the most [recently relevant](https://bit.ly/enduserwhyp) example I’ve investigated.) I should disclaim that I have no idea what it’s like to work for a software company - my only *real* technology employment was for a small-time IT company. I should also disclose that my intentional exploration of the open source/open web/decentralized community since early 2018 has definitely incubated a few biases toward the abstract idealism present in their preferred methodologies. What I’m really saying: I find the whole spectrum of secrecy purveyed and practiced in the realm of proprietary software *utterly absurd*. The fact that I and others on the beat must *speculate* if we’re to discuss the history of a given app’s development in any detail is ridiculous for many reasons which are inappropriate to dive into, here.

![Unrequited Twitter Spaces Support DM](https://i.snap.as/tEvlLAkm.jpeg)

A relevant, real-world example of the sort of silly mysteriousness this attitude manifests is the process by which I gained “early” access to Twitter Spaces on my main account, [@NeoYokel](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), over the course of this writing. I noticed it’d been enabled almost exactly 24 hours after the timestamp on the DM (screenshotted above) I sent [@TwitterSpaces](https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces) from [@dieselgoth](https://twitter.com/dieselgoth) - an alt I created last year mostly to spare my longtime followers from live racing Tweet spam which was granted Spaces access first, despite having been almost 100% dormant for months. I don’t think it’d be unreasonable to assume my main account was explicitly/manually given access by a Twitter employee  as a direct result of that message, but I’ll never know for sure because it has yet to receive any response. As I [Tweeted](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1374639645833711616), I am far from personally up in arms because Twitter, Incorporated decided to *leave me on read*, but my young imagination conjures a million scenarios involving different sorts of people in which such a lack of acknowledgement certainly *would* be quite a deal, justifiably or not. All I’d ask is *for what reason, exactly*? 

The most essential acknowledgement I must make, though, is that the two Spaces I’ve started since gaining access received absolutely zero engagement, despite the latter being timed and labeled as optimally as I could personally manage *and* left open for more than an hour. This is in stark contrast to my early experiences on Periscope, especially, which were the heavyweights contributing to the sum of interactions throughout the history of my account, there. Of further note for context: **I garnered a more voluminous, active “following” on Periscope than I have on any other social media service** throughout the history of my internet presence. I felt it important to spell this out in the hope that this post would not become (or be regarded as) rudimentary bitching about how this story effects *me*, because it technically does - in a very specific, crucial manner - more than any other subject discussed in *The Psalms*. (If it comes across that way, or if you have any other thoughts to share, I would love nothing more than to “[hear](https://bit.ly/dbrolodex)” them and optionally add them to this post.) I would hope my work has come across as *unnecessarily* (perhaps even *aggravatingly*) transparent, this far, but it’s especially essential in this case. As I continue to cite my experiences on my Periscope/Twitter account(s,) I would also like to emphasize that I do so because 1) I don’t want to speak for anyone else and 2) I have access/control to their full documentation as well as my own permission to share it as needed, **not** because I think (or would argue) that my experience on Twitter properties, going forward, should be served or optimized for in any way. I haven’t already invested two weeks in this subject at this point for the sake of improving my own online life, but to speak for those uncomfortable with revealing their voice (regarding text chat omission in Spaces,) and to critically reflect on what Spaces’ lack of discoverability (in contrast with Periscope, particularly) might mean for all Twitter users.

While we’re this deep in the meta, let me also confess to you that I had long intended to write a thorough celebratory essay detailing my positive experiences on Periscope, but put it off too long. I’ve decided that this post shall have to take its place, so I’m therefore going to share the unedited draft of that essay from ::???::  in its entirety, now, marked by horizontal lines:

## One livestreaming app has always been a fascinating, generally positive, and all around beautiful place.

In April, *The Outline* - one of my favorite Web Sites ever - [closed its virtual doors](https://www.niemanlab.org/2020/04/the-outline-an-attempt-to-build-a-bolder-kind-of-news-site-appears-to-have-met-its-end/). I should be more sad about this, but since before they even launched, they never responded to a single one of my emails. I sent them words of encouragement, admiration, spelling and pronoun corrections, and even a few pitches. Some of them were pretty good ideas, but I never once heard back. I pitched this piece, in fact, for their series called "[A Good Place](https://theoutline.com/post/8423/a-good-place-symbolics-internet-history-oldest-website)," which began with the tag "the internet is too much, but this place is just right." In general, it sought the more wholesome, "positive" bits of The Web and detailed the histories of - and some pseudotheraputic uses for - its often-quaint subjects. In my experience, I have not encountered anything more appropriate and yet *mainstream* for this supposition than Periscope, the live streaming app which [Twitter bought before its independent launch](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-periscope-and-why-twitter-bought-it-2015-3) that's quietly taken a place which could only be its very own.

Through this service, I have watched - and watched with - people from all over the world and met apparently lifelong friends. I've spoken to users in their first 3 weeks trying to learn English and laughed with many more who couldn't understand each other whatsoever. I've streamed out hundreds of hours of live improv piano and had conversations with folks lasting late into the night on just about everything. I have observed Martin Shkreli be a dick and popped into live interviews with celebrities at the beautiful, surreal Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance. Periscope is [embedded more deeply in society](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/) than one would think, considering how little it's mentioned in media.

In February 2014, [Kayvon Beykpour](https://twitter.com/kayvz) and [Joe Bernstein](https://twitter.com/joebernstein) founded Periscope with a seed round from angel investors "including Adobe executive Scott Belsky." A year later, Twitter [bought it for some $50-100 million](https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-acquires-periscope-for-a-sizable-amount-2015-3) (not even *Business Insider* knows for sure.) The app was briefly in direct competition with [Meerkat](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/) - the since-extinct [arguably originating](https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/08/the-inevitable-democratization/) service in the space.

> By building a [dead-simple broadcasting interface that piggybacks on Twitter](https://beta.techcrunch.com/2015/03/01/meerkat/)‘s interest graph for identity, communication, and distribution, Meerkat made the first mobile livestreaming app that “just works."

Meerkat was an important rung in the ladder, but it ultimately [died](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37555100) at the hands of Periscope due to its lack of a stream archive. "The [surprise emergence of Meerkat](http://www.theverge.com/2015/3/17/8234769/how-meerkat-conquered-all-at-sxsw) as a social phenomenon this year has been accompanied by a frequent complaint: the links are usually dead by the time you click them," [reported Casey Newton for *The Verge*](https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/26/8293353/periscope-live-streaming-twitter-meerkat).

> For everything it got right, Meerkat still looks like an app built in eight weeks — which it was. Periscope has been in development for more than a year, and the app arrives showing nice attention to detail.

Periscope, by contrast, maintains an [archive of past broadcasts](https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/9/11635382/periscope-permanent-broadcasts-search-drone-integration-dji) for a significant period and allows users to [save broadcasts locally](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/save-broadcast) on their phones. We have to remember how much has changed in the past five years in mobile terms. [Dan Frommer in *Quartz*](https://qz.com/365293/it-took-a-decade-but-mobile-video-is-finally-exploding/):

> What has changed? Almost everything. Mobile phones are faster and more powerful, with large screens capable of displaying beautiful, high-definition video. Mobile networks—where LTE service is available, at least—can now easily handle high-quality streams in both directions. Data service is frequently affordable.

In 2015-2016, I worked afternoons (3-11PM) at a grocery store gas station in a moderately-sized shopping center on the South side of Columbia, Missouri. After work, I'd sit in my old Jaguar parked in front of the laundromat (for the WiFi) chainsmoking cigarettes on Periscope, talking about anything. I found my only real following, ever there. Friends like [Juanita](https://www.pscp.tv/Jquinta) and [Nicole](https://www.pscp.tv/Nicole3) were made. [Ashers](https://www.pscp.tv/OMFGAshers) bought me a pack of cigarettes once (thank you!)

### Preservation
Yes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Perhaps one day - assuming Twitter’s going to [stick to its word](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1374680479874568194) and maintain an indefinite archive of all currently-viewable broadcasts - I will be able to justify investing further time in digging out more of my favorite scopes from others, but for now, I have begun [a Twitter List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1374664072654958594) specifically for mutuals I met on Periscope, but it’s limited to those who have a *public* Twitter profile linked to the Periscope account I know them from. I also (sortof accidentally) uploaded the 43 video files of my own broadcasts I had in my possession (obtained with tools like Scopedown) to [a playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLiI5-v1HgmCbWg_Pu-Mp0s1LTBBoVAI7A) on *Extratone*’s YouTube channel, not intending that they clog up the feed as they did.

## The Magic Left Out

Yes, that’s where I stopped on June 14th of last year. Given just the exchanges I’ve had about Periscope in the past week, I suspect I would find writing its full history in non-fiction narrative form to be an incredible, desperately unique experience, just as the app has. As I write, the mobile app, itself, has five and half days left to live (before it’s removed from both the Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store.) Early yesterday morning, as I opened the app to my feed, I was unable to find any recent or currently-live broadcasts which made any mention of this reality, despite spirited scrolling. The same uncanny noise of Periscope’s trademark, infinitely-wide spectrum of use continued beneath the banner embedded above, which was only *very* recently updated with The End’s specific date. It doesn’t really agitate my own personal urgency, either (if you cared to know,) because I’ve endured the luxury of existence from a perspective of such thorough latency with reality for so long that I have all but forgotten the experience of actually expecting to finish anything on time.[^1]

[^1]: I’ve even managed to exhaust the stage where I found my own slow pace entertaining, which is a definite first. It’s not even funny how long it takes me to do *anythihng* anymore, it’s just a fact.**
# On the Future of the Respected Audience
`April 10, 2017`

***
_The following was sent as part of a __[personal TinyLetter_](https://tinyletter.com/DavidBlue)_  I've just begun in the hopes of rejuvenating my ability to tell stories._

There are a few entities which continue to validate what I'm pursuing, but [Joshua Topolsky](https://twitter.com/joshuatopolsky) and his _[Outline_](https://theoutline.com/) are particularly worth noting. In search of reassurance, I listened to a [podcast](https://digiday.com/podcast/outlines-josh-topolsky-theres-much-sameness-digital-media/) he appeared on in February, last night, and also found [one](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-27-joshua-topolsky) from 2013, when he was still EiC of _The Verge_. Basically the entirety of the first is within the idealism I've risked most of myself for, in case you're curious. I've looked up to Topolsky in a huge way, this past year. He has done - and is doing - many things which I am intrinsically drawn to earn for my legacy, and the presence of his wife on his staff (their few [podcasts](https://soundcloud.com/tomorrowpodcast/episode-28-laura-june-and-the-contrarian-disposition) together are adorable in a very particular way,) is idyllic in appearance, at least. I love the way they talk about each other. I suppose spousal editorial staff is probably the personal hell of a good many people. Perhaps, it's even my own. Listening to him talk on Digiday, though, reminded me - along with a few other works I've consumed lately - that _technically_, _Extratone_ is a _business._ Or at least... That it must become one eventually or die forever. While trying to explain my future plans to a friend, I inadvertently layed out some 'steps for growth.' 

  1. **Form and activate the community.**
  2. **Build a beautiful, one-of-a-kind method of content delivery.**
  3. **Attain a fairly dependable content cadence.**
  4. **Sell the product in a way that immediately and - from then on - consistently ensures and/or furthers its quality.**

I guess we're somewhere between 2 and 3 right now. I'm still building a body of written work more or less on my own, which is okay, considering that nobody is paid. I suppose it'd be most desirable - before I move to the Northwest - to figure out how to make _The Tone_ as much of a learning experience for my closest staff as possible. And regardless of all other external goals of the magazine, I think it is more than safe to say that I've learned more in the past 10 months from a fucking WordPress website than I would've if I'd spent that time at the Journalism school. The first annual renewal payment for extratone dot com just went through, actually. A year ago, I was _much_  more entertaining, but virtually directionless. I honestly can't tell if I feel any better internally, day-to-day, but I know I am at least attaining the capability of real friendship for the first time in my life, and I suppose that's more than worth losing virtually all of my engagement on Twitter. 

 Perhaps its even worth losing a portion of the freshness in my perspective - the stuff I thought made it worth it in the first place. Especially if my staff maintains it healthily within their own.

I'll admit that - in retrospect, after spending a year reading, writing, and digitally fussing - a lot of my original content smells like edgy nonsense. Some of the work within our network does too, honestly, but it's usually much less so.

Of course, that transition required an excruciating crucible, for me, but that's exactly why I'm incessantly compelled to make as much use of my trauma as possible: so that my friends and staff may be able make progress toward more fulfilling lives without such a massive up-front cost.

As I was writing my [interview with mastodon's creator](https://bit.ly/hellbird), I kept an eye out for related coverage, and eventually saw what _[PCMag_](http://www.pcmag.com/article/352875/what-is-mastodon-and-will-it-kill-twitter) did, and it's unwanted rant-spuringly aggravating language.

For most of my adult life, I've been trying to figure out why publications like _PCMag_ feel it necessary to belittle their audience _and_ their subjects to such a degree. Silicon Alley can't possibly be _that_ vapid as to nix all soul in any story, ever.

I mean... _**[What in the hell is this**_](http://gallery.tinyletterapp.com/e8ecb4f78686444d5a5c89d53c49de7c8feb8ac5/images/f15ad2c3-dbd3-4697-9c37-b4d97f260dd8.png), even??????

I haven't been a reader since I used to loiter in Barnes & Noble with a pile of print editions in the oughts, but this sort of layout has got to be some kind of **digital sin.**

I'm not going to bother digging through the publication to compare this work with others for the moment. Perhaps one day, I'll feel the need to polish this rant into an argument and make it more visible. Surely, though, the proximity of this abomination to the word _Mag_ or even _Magazine_ must keep _somebody_ awake at night.

That's not to say it doesn't take some sort of discipline. I doubt I could write in this way without hulking hyper-deliberately over _wherever the fuck this dialect comes from._ I think it's almost certainly more efficient as an informative device than my piece, or [Sarah Jeong's](https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/mastodon-is-like-twitter-without-nazis-so-why-are-we-not-using-it), but the assumption that readers would be so disinterested as to hesitate to even commit to _complete sentences_ regarding something _actually_ newsworthy for a technology publication should be taken personally.

_(This is going to echo what Topolsky said in both of those podcasts in big ways, but I'll try to keep it relatively brief.)_

**I believe there is an audience that is craving attention to detail in their stories, a more intimate, longer-lasting, and more invested relationship with a much smaller number of publications. **

Even a sense of involvement in the process. It's probably a direct result of my longtime consumption of car magazines - most of which still have sizable sections dedicated to direct, public correspondence with readers. It's also cross-platform to a surreal degree. Auto journalists of all tiers will straight up engage with you on Twitter. (_MotorTrend_ literally prints YouTube comments.)

Sure, the readership is old, and the topic is an outlier (it's fairly common knowledge that 'car people' are waaaay more vulnerable to obsession than other special interest communities,) but the species is more or less the same, and the results are plain as day, any time you care to look. In recently returning my attention to technology journalism, I've noticed an irritating affront to meta conversation with strangers. My theory is that they've been paid for their words so long that they develop a very particular greed towards them, which is why academic journalism institutes are immediately shunned by their alumni after graduation until they are definitely Too Tired to sling copy and begin to climb sortof diagonally through editorial titles until they are stashed away in some hole. Then, after ruminating until their first encounter with Actual Death - if they're still interested in the whole thing - they crawl out to be propped up in front of moderately sized bodies of petrified students to scream in 100% bitterness about _The Ethics_ that plagued them spiritually and financially their entire career at the acolytes as their last joke on the world.

But they won't engage with strangers on Twitter.

As someone who - for better or worse - chose to sidestep the academic route, I will never advocate for any value in withholding information - especially funny stories - about _Extratone_'s operation. If anything, _rediscovering relevance_ is a wholly meta pillar of our editorial bent. (Hence, why Tim calls us _The Nieman Lab of Community College._)

I also believe the subscriber & advertising revenue models are _directly_ \- if not _primarily_ \- involved in the constriction of conversations regarding a publication's operation. It's my goal to cultivate a group of subscribers that are directly invested in the product (there's another new word on my part) financially, intellectually, and emotionally. It's not exactly unheard of, ya know.

_Anywho_, I'm going to leave you in peace for now. I've really enjoyed this wanton spewing of conjecture, but then... who doesn't love to go on, unchecked?

Is _this_ what blogging is? It's fucking obnoxious.

Thank you for reading and _beware the fucking egg_,

# The State of Mastodon iOS Apps

![Mastodon iOS Apps Surveyed](https://i.snap.as/3q29AwpI.png)

## A safari through the enchanting space of third-party Mastodon clients on iOS.

Apple's second virtual World Wide Developer Conference came and went as I wrote this guide - you can metaphorically picture me looking up from my machine having overheard the news of the [2021 Apple Design Award Winners](https://developer.apple.com/design/awards/) announcement. Perusing through them, I saw two I would have voted for, myself: [CARROT Weather](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/carrot-weather/id961390574) - the [beautifully vulgar](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1368223231111557125), grumpy bitch frontend for your preferred weather information service, and [Craft](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/craft-docs-and-notes-editor/id1487937127) - perhaps the most innovative take on word processing of the past two or three years - listed under "Finalists." (Read: losers.) The most positive personal discovery of (all?) WWDCs: an app called [**Be My Eyes**](https://www.bemyeyes.com/), which "connects blind and low-vision people with sighted volunteers and company representatives for visual assistance through a live video call," along with an exceptionally crafted, cross-device accessible-as-fuck TTS solution called [Voice Dream Reader](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-dream-reader/id496177674). *However*, a double take in games from *Genshin Impact* and [the fucking *League of Legends* game](https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/league-of-legends-wild-rift/id1480616990) certainly sours the mouth and suggests yet further just how much Apple, Inc. has *sold out*. 

The continued prioritization of Growth for Growth's sake over any and all other considerations (namely, users,) is not unexpected from even the most valuable company in the history of the world, I suppose, but there *is* an actor at this point in the story who is catastrophically and demonstrably failing to fulfill their role: all I really know is that technology media has fallen into a trough of total uselessness when it comes to qualitative, authoritative analysis of consumer-targeted software. The necessity of this guide - and the bizarrely silent ignorance of even the "fringes" on its subject - is unimaginably severe. Before me has been (for years, now,) the "answer" to a Jolly Big Load of what tech and marketing types lament in more and more existential language, yet *hardly any* of the humans with the most to lose from  their negligence - regular, casual social media users - have been delivered to these experiences. The story is not being articulated. **The journalism is not being done.**

I know you almost certainly did not arrive here to hear one motherfucker's complaints about WWDC, but - as with everything Apple, Inc. does - every morsel of curatorial expression/discrimination/favoritism from The Great Money God within this platform *must* be scrutinized and criticized. Quite frankly, I found myself completely at a loss as to how *not* to dwell on the Discovery Disparity, here. 

Despite how deeply I've gone into iOS this year, I do not believe myself to be a qualified judge of software design, but I no longer believe Apple to be, either. Regardless of the revenue-related controversies of late, Apple have simply become terrible stewards of the App Store in every imaginable sense. Scams and blatant intellectual property theft abound, while the majority of the most innovative entries I've ever seen remain entirely obfuscated and uncelebrated by all of Apple. Inc.'s mechanisms. If you required an explanation for the amount of time I've invested into App Guides - a space to which I never would have imagined intentionally bringing *The Psalms* - I hope you can understand.

I must confess: I have been _meaning_ to write this app guide since even before I [interviewed Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview) on the morning of his Big Press Day, just over 4 years ago. I’ve exhaustively explored different means of convincing my own longtime Twitter friends to move, over that time, with very little success. Eugen, himself, published an [official blog post](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2021/02/developing-an-official-ios-app-for-mastodon/) at the beginning of February detailing his plans to open up onboarding by way of “an official Mastodon app that is free to download and that is specialized in helping new users get started on the platform.” As a Patreon supporter of [The Mastodon Project](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon) (full disclosure,) I've been testing this app (see preview shots at the very end,) and am quite smitten with it. That said, I thought it might be worth going over the third-party options iOS users currently have available to them, largely because the offerings are each innovative and mature applications in their own right. (Also, it’s become quite apparent that the normal tech media sources you’d go to for such a guide aren’t going to give Mastodon the attention it deserves.)

![Masto Mascot iOS Art](https://i.snap.as/Y624NGHM.jpg)

## Obligatory(?) Context

I originally intended to be as clinical as possible in this Post, having realized its potential as the singular comparison of its kind to appear in search results for new and potential users of Mastodon. From my perspective, Mastodon has long since surpassed regard as a novel social media experiment who's function is to prompt academic conversations about decentralization, open source, ad tech, and federated social's solutions to all of the Big Web's Big Boy (proprietary) Problems (though I have been compelled to [invest significantly](https://github.com/extratone/bigblue) in that very conversation.) In the less intellectual hours of my day-to-day life (read: most of the time,) Mastodon is nothing more or less than my favorite place on the internet. It is a relentless delight which I only lament because I want to share so much of it with my friends, but have continued to fail in my efforts to articulate that **Mastodon is not a compromise; it is a better social space**.

If you didn't know, this seems to have become *my general shit*, for lack of a better term: the ethical considerations of open source/"alternative" software are very important, yes! ... but they are *far* from the whole, and they are not a requisite for new users. The second of [this World Wide Web Blog's fundamental considerations](https://bilge.world/about), in fact:

> The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their *brand image* (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important contributions from the average user. **Technology media has failed in their responsibility to address this issue.**

The blog on which you're reading this, in fact, is federated on [ActivityPub](https://activitypub.rocks/). If you so chose, you could be reading it in any client capable of displaying large bodies of text. The crucial point, though, is that *you didn't need to know that* - you could very well go on reading it on the web in total ignorance/apathy regarding Federation.

*Oh boy, here we go...* No. I did not want to say anything ideological - I wanted this Post to function as little more than a pretty screenshot showcase and simple associative list responding to all of the Reddit posts I've seen to the tune of "is there an iPhone app?" As I explored them, however, I was reminded of the sheer creativity the "alternative" software community is capable of. Even the roughest of these considered apps seem unable to be faceless - sorting through the obscene amount of (unlabeled) screenshots accumulated over the past weeks of testing in my Recents folder has been *so* much easier than I thought it would be because of their relentless originality. If you've actually used any iOS applications and/or browsed the singular App Store from which they can be acquired in the past 3-4 years, you're undoubtedly skeptical: what we might have called "feature overlap"  at one time has become all but the platform's core ethos. If you're the sort who enjoys screwing around with apps, generally, as I have for the whole of iPhone history, you have grown accustomed to disappointment.

Regardless of who is to blame, we can all agree that the App Store is currently oversaturated nigh *beyond usability* with mediocre entries built from the beginning with zero apparent ambition toward original function. This, alone, wouldn't be so problematic if Discovery were not so [completely and totally Fucked](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1379068906917224448) (except when [dev-facing](https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/),) but I needn't comment further on that subject at the moment - I'm just trying emphasize how absolutely unheard of it is for a single protocol/service's third-party client representation on iOS to be so thoroughly special. It was astonishing to find all but one or two of these apps *in a functional state*, actually. In all my equivalent experiences downloading the entirety of a given service's API-supported palette (e.g. IRC apps, [topically](https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkbgvg/major-internet-projects-are-leaving-freenode-after-korean-prince-takeover),) an all-too-significant purpose of whatever ends up getting published is simply documenting the ~20% of available titles that *actually work* at the given moment. (I'd have mentioned the "best [service/task] iPhone apps for [year]" listicles found in online publications like *Digital Trends* were it not for the percentage of them in which it's clear the author *did not actually download* some/most of the apps listed‽‽‽) Perhaps due to [iOS 14.5's implementation of ATT](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/joanna-stern-personal-technology/apple-software-chief-explains-ios-145-defends-companys-reach-exclusive/57D138E3-3677-4A78-9534-62DAD443FE97), all of the Mastodon apps I could find and test (not counting non-English language-supporting apps, in fairness' interest) are currently functioning.

So, if there's virtually zero chance a new Mastodon user might download one of the apps we're about to consider and find it broken, what practical function remains for this guide? Hopefully, to establish a SEO catch-all for such users from a non-automated source less associated with the project than the official apps list. Those for whom Mastodon is still an unfamiliar subject should find the collected imagery intriguing, hopefully.

## The Big 6

My first step in writing this guide was to post [a thread on r/Mastodon](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/mxymr1/your_thoughts_on_thirdparty_mastodon_clients_for/) soliciting thoughts on third-party Mastodon apps from other users, who expressed a lot of love for Toot! and Metatext:

> Toot is just a joy to use. It has a little too much sometimes (it actually contains little mini games...which really aren't needed), but the experience of using it has some really clever UI twists. -[u/mikepictor](https://www.reddit.com/user/mikepictor/)

Pragmatic Code's [Linky](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/linky-for-twitter-and-mastodon/id438090426) was also mentioned by multiple respondents. It's not a client, but a bridging tool for smoother URL sharing that integrates with iOS' share sheet. I did not have time to try it, myself, but from all accounts, it is an obligatory mention. So too is the [**GitHub Repository/List**](https://github.com/extratone/FediiOS) I created in order to "formally" offer a list with much greater brevity and zero editorialization.

First, let’s begin with The Big 6 - those apps The Mastodon Project, itself, has seen fit to [list on joinmastodon.org](https://joinmastodon.org/apps).

https://youtube.com/watch?v=LdBFMibyh3Y

### [Toot!](https://apps.apple.com/app/toot/id1229021451)

Dag Ågren‘s [Toot!](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451) is not only my personal app of choice - I would (and have) go so far as to say it’s the single most innovative mobile social app I’ve ever encountered, largely because of its jacknife-esque instance selection. It’s held a place in my phone’s dock since the day I first downloaded it, for this and many other reasons. While one might find bugs/loose ends (understandably) exploring the functions of other indie social clients, within Toot!, they will only find little delights, like [its wholly unique Share Sheet interface](https://imgur.com/gallery/xAXs95J).

![Toot! Themes](https://i.snap.as/bXG5SAUv.png)

Toot! is extremely beautiful (despite its unfortunate name,) and I am quite superficial in my taste. It’s Obsidian theme (which may or may not be related to the topical notetaking system of the same name) is especially gorgeous.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/Toot!%20Custom%20Sounds.mp3">
</audio>

In my [cacophonous attempt](https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/106302686196643266) to compare the notifications of all available Mastodon apps simultaneously, it's worth noting that Toot!'s always came first. Its [charming custom audio alerts](https://whyp.it/t/toot-ios-app-custom-sounds-92997) also make them my favorite by far.

They're not just cute: in reflection informed by a newly-considered function of these apps - serving as representing the network as a whole - it occurred to me that **Toot! audio alerts playing from my iPhone have prompted more first-time conversations about Mastodon in the wild than I can count**. (Seriously: they should be considered an onboarding mechanism.)

![Toot! Settings](https://i.snap.as/30YJR456.png)

In my experience, it’s also the most robust of the lot - as in, it is very much the exception rather than the norm to encounter any sort of error or other obstruction in normal, day-to-day use. My own real reservation applies to the entire selection discussed today: I wish Toot! supported Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts.

![Mast for iOS](https://i.snap.as/KF4Slx39.png)

### [Mast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129)

I originally had high hopes for Shihab Mehboob‘s [Mast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mast-for-mastodon/id1437429129) - which used to look very different from the way it does, today. That’s almost certainly to do with its ownership [changing hands](https://twitter.com/jpeguin/status/1354854403124178947) at some point (no, I do not have any further details on that story, unfortunately.) That’s not to say the current app isn’t a worthwhile offering, it’s just far less _visually ambitious_ than the original I remember. However, it’s also significantly more reliable.

https://twitter.com/JPEGuin/status/1354854403124178947

![Mast Details](https://i.snap.as/UsH95qJv.png)

![Amaroq for iOS](https://i.snap.as/JV5vzmky.png)

### [Amaroq](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amarok-for-mastodon/id1214116200)

The Original… Genesis… If Amaroq was not the first Mastodon app on the App Store, it’s certainly the oldest to survive. Its GitHub Repository’s [first commit](https://github.com/ReticentJohn/Amaroq/commit/9648ebdecf8ab20819ba10fe18b6317a8026fd86) dates back to April 17th, 2017.  While you’re there, you might note that it’s the only one of these entries coded entirely in Objective-C - the near-40-year-old language originally underpinning iOS before Swift’s birth in 2014. Amaroq was the first Mastodon app I used and remains the strongest free option for iOS users. It’s been nearly a year since its last update, so its missing a few narrower functions like Bookmarking and Polls, but the core features it _does_ include are rock solid. The only wild card: what the fuck is Awoo Mode???

![iMast for iOS](https://i.snap.as/7A9pJMzD.png)

### [iMast](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imast/id1229461703)

For better or worse, [@rinsuki](https://mstdn.rinsuki.net/@rinsuki)’s iMast will require either a basic grasp of the Japanese language, or the patience to translate its menus and work backwards. (OCR came to mind, but I’m not quite dedicated enough to try it for this guide.) Assuming [Google’s translation](https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/review?uri=urn:aaid:scds:US:64ce057e-5adc-4578-a0ef-e9ddb6b5d545) of [its GitHub Pages site](https://cinderella-project.github.io/iMast/) is correct, iMast is also Open Source “under the Apache License 2.” Unlike Amaroq, it appears to have been built in Swift from the ground up. Unfortunately, that's about all I can comment on, though I would very much love to hear from any iMast users/Japanese speakers and will update this Post accordingly.

A function I _can_ provide: documenting [iMast’s Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/extratone/imastodon/blob/main/documentation/iMastKeyboardShortcuts.md).

#### iMast’s Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action              | Key        |
|:-------------------:|:----------:|
| Open Compose Window | ⌘ + N      |
| Send Toot           | ⌘ + Return |
| Home Timeline       | ⌘ + 1      |
| Notifications       | ⌘ + 2      |
| Local Timeline      | ⌘ + 3      |
| Others (Menu)       | ⌘ + 9      |

iMast is also the singular Mastodon app with a Siri Shortcuts action!

![Mercury for iOS - Scoops Theme](https://i.snap.as/ScJoTz8e.png)


### [Mercury](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mercury-for-mastodon/id1486749200)

Daniel Nitsikopoulos' [Mercury](https://onmercury.app) represents yet another entirely original direction in Social clients. It's fresh and "opinionated" in its explicit lack of support for instances that "[promote abuse and harassment](https://onmercury.app/help)." From all appearances, this appears to be the singular source of negative reviews on [its iOS App Store page](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mercury-for-mastodon/id1486749200). It's also the other option to offer widgets integration (in a single form, currently,) and custom audio notifications, though I couldn't capture a sample. Its [Trello Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/6EseiLSQ/mercury-roadmap) and [Feedback Repo](https://github.com/dNitza/mercury-issues/issues) are public but mostly inactive. As you can see in the grid embedded above, I absolutely adore its Scoops theme and find my $0.99 Tip 100% worth its custom icons.

<img src="https://i.snap.as/r8Qc4BPc.jpeg" alt="Mercury for iOS - Negative App Store Reviews" style="zoom: 25%;" />

Unfortunately, the state of Mercury's App Store reviews prompt yet another essential economic/editorial consideration. The one in the very center of the image embedded, above - from "FeralDandelion" - is the singular one I will allow myself to address. It is true that Mercury straight up refuses to authenticate or federate with a substantial amount of specific Mastodon servers, but it is **exhaustively explicit about this from very get-go**. Its [single-page Help document](https://onmercury.app/help) includes a detailed, up-to-date table of every single blocked instance and *the specific justification* for each respective instance's presence on it:

> Mercury takes a zero tolerance stance on abuse and harassment and as such does not support many instances that promote abuse and harassment.

Let me be clear: the practical manifestation of this position is **exclusively positive**. The Mastodon project has long outgrown the sort of fixation on ideology for ideology's sake that even Lucky Linus himself has no patience for. Instead, *thank Gourd* Mercury's developers took the time to better your social experience! In response to statements like the pullquote above, I expect ***only* thumbs in the air** from this point, forward.



![Metatext for iOS](https://i.snap.as/w7PTFpTf.png)

### [Metatext](https://apps.apple.com/app/metatext/id1523996615)

Metatext is perhaps the buzziest of all these apps - well-praised in every space I could find conversation on the subject. It's developed under [Justin Mazzocchi](https://mastodon.social/@jzzocc)'s software studio, [Metabolist](https://metabolist.org/) and is as [Open Source](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext) as it gets! (As per my hardware keyboard shortcuts crusade, I added [my own issue](https://github.com/metabolist/metatext/issues/40) requesting support.) [u/GummyKibble](https://www.reddit.com/user/GummyKibble/) noted that "it looks like a native app on both iOS and iPadOS." This term - *native* - seems inextricably linked with Metatext. I vaguely understand what it means, and I do agree, but it's worth noting that I speak with some privilege, having compared all of these apps on the top performing handset Apple currently has to offer. In many ways, it is the most frugal of the new offerings, especially, yet it strikes a keen balance between function and delight. I think "native" can be translated as *generally of a stout, sturdy disposition*, thanks to the care put into honing said balance. 

## Less-Than-Sanctioned

![Tootle for iOS](https://i.snap.as/S6VkSlY0.png)

### [Tootle](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootle-for-mastodon/id1236013466)

I'm not entirely positive which Mastodon app was *actually* the first on my iPhone, back in 2017, but I know for sure it was either Amaroq or the dearest, infinitely-colorful Tootle. Its [App Store Page](https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp) Version History suggests it has not been updated in 14 months, yet the app - which was apparently "Designed for iPad" - appears to be working just fine. There are some overlapping UI elements, but they're barely noticeable. Were it not for the new dev-facing store search tool mentioned above, I would have assumed this app long gone, to be honest, but using it again has somehow managed to genuinely twinge my nostalgia nerve.

In my search for any extra-App Store representation other than [Tootle's Mastodon Account](https://mastodon.cloud/@tootleapp) (which last posted the day after my birthday, last year,) I discovered [Tootle... for Linux](https://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2020/11/tootle-l-gtk3-mastodon-client-linux/). Since I am a dedicated and thorough person, these days, I spent several hours messing around with Linux Virtual Machining until Lubuntu finally functioned *just* so I could show you what it looks like. Below is a screen capture of Tootle bordered by the most Macish LXQ desktop bars included in Lubuntu and *even* wearing the new official Apple System Font, SF Pro. Still, I think you'll agree... Tootle for Linux is not related to Tootle.

![Tootle for Linux](https://i.snap.as/Rx3Eu9GA.png)

Personally, I find this a profound shame - I think more apps should be as colorful - and as color *configurable* - as this little, mysterious Mastodon app. I created the theme you see represented in the frames embedded above using *The Psalms* colors, naturally, and the whole process took less than five minutes. Play around with it as I remember doing, all those years ago, and you'd be surprised how hard it is to create an unusable color theme. What I find *most* shame in, though, is that Tootle appears to be completely invisible in regular app store searches, now. (And by "*most* shame," you know I really mean *entirely fucking unacceptable*.)

![Tusker on iOS](https://i.snap.as/82RtZcyl.png)	

### [Tusker](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wtB7HYvG)

I found my way to the only *currently in-development* entry on this list thanks to my Mastodon friend [wakest](https://social.wake.st/@liaizon). iOS developer [Shadowfacts](https://social.shadowfacts.net/users/shadowfacts) (who also maintains [*shadowfacts.net*](https://shadowfacts.net/)) is working on their considerate, distinct app, Tusker in [this self-hosted Repository](https://git.shadowfacts.net/shadowfacts/Tusker). In [#tusker](https://mastodon.social/web/timelines/tag/tusker) on Mastodon, you'll find a few poignant praises from [Pixelfed](https://pixelfed.org/) founder and principal developer [Dan Sup](https://mastodon.social/@dansup), which - from my perspective - are especially high, indeed. 

![Tusker Landscape Mode!](https://i.snap.as/jZudSEdQ.png)

Tusker's color customization options are technically... well.. *not infinite*, like other apps here, but the end result of their (obviously, very considered) selection will be a net win for 100% of users over that alternative, I believe. It is definitely of a similar philosophy to Metatext, but unquestionably more ambitious. Out of the lot, testing Tusker was the singular instance in which I found myself considering a "replacement" for Toot! You, yourself can use Tusker *right this very minute* via Apple's beta distribution system, [Testflight](https://testflight.apple.com/), via [**this invite link**](https://testflight.apple.com/join/wtB7HYvG).

![Roma for iOS](https://i.snap.as/oBYO4T1e.png)

### [Roma](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/roma-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1445328699)

Installing Roma for the first time led to a puzzling quest with a particularly pleasant end. I noticed fairly quickly that the iOS app was a re-branded release of what used to be Mast. My first instinct upon this discovery was to DM Mast's original developer, [Shihab Meboob](https://twitter.com/JPEGuin), on Twitter, but frankly, I've already bothered him enough there over the years, so it's understandable that I didn't hear back. When I downloaded the desktop app I found on [Roma's web page](https://www.roma.rocks/#desktop) and noticed its similarity to [Whalebird](https://whalebird.social/en/desktop/contents), I decided to use the site's contact form to [inquire](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/correspondence/Roma%20Inquiry.md) about what exactly was going on as gingerly as I could. Happily, I received a reply just *minutes* later from Leo Radvinsky, head of [Leo.com](https://leo.com/), "a Florida-based boutique venture capital fund that invests in technology companies:"

> Hi David, 
>
> In both cases we funded the original developers of both Mast and Whalebird to create a branded whitelabel app specially made for Pleroma. The idea was to make Roma a cross platform brand/app. It didn't really work out so now we're working on a new app from scratch called Fedi for iOS and Android and releasing that as open source. 
>
> https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fediverse.app&hl=en_US&gl=US 
>
> https://apps.apple.com/in/app/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1478806281 
>
> I think Roma has been removed from the app stores as it's no longer supported. 
>
> Let me know if you have any other questions

Though my hopes for the original Mast to live on in Roma form were more or less dashed by this message, the suggestion that someone is investing **actual capital** into federated social is certainly worth celebrating. If Roma is still available on the App Store as you're reading this, I insist you download it immediately. It represents an incredible and original attention to detail which should not simply be forgotten.

![Fedi for iOS](https://i.snap.as/4TO8CL5D.png)

### [Fedi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fedi-for-pleroma-and-mastodon/id1478806281)

Naturally, the app inheriting the work/resources established by Mast and Roma - known by *Fedi* - should be next up for discussion. Hopefully, my relative lack of experience with [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/) - another ActivityPub-based, federated social network - won't let you down, here. After a brief shock from the uniqueness of Fedi's UI passes, one immediately notices how beautifully it is animated, wholly disregarding my [recently-acquired](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1357394407201398791) preference for as little animation as possible. Perhaps more than any other app discussed here, Fedi feels uncannily bespoke in a way which iOS apps almost never do. It is undoubtedly the result of a very specific vision - to disregard the whole modern template for social apps and completely reimagine the archetype. Personally, I'm not sure if it would be easy to get used to, but my tastes/habits in this regard are very much the result of the past decade of proprietary social apps' blandness. Going forward with substantial financial backing and the talents of whoever it was that got it this far, no doubt we should all have very high hopes for Fedi.

![DUDU (嘟嘟) for iOS](https://i.snap.as/Kt8ZbQFk.png)

### [DUDU (嘟嘟)](https://bit.ly/duduios) 

DUDU (or "嘟嘟," which translates to "Toot," appropriately,) definitely wins for *Cutest Iconography*. It's a non-English-native application with exceptional English support, which I personally appreciate very much. Compared the entries immediately above, DUDU represents a much more modest interpretation of what a Mastodon client can offer. It’s robust, free of over-animation, and - most distinctly - very *wide*, which might have something to do with the "designed for iPad" subtitle on its App Store Page.

![Tootoise for iOS](https://i.snap.as/AZ7fRWc7.png)

### [Tootoise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootoise/id1465090190)

Yet another "Designed for iPad" entry, Naoki Kuwata's [Tootoise](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tootoise/id1465090190) is defined by its custom incoming post rate accommodations and its gorgeous Solarized theme. Its "Max number of new arrival posts" setting ranges from 0-400, allowing one to freeze their timeline entirely from any accidental (or habitual) Pulls to Refresh (set at 0,) load 400 Toots from such a gesture, or anything in between (at 40-Toot increments, anyway.) The advantages of this specification become immediately apparent when one actually begins to explore it, especially for those who have come to Mastodon after feeling overwhelmed by Big Social.

![Stella for iOS](https://i.snap.as/LzzNxqj9.png)

### [Stella](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stella/id921372048)

Yet another entirely one-of-a-kind experience, the slightly-mysterious Stella is listed as a "Mastodon, Twitter & News Client," and is notably one of the two apps on this list which do indeed support Twitter! More than that, it is the first app I've seen in a very long time that allows one to *simultaneously* post to two separate social services (Twitter and Mastodon, in this case.) Without documentation, it's a bit clunky, but its customizable timelines feature also allows one to combine multiple "sources" (social accounts) into a single timeline.

![B4X for Pleroma & Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/aSYoZ8t2.png)

### [B4X](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/b4x-for-pleroma-mastodon/id1538396871) 

B4X is yet another quite perplexing entry. The "Developer Website" link on its App Store Page leads to [b4x.com](https://www.b4x.com/contact_us.html) - a web page entitled "Anywhere Software." The GitHub icon in its footer led me to discover [a repository](https://github.com/AnywhereSoftware/B4X-Pleroma) which is labeled as such to lead one to believe it is, indeed, the development space for the iOS app we're discussing, but does not contain a single .swift or .pbxproj file - universally essential for iOS apps, as I understand it. Regardless, B4X appears to be built atop Anywhere Software's "rapid application development tools." I like its elemental simplicity and nice 'n' wide post display.

![Oyakodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/sFfxE4R7.png)

### [Oyakodon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oyakodon-for-mastodon/id1229174544)

Isao Takeyasu's [Oyakodon](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/oyakodon-for-mastodon/id1229174544) feels a bit like it originally began as a school project, and I mean that in the best possible sense. While it’s probably the least polished of the lot - and therefore likely the least viable candidate for the role of your primary, daily-driven Mastodon client - is is far from a throwaway application. Some evil component of Takeyasu’s mind was clearly let loose if only for a moment, for Oyakodon’s Facebook-style theme is reminiscent enough of Big Blue to alarm. The volume of its design definitely peaks in its Cute theme, which is so violently loud I could not help but extract its color palette to illustrate just how furious its creator must have been.

![Oyakodon Cute Theme Palette](https://i.snap.as/AFbihGYF.jpeg)

Truly diabolical design, there. For better or worse, Oyakodon doesn’t really work very well in its current state, but it _does_ work. 

![StarPterano for iOS](https://i.snap.as/D34uONFT.png)

### [StarPterano](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/starpterano/id1436972796)
I very vaguely remember happening upon StarPterano in my very first moments on Mastodon, so finding it still published on the App Store - buried as it was - brought me a particular sort of joy. If I’m not mistaken, it holds a special personal accolade as the only iOS app which has caused me to involuntarily shriek. This might sound like an insult, but it is actually the peak of my praise. I believe my knowledge of iOS development safely allows me to suppose that StarPterano was built with complete disregard for any established UI element libraries. That is, the familiar toggles and buttons developers rely on to standardize the iOS experience were cast aside entirely in favor of handbuilt, translucent buttons of a sort of neon quality which call menus and text entry fields no less alien to the platform. The most astonishing bit, though, is that it _works_. On my 12 Pro Max, it’s exceptionally smooth, in fact.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/StarPterano/raw/master/DonParade/Sound/decision21.mp3">
</audio>

I would imagine those _real_ iOS developers among you should find [StarPterano’s GitHub Repository](https://github.com/pgostation/StarPterano-iOS5) particularly interesting, considering. In the interest of preservation, I have [forked it](https://github.com/softwarehistorysociety/StarPterano) as well, and fully intend to dive in to its code, one of these days. The audio player embedded above cites a three-second .mp3 file in the repository which perhaps once accounted for the “Sounds” toggle still found in the Settings menu of StarPterano’s current build. I couldn’t get the app to reproduce it, which is actually what set me on the hunt that led to the repo. 

![Ore2 for iOS](https://i.snap.as/Ln2L96Qa.png)

### [Ore2](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ore2-for-twitter-mastodon/id1107176601)

Ore2 is another (apparently) non-English-native Mastodon client focused on consolidating Mastodon and Twitter within a single space. Alongside Stella, it's the second of the first two apps I've come across in a very long time which allows one to post to both services simultaneously. Considerable work was obviously done on making its timeline-based tabs switchable with touch. Personally, I very much prefer my current crossposting configuration via [this (generously-public) web tool](https://crossposter.masto.donte.com.br), but I am all but certain those users exist who will find Ore2’s setup preferable. 


![tooot for iOS](https://i.snap.as/b0GaeasV.png)

### [tooot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tooot/id1549772269)

Inadvertently, I have saved the best story of the lot for last. Developer and researcher Zhiyuan Zheng documents both the narrative context leading up to the creation of his first app, [tooot](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tooot/id1549772269), as well as the philosophy behind its design in “[Building my first app - toot](https://xmflsct.com/2021/tooot/).” His reference to the downfall of a prominent social app in mainland China called Douban - and the “Douban Refugees”  which resulted - are alarmingly missing from all English news organizations save for [a single _Quartz_ article](https://qz.com/1726194/the-decline-of-douban-an-online-sanctuary-for-chinas-liberals/) from October 2019. He eludes to a “boom” of Mastodon adoption in the past few years and cites a lack of “user friendly mobile clients” which I can only assume to be a conundrum specific to China.

“With the aim of contributing to the community and to this movement, I decided to take my quarantine time to build an enjoyable mobile client for Douban Refugees,” he explains. He notes that decentralized platforms have universally rejected algorithmic recommendation if for any other reason than “without centralized computing power, such [a] recommendation service is also not that feasible.” “Adapting” back to a linear timeline in a manner which still encourages exploration was clearly a major design consideration for tooot.

> The core consists of 3 needs: 1) what I can read; 2) what I can write; 3) what I have done.

Obviously, I very much appreciate Zhiyuan writing publicly about his thoughts on decentralized social and sharing specific considerations in his app’s design and look forward to continued updates.

## Get Bent, Big Social

A few universal truths among these apps stand out as obligatory mentions. First - in comparison with their Proprietary, Big Social counterparts - they are all _ridiculously_ **frugal**. Not a one weighs over 40mb, while minor (unexplained) updates to the official Twitter app [often exceed 100mb](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494). They are all astonishingly **robust** - I did not experience a single crash in the course of normal testing these "alt" social apps- even from the beta builds - while I distinctly remember the official Twitter app crashing several times over this period, even after I deleted and reinstalled it (an accepted maintenance requirement for anyone using it heavily for its entire history.) Also, on the topic of the platform, itself, they are also made absurdly **interoperable** by the ActivityPub standard. My [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.social/DavidBlue) posts show up seamlessly on their timelines among content from [Diaspora](https://diasp.org/), [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social/), and Mastodon, itself. 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1393294957352468494

The overwhelming impression I was left with after testing these apps was one of unwavering competence, cleverness, and true innovation. How many different ways can I possibly conjure forth in order to communicate this? I, David Blue - the vain fucker with a precollection for the most superficial variables of software design *so* healthy that I have on multiple occasions designed whole, years-long workflows around specific applications *entirely because of their available color palettes*... **It is I who requires you to take a good fucking look**, because this list of decentralized, largely open source, federated social software is a goddamned fashion show.

## Continuing to Explore Social Ownership
![Mastodon Account Wordcloud](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/122717470-43f08a00-d231-11eb-890f-dfa3ff33b65d.png)

This couldn't be "just" an app guide - I think I have thoroughly accepted this, by now, just in time for some conclusionary remarks. Somehow, the subject I originally tackled specifically because I thought it would be quick, rudimentary, and straightforward has become yet another personal journey. It'd feel a bit preposterous to declare any one of these apps to be *life-changing*, but - in every sense of the term, in contemporary, inevitably social media-informed life, they do indeed constitute a form of radical, ideological wellness. Each of them managed to remind me of a different minute delight found within a developer-user dynamic made up of thoughtful and effective minds working to contribute original and valuable experiences, first. Most noteworthy of these little freedoms: the realization that the upcoming "official" Mastodon app along with any future new options are exclusively a positive thing *for the user*... None of these apps were conceived to gobble up market share because the market is fundamentally, inevitably, uncompromisingly *infinitely shared*. I don't know anything about business, but I *do* know that relief from the burden of considering proprietary multivectored development intentions has been personally breathtaking. I can only hope the reciprocal compensation is happening at even a fraction of what it "should" be. 

From another essential direction, I hope I have communicated that they're far from curious, "niche" or vanity side projects, now. When I used the term "mature" in introducing this little arena, I very much meant it - these "alt" social clients developed almost exclusively within single-person-led projects now make the Twitter for iOS app look ugly *and* fucking broken. "Giving social networking back to you" has never been more resonant. Yes, it really is Toot!'s "take a break" blue screen, Amaroq's mysterious Awoo mode toggle, iMast's music app integration, Mercury's configurable timelines, Metatext's native solidity, Tootle's custom colors, Tusker's Digital Wellness controls, DUDU's elemental readability, Roma's quiet resurrection of Mast's UI bravado, Stella's utterly bizarre visual departures, Fedi's odd animated UI behaviors, Tootoise's consideration of *pace*, B4X's unfathomable elements, Ore2's parallel timelines, tooot's development story, and Oyakodon's adorable rough edges that have made my online life *measurably*... *immensely* better, these past weeks. At the forefront of this perception is undoubtedly the comparatively extensive *control* over my social experience as a user offered by the diversity of mobile experiences these applications offer.

Those of you who haven't yet signed up for Mastodon: ==you are missing the fuck out==. I am being *actually* pampered, now, in World Wide Web terms. You are [*so* welcome](https://bit.ly/dbmastodon) whenever you're ready - the water is nice and warm, as they say.

## ...Party One

![Mastodon for iOS](https://i.snap.as/sHTDx8AV.png)

Yes, you are looking at the currently in-development **"*Official*" Mastodon app on iOS**, coming very soon to the Awful App Store. You can join me in testing the app right this very moment by contributing to [the Mastodon Project's Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/mastodon). Though I do plan to publish [a dedicated review](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/195) on its release date, what I'll say for now is that it's very cute, includes *the* most gorgeous media player I've ever seen on an iOS app, and is as distinctly clever as any of the third-party family we've just visited, all whilst maintaining an expert's aim at its evangelist purpose.

The surprise that threw me over the edge to a genuinely pitiful extent: the official Mastodon app already includes full **Bluetooth keyboard shortcuts integration on iPhone!**

# Duplicating My (Overwhelmingly Positive) Mastodon Experience

## Elsewhere
* [Reddit Thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Mastodon/comments/oodgqe/i_could_literally_offer_an_exact_duplicate_of_my/)

When I’ve gotten other folks to talk at all about their Mastodon experiences, almost all of them have at least one pet happening, personality, or general cultural gripe to cite. I think it’s quickly becoming the prime obstacle in my one-on-one conversations about Mastodon, at least. My personal experience, notably, has been completely exempt of all these experiences I’ve heard so far - I have literally only been compelled to unfollow less than 5 accounts in the round 5 years I’ve been a daily user. Also important: My “social media methodology” is very indiscriminate. I follow anyone who says anything remotely interesting or entertaining as soon as I see it, pretty much, and then *never leave them alone*.

Anyway, it recently occurred to me that I could literally offer *an exact duplicate* of my personal Mastodon experience very easily thanks to Tootsuite’s import/export function. The CSV files of my most recent [**Following** list](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonfollowing.csv) and [**Lists**… list](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/curation/mastodonlists.csv)… are both now linkable in a public GitHub Repo. 

Hypothetically, I could instruct a potential new user to make a test account and import these files, but - as I understand it - this process would be a pretty significant happening, both for backend server considerations and for actual users involved. I think I can surmise all on my own that it’s probably not something I would offer more than 5-10 people, ever, though as of this moment, my realistic chances of finding a single one actually willing to do it seem all but non existent. 

Obviously, I thought it very important to consult the community, first, for two primary considerations:

1. Is this gonna fucking break everything, admins?
2. Users… potentially those I follow right now who would be followed by a brand new account - along with nearly 700 others across the fediverse - all at once… How do you feel about this? 

Also, howdy forum! <3 
# App Store Review Day
![Mastodon iOS Apps](https://i.snap.as/vAk0jm6X.png)

## A commitment to share my thoughts where developers actually want them, and an invitation for other reviewers/users to join me.

I have written more than my fair share of words about software, as I have loved, despised, and been utterly perplexed by it. This year, my return to the iOS community has perhaps inevitably turned _apps_ into an addiction of sorts. This particular platform is so utterly chock full/stocked up of creativity at a scale immeasurably greater and more accessible than the whole of those throughout computing history, combined. For someone like myself, it is all too easy to allow oneself to wander down a virtually endless path of intriguing, very self-indulgent play, especially now that third-party sites like [Departures.to](https://departures.to) have managed to add discoverability to TestFlight beta distributions, allowing those non-millionaires among us opportunities to use test releases of applications we would’ve otherwise had to pay for. This has been exclusively to my benefit - I can only imagine what 15 year-old me would have done with such power.

![Your Ratings and Reviews - Apple App Store](https://i.snap.as/jIYBC6xU.png)

In my recent endeavor to focus on making my work more useful to others, I've reflected on something I've heard from nigh every developer of the apps I've reviewed: *Ah yes, your blog looks really cool but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE REVIEW MY FUCKING APP on the FUCKING STORE.* Read: your commentary is appreciated, but your five stars would almost certainly more economically beneficial.

As you can see from the image embedded above, I have personally fallen *very* behind in doing my part for those apps I've celebrated, here. A vague intention to *get around to it eventually* clearly is not working, so I've decided to give myself a deadline: **August 15th, 2021** - precisely one month from today. By this date, I will have sifted through my commentary on apps in this setting and adapted the most useful of it (per app, obviously) into a manner appropriate to appear on an App Store Page, and **I would like to formally-ish invite other tech writers/app reviewers to join me**.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318

I'm terrible at community organization, which certainly does not exclude events, so I very much welcome any feedback you might have, as well as any collaborative contributions you'd be interested in making. As I see it, I have a few essential considerations to offer. 

First, the page in the screen capture above - which can be found in the App Store App ⇨ Account (your profile picture in the top-right corner) ⇨ Account Settings (the tapable element at the very top with your profile picture and information) ⇨ Ratings and Reviews - is *broken as hell*, along with the rest of the Account Settings menu, notably. This is important because I insist we all complain about it on all available channels, considering it's been broken for several months, at least.

Second, you should almost certainly use [**this "new" dev-facing tool**](https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/) when searching the App Store, considering that it *actually works* in a trustable way, unlike the user-facing tool in the app.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1415732070626758663

Since the standard online palette of event organization software are all so easy to use, these days, I've established event pages for this event on multiple platforms, linked in the list below, which I will update as per any suggestions/requests for equivalent pages on other services. Of course, it's certainly not a requirement that you join/engage with any of them.

One could could certainly just add the date to their own calendar (conveniently with [this .ics file](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WM2esll-Yf5Fg4gO9ZYVAJ0pPrdexGqF/view?usp=sharing),) remain entirely silent about the thing on social, and still be participating. Those interested in further engagement, however, can Chat Me Up on [*Extratone*'s Discord](https://bit.ly/extratone), the [Teams event chat](https://teams.live.com/meet/93913819139325), [Telegram](https://t.me/extratoe), [etc](https://davidblue.wtf). I also plan to reshare most of this post as [a thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1415732070626758663).

- [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions/194)
- [.ics File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WM2esll-Yf5Fg4gO9ZYVAJ0pPrdexGqF/view?usp=sharing)

As we face the horrendous, utterly inexcusable state of Discovery on the App Store/Apple's general fuckery regarding the independent developers mostly responsible for making its platforms a worthwhile space, I hope I've created something of value in whipping up this "event." If you have thoughts on how I might do so more effectively, once again, *please do* reach out.

# [My iPad Setup](https://nipunbatra.github.io/blog/setup/2021/06/14/setup-ipad.html)

# Caveats and Story
My laptop is broken. I am away from office. I have an iPad Pro 2020. I got my office desktop's magic keyboard and trackpad. In this post I am discussing if iPad can help given that I do not have (physical) access to my main computers. Would I recommend this over a main computer - No! But, can you do some things on the iPad reasonably well enough given keyboard and trackpad - Yes! 


# The Hardware

The magic keyboard and the magic trackpad greatly increase the iPad experience and make it programmer friendly.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/IPAD-Photo.jpeg "Magic Keyboard and Trackpad")


# Setting up an iPad for programming

## Setting up the terminal app (a-Shell)


### Configuration

First, after installing a-Shell, I like to set the font size, terminal background and foreground color. Here is how the a-shell app looks like


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/A-shell-initial.png "a-shell on the iPad is my favourite app!")

`config -b black -f white -s 20`

### Text editing and bookmarks
Sometimes I like using vim for editing documents and interfacing with WorkingCopy. a-Shell provides vim!

I like to setup a `bookmark` to the WorkingCopy folder so that I can direcly edit files in that location.

I do so by:
writing `pickFolder` in a-Shell and setting it to WorkingCopy folder. Now I can set a bookmark to this location. I do so by: 
`bookmark git` in the current location (set by pickFolder)

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Bookmark-Git.png "Setting Bookmark location to WorkingApp -> git")

### Git
Interestingly, the latest testflight version of a-shell also provides a "Git-like" interface called `libgit2`. Configuring it requires specific steps that I'm writing below. Some of these steps are borrowed from this [nice tutorial](https://devmarketer.io/learn/set-ssh-key-github/) and some are specific to a-shell that I was able to get working courtesy a Twitter discussion with the creator of a-shell. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Twitter.png "Twitter discussion with the creator of a-shell")

Now, the steps.

First, we need to create a new ssh key.

We do so by 
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@domain.com"

```

While configuring I did not setup the passphrase.

The private and public keys are stored in `.ssh` with the name id_rsa 

```bash
$ ls -lah .ssh|grep "id"
-rw-------   1 mobile  mobile   3.3K Jun 14 15:43 id_rsa
-rw-------   1 mobile  mobile   747B Jun 14 15:43 id_rsa.pub
```

Next, I copied the public key in a newly generated ssh key in Github and gave it a name.

Next, I modified `.gitconfig` as follows

```bash
$ cat .gitconfig 
[user]
        email = MY EMAIL ID
        name = MY NAME
        identityFile =  id_rsa 
```

Now, I was almost done!

I was able to push and pull from some old Github repositories but the same did not work with the newer repositories. Again, after a discussion with the creator of a-shell, I figured, this was due to the fact that Github changed the name of the default branch as "main" instead of the earlier "master" whereas libgit2 implementation was expecting "master".

As a quickfix I renamed the branch on my Github repo as "master" and for now set the default branch to be named "master".

Finally, I am able to pull and push to the repositories. The next image infact is showing commits and pushes made to the repository generating the blog post you are reading. 


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/libgit-2.png "libgit2 push and commiting")

### SSH/SFTP

There are a couple of amazing apps: Termius and SecureShell. Both have very neat interfaces. I found the intergrations with the Files app very good!

The GIF below shows the SecureShell app in action where I transfer a file from my local storage (iPad) to remote server, process that file, and quickly copy the processed file back to local storage. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SecureShell.gif "Working with SecureShell is amazing!")

Another great functionality of the SecureShell is the "Offline" folder. 

Another setting that I use is the Powerline fonts on my remote systems. Using Fontcase, I installed the corresponding powerline fonts on the iPad so that my SecureShell session looks great.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powerline-combined.png "Powerline fonts installed via Fontcase allow special characters on the remote terminalls (above image without powerline font on iPad, below one with powerline font")



### Some other amazing tools

I like the "view" utility in a-shell a lot. It can quickly help you preview various filetypes.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/view.gif "The view utility in a-shell")

Also, as a quick tip, one can use Command + W to quickly exit the preview and use the back and forward keys to cycle through the files. This is very useful!

I also like the fact that the `convert` tool now comes in inbuilt. It can convert between a variety of formats easily. 

`pbcopy` and `pbpaste` are very convenient utilities to copy to and from the clipboard. Here is how I copied the content of factorial.py into the clipboard.

```bash
pbcopy < factorial.py  
```

### Shortcuts

a-Shell interfaces nicely with Shortcuts. The following gif shows an interface where I take an input from Shortcuts app -> Pass it to a Python script and execute it inside a-shell -> Store the results in a text file -> View the content of the text file in Shortcuts.


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/shortcuts.gif "Using shortcuts in a-shell with Python!")

The link to this shortcut is [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a04946a553df4e9790b2c352c5663b0a)

The following is the simple Python script I used called factorial.py

```python
import math
import sys

num = int(sys.argv[1])
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {math.factorial(num)}")
```

The following is an image of the shortcut. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Shortcut-Working.png "Using shortcuts in a-shell with Python!")

Based on the suggestion [here](https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell/issues/74#issuecomment-861416673), I used pbcopy to copy the content to the clipboard and use it directly. It reduces the number of lines! 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Shortcut-2.png "More efficient version using clipboard")

## Using the WorkingCopy App

WorkingCopy is a very nicely made Git app on the iPad. It is one of the best made apps I have used!

I'll let the pictures do the talking.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Working-Copy-1.png "WorkingCopy App interface")

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Working-Copy-2.png "WorkingCopy App interfaces nicely with the Files app!")

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Working-Copy-3.png "WorkingCopy App can nicely show the diffs")




## Editors

I use one of the following for editing:

* Koder App
* WorkingCopy App
* vim (in a-Shell)
* Textastic
* Typewriter for Markdown — is an editor only for markdown but gives a nice quick preview. The image below shows the screenshot from Typewriter for Markdown app. 

# Setting Linux/Mac machine and iPad for Python programming (via Jupyter notebooks)

On the Linux/Mac (remote server) machines I set up Jupyter notebooks as follows:

First, I create the configuration file via: `jupyter notebook --generate-config`

Next, In `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` change

```python

c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*'
c.NotebookApp.port = SET YOUR PORT
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
```

Set password using:
```
jupyter notebook password 
```

Run notebook as:
```bash
nohup jupyter notebook& 
```

On the client end (iPad in this case), I use one of the following two ways to access remote Jupyter instances:

* Using the Juno Connect app
Juno connectly nicely saves all the configuration and can do the necessary port forwarding

* Using Safari and opening the remote Jupyter URL
Just open the remote URL with the set port number. I use my workplace recommended VPN client to get into my workplace network and access non-public IP based servers.

# VNC connection

I tried a few VNC software and found AnyDesk to work fairly well. I did a bunch of small settings tweak.
* I setup a password on my remote machine for uninterruped access 
* I put AnyDesk in the login items on my remote machine so that it starts when the system boots

# Email client

I like the Spark app. 

- The interface is pretty clean. 
- It has a bunch of keyboard shortcuts making it nice to use with an external keyboard. 
- It is trivial to interface with various cloud providers.
- It is trivial to save an email as a PDF.
- It is trivial to create a "link" to an email for sharing. 

# PDF management

The iPad Files app is a fairly well made app. Perhaps not as functional as the Mac Preview app, but, does some things well.

For instance, merging multiple PDFs is easier (for me) than doing the same on Mac. One just needs to select multiple files and then "right" click to "Create PDF"

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CombinePDF.gif "Combining PDFs is trivial on the iPad using Files app")

I use the following ffmpeg command (inside a-Shell) to create this GIF courtesy this excellent tutorial from [GIPHY folks](https://engineering.giphy.com/how-to-make-gifs-with-ffmpeg/)

# PDF viewing

The Documents app has a very nice pdf viewing experience. It gives the "full-screen" experience on connected displays and can potentially be an excellent pdf viewer for showing my slides on the projector in the classroom setting.


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PDF-view.png "Documents app is an excellent PDF viewer!")

Another advantage of the Documents app PDF viewer is that we can change the tone to Sepia or Dark. The following image shows the view I get when I change the tone to Dark.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PDF-view-dark.png "The dark tone with the click of a button is an amazing feature!")

When connected to an external display, the PDF viewer gives various options. In the next image, I show the view when I "focus" on a part of the slide.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PDF-view-focus.png "Focusing on parts of pdf")

Finally, the image below shows the "focused" slide on the external display.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PDF-screen-focus.jpeg "Focusing on parts of pdf on external display")

```bash
ffmpeg -i Video.MP4  -filter_complex "[0:v]  fps=12,scale=720:-1,split [a][b];[a] palettegen [p];[b][p] palette
use" CombinePDF.gif
```

Another alternative is to use the [following shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f9a9c2cc6e61476abf2e35f654869553&xcust=1-1-232739-0-0-0&
) to convert the screen recorded video into a GIF 


# Some Safari keyboard shortcuts
- Command + W for closing a tab
- Command + L for going to the address bar (sometimes on tabs I am not automatically on the address bar)


# Conclusions (and rants)

For the long run, ofcourse, I would not recommend this kind of a setup. There is some learning and fun in getting a "resticted" device to function well, but as a main machine, probably no, at least not for the next few months. A comparably priced laptop (say M1 Macbook Air) would offer a lot more.

There are many things I'm missing:

- Projection to a projector and screen recording do not work at the same time. 
- No proper dev environment like VSCode
- A lot of screen size is "wasted" due to the OS
- A lot of the apps are not as good as I'd like. For instance, perhaps a minor thing, but the Youtube app doesn't have a keyboard shortcut for full screen. One can ofcourse do the same on Safari. iMovie in Mac has a remove background noise feature that works very well. The iPad version does not have the same.
- Safari though much improved over the years is not as functional as Safari on the Mac
- While quicklook/Files is good, the functionality of something like Preview is hard to beat
- The files app can not show hidden files and folders
- Powerpoint does not have features like audio recording (though can play)
- Keynote, Pages, Numbers require additional clicks than their Mac counterparts
- When I connect to an external display, I get thick black bars and moreover, if the monitor does not give me an HDMI out, I can not hear audio as the audio is also routed. As good as the iPad's display is, it is not huge and strains my eyes after a while. 
- Copy pasting using the keyboard is a hit and miss. For instance, it fails several times for me when copying from a pdf. Right clicking and copy seems to always work, but, it is more steps than Command C, Command V.
- I miss some quality apps like OBS Studio, especially being an academic teaching remotely due to the pandemic.
- While a-shell is amazing, it is limited by what webassembly can do. At the time of writing, it does not support multithreading and thus the performance of utilities like `ffmpeg` is severely limited. Also, a-shell programs can not be stopped intermediate in their execution. See the following two bugs on Github related to this: 
    - https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell/issues/270
    - https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell/issues/269


Some of the above may be resolved over the next updates and the major iPadOS15 updates. Though, I do not expect most of them to be resolved anytime soon.

Capture books and documents with the original images intact and the text embedded. Save your scan as a single- or multi-page PDF with all its text fully searchable and selectable.
Just the text? Frame a page, a document, a sign, or a receipt. Tap to extract the text. Tap again to copy it to the clipboard.
Export is easy. Share via Airdrop or text. Save to your photo library or a folder of your choice. Or copy your scan to other apps.
No nonsense. Just the app. You don't need an account to use Scan Thing. You don't need internet access. Your scans never leave your device and all processing happens on your device. Because your privacy is important (not to mention none of our business), we collect no data whatsoever and we don't use any third-party code. Your privacy is yours, and we think it should stay that way.

# Per-Browser Keyboard Shortcut Behaviors ~~Inconsistencies~~

On the surface, it feels like Web Browsers have never been better - and certainly that we’ve never had so many choices among them

Expectedly, Apple’s own Safari has remained definitively the most accommodating of hardware keyboard shortcuts use among the comparatively. At this point, I have become so dependent on `⌘ + L` and `Alt + L` that it’s basically the only deciding factor

@viticci I’m really enjoying the new Safari on iOS and the better reachability.
The animation to see all open tabs is so slick (UI bugs notwithstanding).
Have you seen you can long-press the elements in the bottom bar? Totally unintuitive & hidden but glad they’re there! https://twitter.com/mralexhay/status/1411223817276506112/video/11

## Continuing to Explore Social Ownership
![Mastodon Account Wordcloud](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/122717470-43f08a00-d231-11eb-890f-dfa3ff33b65d.png)
This couldn't be "just" an app guide - I think I have thoroughly accepted this, by now, just in time for some conclusionary remarks. Somehow, the subject I originally tackled specifically because I thought it would be quick, rudimentary, and straightforward has become yet another personal journey. It'd feel a bit preposterous to declare any one of these apps to be *life-changing*, but - in every sense of the term, in contemporary, inevitably social media-informed life, they do indeed constitute a form of radical, ideological wellness. Each of them managed to remind me of a different minute delight found within a developer-user dynamic made up of thoughtful and effective minds working to contribute original and valuable experiences, first. Most noteworthy of these little freedoms: the realization that the upcoming "official" Mastodon app along with any future new options are exclusively a positive thing *for the user*... None of these apps were conceived to gobble up market share because the market is fundamentally, inevitably, uncompromisingly *infinitely shared*. I don't know anything about business, but I *do* know that relief from the burden of considering proprietary multivectored development intentions has been personally breathtaking. I can only hope the reciprocal compensation is happening at even a fraction of what it "should" be. 

From another essential direction, I hope I have communicated that they're far from curious, "niche" or vanity side projects, now. When I used the term "mature" in introducing this little arena, I very much meant it - these "alt" social clients developed almost exclusively within single-person-led projects now make the Twitter for iOS app look ugly *and* fucking broken. "Giving social networking back to you" has never been more resonant. Yes, it really is Toot!'s "take a break" blue screen, Amaroq's mysterious Awoo mode toggle, iMast's music app integration, Mercury's configurable timelines, Metatext's native solidity, Tootle's custom colors, Tusker's Digital Wellness controls, Dudu's elemental readability, Roma's quiet resurrection of Mast's UI bravado, Stella's utterly bizarre visual departures, Fedi's odd animated UI behaviors, Tootoise's consideration of *pace*, B4X's unfathomable elements, and Oyakodon's adorable rough edges that have made my online life *measurably*... *immensely* better, these past weeks. At the forefront of this perception is undoubtedly the comparatively extensive *control* over my social experience as a user offered by the diversity of mobile experiences these applications offer.



Those of you who haven't yet signed up for Mastodon: you are missing out. I am being *actually* pampered, now, in World Wide Web terms. You are *so* welcome whenever you're ready - the water is nice and warm, as they say.

# Writeas/WriteFreely iOS Publishing Workflow

![Editorial Git - Wood](https://i.snap.as/ocT2o2B3.png)

## Demonstrating the particulars of a version-tracked Markdown publishing process - including the full extent of parallel research, documentation, and web development - optimized for and entirely contained within iPhone (for the insane.)

[[Notes: Writeas/WriteFreely iOS Publishing Workflow]]

When _Extratone_ was running on WordPress, I found myself writing about it all the time, partially because I was learning how broken the web had become (largely thanks to WordPress,) but mostly because of all the drama surrounding the endeavor. There’s a lot to say about bad software, so writing about it is _easy_ - I understand this truth, intimately - but _The Psalms_’ number one mandate is to celebrate uniquely clever, undercovered solutions, and by golly, one has been staring both you and I in the face for years, now, without mention on this blog. This year’s dive into iOS has inadvertently lead to many unexpected avenues of exploration, but the one that has underpinned them all has been using my iPhone 12 Pro Max as (essentially) my _primary machine_ for all of it: research, notes, (astonishingly) working in public via Git, composition, publishing, and spreading it all around. Write.as - the SaaS implementation of WriteFreely - is not only _capable_ of supporting this workflow - in my extensive use, I have discovered a path for which it is _particularly optimized_, I think. As I have committed to stop taking the Write.as suite for granted and become a more actively productive member of its community, I’d say it is the perfect time (for once) to let loose and zoom _all the way in_. 

## Apps
* [**WriteFreely**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/writefreely/id1531530896) - the official, [open source](https://github.com/writefreely/writefreely-swiftui-multiplatform) app is more than worth its one-time $9.99 price if you’ve committed to Write.as to any degree.
* [**Anybuffer**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anybuffer/id1330815414) or another clipboard manager of your choice. I actually use (and adore) Copied, but it has been removed from the App Store due to a “[patent infringement claim](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1386154771850043392).” 
* A **Markdown-based text editor** of your choice - [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447), [Taio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taio-markdown-text-actions/id1527036273) and [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471) are the “premium” options I’d start anyone with. Since it’s arguably the most powerful of these and my personal choice at the moment, I will be using Drafts in this post. For those with ultra-specific taste like me, Brett Terpstra maintains the most [obsessively-comprehensive database of iOS-based text editors](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/) ever to exist.
* [**Telegram**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807) - for those who don’t have a MacOS-running desktop, Telegram’s private “saved messages” feature is still _the_ most handy method of exchanging links and files between an iPhone and desktop with its insane 2GB cap _per file_ and [extraordinary adaptability to inconsistent network connectivity](https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights).
* A **second/alternative web browser** - It might sound silly to set aside a whole web browser on your phone just for interacting with Write.as and Snap.as, but I’ve found it invaluable and there are _literally_ one billion browsers to choose from on the App Store, but I’m going to use [Google Chrome](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823) ([Chrome Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/LPQmtkUs), technically,) mostly because it is the (very distantly) second-most consistently supportive of hardware keyboard shortcuts behind Safari.

### Excess mode
The above apps are all that’s needed if your end goal is just publishing and editing to Write.as or your own WriteFreely server, but if you want to go as _all in_ as I have - or, notably, if an iPhone/iPad is the only computer you have access to, for whatever reason - you’ll probably be astonished (as I was) at how well you can accomplish just about _everything_ involved in **development** on your goddamned cellular phone, these days: editing CSS themes, configuring Javascript additions, parsing JSON analytics data exports, extensive performance testing, _scraping_/archiving, fileserver management, and on and on…

There is a limit, but it feels completely absurd to define: you can’t actually _host_ a WriteFreely installation on your phone. That is to say - you can’t really use your cell phone as a fucking server… At the moment, anyway. Considering you _can_ run the Write.as command line client in a Linux shell and interact with the service via the Write.as API… on your phone… Who is to say, really, if running a persistent Linux server in the background will be possible on iPhone in the near future?[^1]

All that said, here are some apps enabling _mobile web development_:

* [**Working Copy**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) is the Git client of choice on iOS. It is alarmingly capable and thoughtfully designed to wholly integrate Git into the OS so that it is not only _usable_ but (incredibly) _natural_ to use it. Pushing and committing a file with full annotation can be accomplished _from the share sheet_.
* [**GitHub for iOS**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905) is still the best way to make use of the GitHub-specific, extra-Git features handled in this workflow (manipulating/commenting on Issues, mainly.)
* [**Kodex**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kodex/id1038574481) is my favorite code editor/IDE for directly editing files. It’s beautiful, free, and designed to make the best of the ridiculous undertaking that is code editing on iPhone.
* [**iSH Shell**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243) is a **full Linux shell on your fucking iPhone** with [an incredibly helpful community](https://discord.gg/iSH). Realistically, it’s best for running little Command Line utilities like [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc), but it is also disturbingly capable of crazy scraping shit with wget and youtube-dl. Theoretically, old school Gitists who prefer to use it in the Command Line could do so in iSH, but [a-Shell](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438) (the popular alternative) might be more optimized for that, considering it functions as an actual Terminal within Files. (Sorry, I’m not quite crazy enough to try it.)
* For CSS color alterations, I’m concluding my recommendations with two Hex-based utilities: [Color Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/color-pro-p3-picker/id1207928528) for precision color _picking_, and [Pastel](![Drafts and Git on iOS](https://i.snap.as/3jFBoVzA.png)) for keeping track of them with “palettes.”

![Drafts and Git on iOS](https://i.snap.as/3jFBoVzA.png)

Before I go on, I must once again make a big effort to accredit the very same Federico Viticci: I began this guide thinking his original [Markdown + Working Copy x GitHub iPad Pro publishing workflow](https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/) dated back to November 2018, but I clearly need to pay more mind to hyperlinks because it actually [_originated_ sometime in **_2016_**]((https://www.macstories.net/stories/one-year-of-ipad-pro/6/#content), which is… An entirely distinct kettle of fish. 

> Each MacStories writer has their own private GitHub repository where they can save drafts of articles currently being worked on. Other members are invited to the repository so they can read each other’s stories and provide feedback. We have a general Club MacStories repository that John and I use to assemble issues of our newsletter every week, and I also have a personal repository where I save drafts I would like others to read in advance.

It was _very_  recently that I observed in my notes for “[Editorial Git](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions/86)” that *The Psalms* might have been the longest-running implementation of Git in the “real world” writing process as opposed to the the mostly-demonstrative discourse from a microera around 2018-2019 when Markdown and Git were considered as the future of _academic_ publishing. As far as I can tell, the conversation was largely prompted (or substantially revived, at least) by WashU professor Ed Hagen in an essay/blog post entitled “[Should scientific publishing move to Github and friends?](https://grasshoppermouse.github.io/posts/2019-07-12-should-scientific-publishing-move-to-github-and-friends/),” which gathers a variety of references to projects exploring parallel avenues and comprehensively proposes a theoretical workflow. Since the more recent of the aforelinked Federico posts describes his use of the very same services (Working Copy and Github,) is freely available, impeccably well-considered, and beautiful to read, I’m going to proceed as if I have nothing original to contribute to that conversation (because I don’t.)

I’d ask that _you_ proceed with the knowledge that this guide is far from absolute - you can and _should_ pick and choose different components to form your own workflow - and that it is definitely not exclusive to Write.as/WriteFreely, considering our end output is markdown-formatted text. I have chosen to frame it around the .as suite because it (debatably) [saved my life](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) and I am therefore quite personally invested in the growth of its userbase and the health of its community. On that vein, I’ve recently [committed to starting the WriteFreely Community Discord Server](https://discuss.write.as/t/write-as-writefreely-community-discord/2831) and published [a new version of this blog’s theme](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/releases/tag/3.1) which I hope will prove useful to newcomers interested in customizing their Write.as/WriteFreely blogs.

I also want to make it clear that this guide was written as a exploration of what is technically possible on iOS/iPhone at the moment, _not_ what I’d consider actually _advisable_. While I myself have been playing around across the spectrum of tools listed here on my 12 Pro Max - including drafting all of this guide, itself, as well as the vast majority of my [iPhone × Music overview](https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps) - I can’t say I expect to continue using my cellular phone in this way except for any special away-from-desktop circumstances.

![WriteFreely for iOS](https://i.snap.as/gafzIWuT.png)

## Composing
The most logical layout of this guide, I think, is by order of the tasks you’re most likely to spend the most time engaged upon first, with the essential consideration of how likely you might be to actually whittle away on said task _using your iPhone_. Composition, then - that is, pounding out the actual copy - is where we’ll begin. The original design for WriteFreely (including its iOS app) intended for users to simply compose directly within its interface. From my observations of and conversations with other Write.as/WriteFreely users, the vast majority of content published to date on the platform was, indeed, composed directly to its own editor. Those of you who find this entirely sufficient might choose to stop right here! You will undoubtedly find a far less distraction-stuffed, generally more peaceful writing experience.

For the rest of us, WriteFreely for iOS still serves as the ideal method of interacting with our Write.as blogs. Technically, our only requirement, then, is that our final publish-ready text be in Markdown format (along with a handful of Write.as-specific considerations, which we’ll cover shortly.) To actually compose the text, one’s options are vast. There’s a special place in my heart for [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447) and developers, Shiny Frog, who are notably in the process of developing an entirely new editor for Bear from the ground up. I am currently using agiletortoise’s ever-venerable and exceptional [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471), which is quite possibly the most extendable text manipulation software available on any platform. Both of these are optionally Markdown-native and feature-packed, but one needn’t necessarily go their Big, Premium Writing Solution way. Sam Oakley’s [Pretext](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pretext/id1347707000) is an elegantly simple Markdown editor that works directly within iOS native Files app as is Marco Albera’s [Typewriter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/typewriter-for-markdown/id1556419263). (Being spoiled for choice in terms of clever iOS text editors is a precious situation which we should do our best not to take for granted.) For those intending to integrate Git into their workflow, this ability handily removes a few barriers.

![The Non-Markdown-Native Options](https://i.snap.as/QtNWXN6f.png)

Trust me, I know intimately just how weighty personal preference can sit against logic/time/sound advice when it comes to text editing/word processing software. Though I would all but _insist_ you give Markdown the olé college try and then some, if you’re simply too attached to another format - Apple Notes, Notion, or even Microsoft Word, for instance - WriteFreely and I _can_ accommodate you. (Frankly, though, as a WriteFreely/Write.as user, forgoing Markdown is sortof missing the point…) The latter is going to be the most problematic, by far, necessitating (in my opinion) pandoc to form any sort of coherent workflow. An academic named W. Caleb McDaniel detailed [his pandoc-on-iOS process](http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~wcm1/pandoc-on-ios.html) way back in 2013, though the apps/services listed are all astonishingly still available.

### WriteFreely-Specific Considerations in the Body
When I first started playing around with a free Write.as blog, years ago, perhaps the first “quirk” of the CMS to trip me up was its complete separation from the suite’s image-hosting counterpart, Snap.as. The fact that one had to upload to Snap.as, actually _copy the embed code_ and paste it in the intended Write.as post - without any sort of pre-publication preview of how it’d look in the body - all seemed very incomplete to me. As the new Write.as editor begins to implement directly uploading, today, however, I have been begging for this old method to remain untouched because it is actually _absolutely ingenious_. When I need to add an embedded image to the current Drafts Draft I’m composing in now, for instance, I can upload it straight to Snap.as, copy the Markdown embed code (here’s the full embed code for the image embedded above, for example: `![The Non-Markdown-Native Options](https://i.snap.as/QtNWXN6f.png)`), and paste it right here, locally, just as it will be in the final draft. When I use Drafts’ preview function, it loads the image directly from Snap.as - from the very same place your browser loaded it when you navigated to the finished Post. This method reduces waste and makes my text *ridiculously portable* right from the get-go.

My Snap.as image addition workflow on iPhone is made especially smooth by [a single-action Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/71b41b79d9c84a78a3e543502b84ca18) entitled “Snap.as” which I’ve placed on one of my homescreens and customized with the Snap.as logo. Using Google Chrome - which I’ve kept on my device exclusively for this purpose - the Shortcut simply opens the Snap.as homepage (the upload interface for logged-in users.) From there, I can upload any number of images under 12.5 mb and add them to one of my loosely-organized [Galleries](https://snap.as/extratone). I then navigate to the gallery holding the new image, add a caption, and copy the embed code. Once I have that code stored in my clipboard manager of choice (we’ll talk more about those eventually,) I am _completely done_ with that image! Those of you with WordPress experience will find this magical, I promise.

Embeds on Write.as have been in a state of flux since Matt [first announced](https://micro.baer.works/we-now-support-rich-media-embeds-on-write-as-as-always-i-tried-to-keep-this) Embedly integration earlier this year. The intention behind this change was to eliminate the need to mess around with html/iframe code and allow one to embed a piece of content from [a specified list of sources](https://github.com/embedas/go-embed) by simply including its raw, unaccompanied URL in the text. As of this moment, the sources _I_ regularly use are all functioning superbly: Twitter, YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and Imgur. Notably, one must use full YouTube links (`youtube.com/watch?v=qVvSZv9g3oQ`) for videos to embed. The “Expand URL” Shortcut found in the default Siri Shortcuts gallery can be used to convert the `youtu.be` shortlinks outputted by the YouTube for iOS app into these full URLs.

I have found tremendous success in embedding simple HTML5 audio players using `<audio>` pointed directly toward .mp3 files hosted on GitHub.

Well folks, this is my masterpiece. It is a 25-action Siri Shortcut designed for those (all-too-frequent, in my case) situations when you’ve lost track of where you last set your handset down, but you’re pretty sure it hasn’t wandered out of the house - probably not even out of the room.

In such a scenario - as long as one has Hey Siri enabled - the Shortcut will respond to “Hey Siri!!... Marco!”

The idea for this Shortcut dates back to iOS 12 Beta - when I first encountered Siri Shortcuts. For whatever reason, it didn’t take long for me to want a sort of call-and-return Shortcut for those (far too numerous) cases when I’d left my iPhone somewhere obscured in the room.

1. Turn Low Power Mode OFF
2. Turn Airplane Mode OFF
3. Turn Wi-Fi On
4. Turn Bluetooth On
5. Set brightness to 100%
6. Turn Do Not Disturb OFF
7. Turn appearance Light
8. Set playback destination to iPhone
9. Set volume to 89%
10. Vibrate device (Not currently working.)
11. Play **my voice** saying “Polo!” + a few other items
12. Toggle (flash) the flashlight 5 times (odd number leaving your flashlight on constantly unless it was on before the Shortcut was triggered)
13. Simultaneously (in the same repeat action) plays three separate classic Mac sounds 5 times.

# Satya Nadella’s Closing Remarks - Windows 11 Event

I’m really excited to be here with you all. Today marks a major milestone in the history of Windows. It’s the beginning of a new generation. I’m excited by what we have shown you today and how we are reimagining everything from the operating system itself to the browser to the store and the feed.

And I want to reflect briefly on how we got here. Throughout its history, Windows has been a democratizing force for the world. Windows has created entirely new categories for both consumers and businesses. It’s led to many of the world’s most successful software categories, from communications and productivity to design and business applications, each of which has created their own ecosystems. The web itself was born and grew up on Windows. It’s driven silicon innovation device innovation. It’s enabled so many people — including hobbyists, developers, and entrepreneurs — to all dream big; turn their ideas into reality; and monetize their creation.

Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers.

With Windows, you can consume apps and build apps. You can play games and design games. You can buy a PC and build a PC. You can join your community and create your community. You can buy from a business and start your own business. With Windows 11, we have a renewed sense of Windows’ role in the world. As I look ahead, I see three clear opportunities.

First, Windows recognizes that there is no personal computing without personal agency. Personal computing requires choice, and we need to nurture and grow our own agency over computing itself. We want to remove the barriers that too often exist today and provide real choice and connection.

We need to be empowered to choose the applications we run, the content we consume, the people we connect to, and even how we allocate our own attention. Operating systems and devices should mold to our needs, not the other way around. That’s why we are making it easier for you to connect with the people you want, the content you want, the apps you want across all devices you want.

Second, Windows is the stage for the world’s creation. As a creator, every time you pick up a Windows device, it becomes a stage for your inspiration, so you can dream big and create something profound and lasting. Creation is going through a sea change as the balance between consumption and creation changes.

With this new generation of Windows, we are unleashing the innovation and ingenuity inherent in each of us. We want to foster these virtuous loops between content, consumption, and commerce — driven by communities for everyone. These cycles should flow freely, giving people frictionless access to apps, files, games, movies, shows, content, and communities that matter to them. We want to empower you to produce and inspire you to create. It’s why we’re introducing a complete new user experience in helping you be more productive.

And finally, Windows isn’t just an operating system; it’s a platform for platform creators. It allows for the broadest of design spaces, enabling people to build their own businesses and communities.

Today, the world needs a more open platform, one that allows apps to become platforms in their own right. Windows is a platform where things that are bigger than Windows can be born, like the web. That’s our aspiration with Windows 11, to be the platform for the next web, the next transformational software category, the next personalized content business.

A platform can only serve society if its rules allow for this foundational innovation and category creation. It’s why we’re introducing new store commerce models and policies, and creating new opportunities for local publishers, and supporting even more apps with Android apps on Windows.

This is the first version of a new era of Windows. We’re building for the next decade and beyond. And when I reflect on those chapters to come, I’m reminded of an analogy from a 19th century philosopher who compared creators to objects in our Solar System. He wrote about meteors that flash but fade away. Planets that burned longer, but whose energy is confined to their own orbit — and compared them to stars that are constant and light the path of their own.

That’s our ambition with Windows: to help other stars and entire constellations to be born and thrive. I am incredibly proud of what Windows has achieved and how it is fostered lasting opportunity for others. And I look forward to seeing what you achieve with Windows 11 and how it’ll unlock enduring opportunity for people in the world.

Thank you all very, very much.

But in reality most networks of established service providers are fairly old and a lot of it isn't automated, and even the stuff you can automate or script often runs into unexpected errors when trying to process changes do to software or firmware versions causing conflicts. For example, there is a company called MikroTik, they make routers and switches, they pushed out a firmware update a few years back that changed the configuration syntax, which broke a lot of routers in production. Did they auto update as designed, yes - but did it result in the intended behavior by most users of the product, no

# Keyboard shortcuts on iPad? | Drafts Community Thread

* [Keyboard shortcuts on iPad? - General Discussion - Drafts Community](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/keyboard-shortcuts-on-ipad/10389/3)

## Original
Hi all —

I just randomly (and happily) discovered that I can navigate between drafts on the iPad Pro keyboard using command-option-up/down. I’d love to use shortcuts like this to process my list of drafts, at least to archive or delete them. However I can’t find anywhere in the docs where keyboard shortcuts are listed (maybe due to poor searching skills). Is there such a list somewhere I can learn from?

Thanks,
Ramon

This is definitely *the* place to start, but Drafts is incredibly unique on iOS in that you can pretty much customize keyboard shortcuts entirely, by way of custom shortcuts *per Action*.

The best way to illustrate this might be to simply share my current list of keyboard shortcuts, which I’ve also published in a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/extratone/2e54243a2123ccfa6a37c6e8cc1057e2).

The majority of these are Actions I downloaded via the [Action Directory](https://actions.getdrafts.com/) and manually set/altered their respective keyboard shortcut as per [this documentation](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/editing-actions).


@Felciano I would be more than happy to speak directly about this if you need further help - my big life project right now literally involves documenting Bluetooth keyboard support on iPhone, so it’s pretty darn fresh in my mind.

### @sylumer

@Blue, I would recommend that you don’t add shortcuts to the TAD-* actions directly. When you update the action groups (I try and release at least one update every month), the shortcuts would be wiped out (unless something has changed with the action group updating process). None of the TAD-* actions have keyboard shortcuts set. The recommendation is instead to create your own actions with the icon, name and keyboard shortcut of your choice, and then have a single action step to include the TAD-* action. This effectively gives you a customised alias to the underlying action.

You may also be interested in the TAD-Export Action Shortcut Keys/TAD-List Action Shortcuts. They output the action names along with their keyboard shortcuts for actions with keyboard shortcuts. The exports are just in slightly different formats, and honestly, I’m not sure why they are in different groups or why I ended up with the two formats. I suspect I’ll revisit that in an upcoming update.

To be honest, I had been fiddling with them so much, my plan was to just reconfigure them one-by-one if/when I ended up clearing them with an update but this solution is far too smart to ignore lol. Thank you!

[quote="sylumer, post:4, topic:10389"]
You may also be interested in the `TAD-Export Action Shortcut Keys`/`TAD-List Action Shortcuts`.
[/quote]

The list you see above was exported with the latter (`TAD-List Action Shortcuts,`) which lists the name of the action first, then the command.  `TAD-Export Action Shortcut Keys` is identical as far as can tell except it lists the commands first, then the action. I thought there was a third one which pasted the list into the current Draft instead of creating a new one, but I can’t seem to find it now. Could’ve been dreaming lol.

 ` 2021-06-23 `

Sorta petty I suppose but I finally finished this process - precisely 31 days later lol - and wow! Definitely an illuminating/educational experience. So much so , in fact, that I would absolutely recommend anyone wanting a better familiarity with how Actions work do what I did - create an Action Group just to collect your favorite TAD actions you’ve come across. Even if keyboard shortcuts aren’t involved.

(In case you were wondering, my favorite Action at the moment is [**Load Most Changed Draft**](https://www.thoughtasylum.com/taagd/#tad-load-most-changed-draft) lol.)

# Notes: Podcasting’s Last Month
* Though Apple is no longer the definitive catalog of Podcast RSS feed links (and it’s no longer called iTunes??) their ownership of the term compounded with how long they *held out* on monetization support an important declaration:
* …this is it… This is the moment when “Podcasting” - the medium I have known and partaken heavily in throughout my adult life and a good ways before… the one which has been defined for 20 years by the resolute steadfastness of its singular delivery protocol (RSS)… the one which allowed for tactical bros talking about airsoft into their $15 USB headsets from their garages and recordings of syndicated radio broadcasts from its most infamous historical figureheads to exist side-by-side with uncomplicated equality… this is as definitive as its End’s beginning could possibly get.

> As interesting as Apple's platform looks (and we'll get to that in a second), there's a major component it's lacking: The company will not be providing podcast creators with their subscribers' details. 
> That means no names, no emails, no way to reach out to subscribers outside of the podcast content. Creators won't know who is paying to listen to their show — even though Apple will.
> **The creator/subscriber relationship is key to a podcast's success**
> This is a huge drawback for many independent podcast creators, especially, where listeners aren't always necessarily paying for extra content, they're paying for access. They offer their support in order to connect with their favorite podcasters and sometimes even receive personalized bonuses.

> Podcasts Subscriptions
> Based on some of the online conversations I've seen, I suspect this may not be a popular opinion with some of my fellow podcasters, but I like what Apple has done with Podcasts Subscriptions. The system is incredibly flexible, accommodating free, freemium, and paid business models along with features like free samples, bonus content,  episodes, early releases, and back catalogs. I also like the ease with which users can go from listening to a free version of a show to a paid subscription in the same place that they download and listen to shows.
> The program doesn't require exclusivity either. Podcasters are free to offer subscriptions and other paid options outside Apple Podcasts if they want.
> Of course, there are elements that aren't ideal. Thirty percent for the first year of a listener's subscription is a steep fee. The behind-the-scenes process of uploading a WAV or FLAC file version of episodes is more manual than I'd hoped, too, but unless you produce a lot of shows, a few extra minutes of transcoding audio and uploading it with a web form isn't the end of the world.
> I suspect that a lot of podcasts that have already invested the time and effort to build their own subscriber systems won't bother to use Apple's system. Still, I think a few will adopt it as an additional channel for Podcasts users who value the convenience of using their Apple ID to make an In-App Purchase. I also expect newer shows that haven't begun subscription plans will adopt it too. Although it's not for everyone, on balance, I think the availability of another way for podcasters to turn listeners into subscribers is a positive.

## Anchor
* _Extratone_’s channel was the first featured channel in Anchor’s original Music section, which I only bring up because of how hilariously irrelevant that all is now. It is absolutely ridiculous 

Anchor is an absolutely textbook case of Big Tech’s seemingly infinite capability to acquire super clever tools made by small, cool teams with sincere and original ideas and “redeploy” their functions “at scale” in the worst possible way. In turn, it is also an example of Spotify’s particularly dangerous worldview.

* Revisit the ingenuity of Anchor’s original publishing tool _as well as_ the absolutely nonsensical shit.
* This Toot is probably going to end up making more sense as the Extratone Radio example embed: `https://mastodon.social/@DavidBlue/106162023198796037`

# Most Intriguing iOS Apps

## An ongoing list of links to iOS apps, App Stories, and greater media coverage.

I’ve privately maintained a list like this for as long as I can remember, to be honest, but it’s never been particularly useful to others until now. Though it’ll probably never be alphabatized, standardized, or comprehensively annotated, it *will* be kept relatively up-to-date - certainly for the duration of my iPhone 12 Pro Max long review.

# Map My Drive for iOS
## A single surviving fragment of Fast Boy Phone Dreams.
I feel like it’s been long enough since I last discussed the less technical first chapters of my writing life - when I was sure I was going to spend all of it writing professionally about cars - that any new readers since the beginning of the year who’ve not yet heard or read a single one of my words regarding the automotive industry may find this topic disorienting, but I insist that you stick around, anyway - _especially_ if mobile software, hardware, or accessories, even, are your industry, and you live in California or New York.

On December 22nd, 2019, I caused a car accident while drunk driving and was subsequently arrested. The legal ordeal that followed was very alarming and somewhat frustrating - assuming I ever manage to comprehend it, I’ll tell the story one day - but the relevant anecdote is that I just recently departed the longest period in which I had gone without driving an automobile since I began driving by myself on my father’s farm sometime between 8-10.

# Transcript: “On ‘Identity’”
I just had a realization that should probably be alarming but it it might actually explain something that has really has been unexplained before and that is why I get so dramatic and animated about like one piece of software functioning in a different way than another one that's just right I mean that's like Ultimately special Perspectives that I I think I try to come from for instance writing the is the user experience aesthetic argument in the form of an academic paper attacking Facebook from that direction just being like I'll be on the day that here's what you can actually go see right now and that is a piece of software that is designed unlike software has been designed for ever basically and that is it is not designed to be as easy as not designed to help you accomplish the task that you came to accomplish I think me I've been a little of me 10 years throughout the state is out like why Facebook felt so different than else because I know I'm gonna kill aware of one of what I'm supposed to be doing on software anyway anyway destinations People is it like it's been a pattern and I guess I've been self deprecating self-awareness they just be on it furthers it but like oh yeah who is my astrology I'm stressed out it's like one of my three negative traits the week anyway but whenever I bring you things up like now getting on the elevator on Spotify or whatever this is really a pause and then I just like and then some conversation comes along that's like you need to find your community man I mean I agree sort of but that's the thing man you're saying that you're trying to see what I'm doing by suggesting that I do exactly what I'm doing which is I think that it's it is an identity forming process being probably upset right about the future of one of our most precious like one of our species debatably our species most precious form of expression music artist It's not it's not it's not that it's all of my friends who should now be who would now be comfortably living as professional musicians Anyway OK that's too far off task here's the gist when I just have to except it the shit that I use at least in this point in time that's my darling I guess the choices that I considered arguments that I make and the jokes and all of it that must be my running it's not a It's not product month does this fit that should make sense that's not what I'm talking about all I think of you like better off if I just if I could just like a walk-through frame by frame apps and talk about them that way I would say that maybe I don't know yeah now I feel like I actually lost the inside maybe I just I'm just insane Publicly by the way sad even though I think it's sad I guess like yeah when I when I jump into a conversation and I'm like hey dude I've before you go off and convert back to wordplay press again in your life look at what I found I found the host of my blog who is it they built the software they Jose it's Matt Baer and some others who aren't faceless and not the sense that like they're obviously that they're just yeah I get the sense that they're they've been height they've been working on something for a long time it's gonna be big and I kind of know the shirt anyway And like if you if you really were seeking a simple means of publishing in markdown of proposing from Mark down to the ends of being a static HD also basically that's affordable fast and simple in a way that makes it a bus if you really wanted that then you would've clung to or you would cling to write as rightfully for your life as I have because everything else I promise you it's not I'm not saying that everything else that ever will be it's just it's even going into that conversation means that you failed right if if our goal is to not have to think about the platform Anyway I say this all because the interest that those are mistakes that I waste a lot of my lifetime yeah I think this is it this one of my life my list of recommended Martyn texted us only has one on it it's Typora doesn't that's fine darling yeah

### Thread

- Toot is just a joy to use. It has a little too much sometimes (it actually contains little mini games...which really aren't needed), but the experience of using it has some really clever UI twists. ⏤ by *mikepictor* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
	- Toot’s great, too. That’s what I was using before trying Metatext, and I have absolutely nothing bad to say about it except that it doesn’t feel as “native” as Metatext.

Others I’ve tried:

-	Amaroq: Hasn’t been meaningfully updated in ages.
-	Mast: _So_ much promise, but the author is also writing the popular new Aviary app fo Twitter and seems to be concentrating on that.
-	Mercury for Mastodon: I love it, but iPhone only. It operates in “zoomed in to fill the screen” mode on iPad and that ruins it for me.

Honorable mention:

-	Linky: Not for _reading_ Mastodon, but brilliant for _posting_ to it. It’s my go-to for sharing web pages I stumble across, and I’ve scripted Drafts.app to automate Linky so that I can write a toot in Drafts and easily share it. ⏤ by *GummyKibble* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
		- Toot! and Metatext are definitely my two favorite. ⏤ by *moonizsenpai* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
		- >Linky: Not for reading Mastodon, but brilliant for posting to it. It’s my go-to for sharing web pages I stumble across, and I’ve scripted Drafts.app to automate Linky so that I can write a toot in Drafts and easily share it.

Thank you so much for your thoughts, for one.

For two, I am a Drafts user and would be very interested in that Action if you've shared it publicly. If not, no worries at all. ⏤ by *AsphaltApostle* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
			- It’s an action with a single step:

    linky://x-callback-url/compose?text=[[draft]]

(I have another action to post from my Mac but it’s a lot more complex.) ⏤ by *GummyKibble* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)
- I’m loving Metatext right now. It looks like a native app on both iOS and iPadOS. ⏤ by *GummyKibble* (↑ 6/ ↓ 0)
	- That’s very good to know, thank you! I don’t have an iPad (or easy access to one,) so I particularly appreciate that insight. ⏤ by *AsphaltApostle* (↑ 1/ ↓ 0)
- I’m using Amaroq, which works well but is missing support for polls. ⏤ by *cheesy_the_clown* (↑ 3/ ↓ 0)
- I've been pretty happy with amaroq ⏤ by *Agitated_Rent_2089* (↑ 2/ ↓ 0)

# Why I Didn't Follow You Back

![Twitter Follow Limits](https://i.snap.as/hKqfPWNd.png)

## Twitter's follow limit, the real consequences of "The Ratio," and my social media methodology.

**There is a limit to how many accounts you can follow on Twitter**. It was finally documented in this [official help document](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit), dated March 2019, but for more than ten years, it was implemented without any explanation from the service, and was known only to those of us who'd actually encountered it.

Here's what happens when I try to follow a new account from [@NeoYokel](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel):

https://imgur.com/gallery/GcpLylS

I was only able to verify that this has been the case since October 20th, 2017 - naturally, I didn't bother to note  the actual date I first received that notice.

**If you're a recent follower of mine and you've found this document**, please know that I have seen your expressed desire to keep in touch in some way (which is what following someone "says," I think we can agree,) and have probably responded by adding you to one of my [Twitter Lists](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists). You may have received a notification about this, but if you haven't, it's because I have not yet chosen to make the List to which I added you public. 

I also want you to know that I am available to speak directly about this if you have questions - whether that be on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), by [email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com), or [otherwise](https://davidblue.wtf). Here's my personal phone number: +1 (573) 823-4380

For whatever it's worth, *thanks for the follow*. I hope to hear from you but if I don't, thanks okay, too.

***

A big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the fact that I built my entire adult social life around a single, centralized social media Web Site. I mentioned this in [my Tweetbot 6 review](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review), recently, but - as I also strive to be a more sincere person and spend more time adding value to _others_’ lives - I’ve concluded that it is the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my “Social Media Methodology.” Most of the resulting insights will not be new information, but I continue to encounter greater and greater confusion in the face of my well-meaning behavior online and I have decided to stop disregarding it. 

This is _not_ an essay about how to “optimize” your social media use. If anything, it is a sort of manifesto against the very idea of designed online behavior beyond simply **being considerate** in a sense that predates even the spoken word. I, myself, have occupied a position well on the _chaotic_ side of the spectrum. You could say I have been mostly _chaotic neutral_ throughout my 12 years on Twitter thus far, and am actively working toward (and advocating for) _chaotic good_.

## Assumptions at bat
1. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will *ever* result in a substantial accumulation of money/"influence" (which seems to be the diluted zag of "POWER" of the moment.) Those interested in learning about "marketing" should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to *start* with Twitter - this I can say with certainty. 
2. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user's choices/methodology to produce results which we *have*, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was *not* created as a *game to be won*. Perhaps more importantly, the "prize" of "winning" in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, "influence," relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.
3. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with _both_ strangers and friends in a manner which generally **adds value to the lives of all involved**.
4. 3 is not only _possible_ - it is easily _reproducible_. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples. 
5. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, **neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media**.

## This is an excerpt with commentary from a guest presentation during the iPad Pro unveiling at Apple's Fall 2015 special event.

It was, indeed, a relatively important one, as arguably the definitive moment leading to the relationship between Apple, Inc. and Microsoft constructing the context that makes first watch so crass.

# A Nauseous Plea for iterative terminology 
## Paid iTunes podcast subscriptions really do mark the end of an old, quaint medium called Pod Casts, but that’s okay. I am not.
_Audio is having a moment_, says the cacophony about heavy wood transistor radios humming in the private spaces of a populace under a plague’s siege. In the end, it could only have been the scent of such beautiful desperation to finally lure the money in, followed single-file by the American story, as always. The Undisputed OG of Broadcast Media rises like a Tucson from the embers of ad tech’s Great Crusades not to seek revenge, but to comfort the only known complex verbal species amid their Biggest Babel Breakdown yet. All it requires, truthfully, is a decent _approximation_ of a real two+-sided conversation. Well… An _infinite list_ of such approximations, anyway, to leave playing in the background. To just hear two people taking turns speaking and then listening.

Honestly, I had absolutely zero intention of contributing any more to this _Digital Audio Renaissance_ conversation. Though I have been stipulating about _The Fateful Day_ when Apple might finally give in to its perception of competition and implement any sort of paid/premium content differentiation function in its directory of RSS feeds as the certain beginning of The End of the medium we recognize as “Podcasting,” I still didn’t consider the recent news of this day’s scheduled manifestation worthy of another meta-media post. Nay, it wasn’t until I overheard a _Windows Weekly_ host describe podcasting as a “new medium” with apparent sincerity at some point within its [**seven hundred twenty-first** episode](https://twit.tv/shows/windows-weekly/episodes/721) that I truly lost my mind.

My third, fourth and fifth eyes all opened wide, and I realized **he and I were definitely _not_ attributing the same thing to that term, anymore**. You probably shouldn’t already be aware that it’s long been produced by This Week in Tech (stylized popularly as _TWiT_) - which happens to be _the_ oldest podcast-first, for profit media group I can remember - surviving or not. The live, compressed, fucky frame rate image of Leo Laporte sitting alone in a studio-lit room wearing the crown of studio headphones with a mic pointed vaguely at his face is darn near old enough to be considered a _childhood memory_ of mine. I promise to eschew undue idealizing Really Simple Syndication as an open web end in and of itself, but it _Really is_ important in this conversation. {>>Don’t forget to mention just how little the RSS syntax standard has changed in the past twenty years, if it has at all.<<}

`https://twitter.com/ashleyrcarman/status/1384610439519158273`

I am also _not_ bringing up terminology to resist the extreme breadth of audio content which the label Podcast encompasses - this has been an indisputable truth since the very beginning.

## ‽‽‽

*The Psalms* (alternatively/interchangeably entitled *Bilge*) is a monobyline World Wide Web Blog written by David Blue (good morning!) observing and selectively amplifying the characters, organizations, and stories surrounding the most abrupt, profound, and spectacular communicative renaissance in the history of the human species. 

Less abstractly, its beat is **wholly digital**, namely in **tools** (software, services, and methodologies) and **culture** (music, film, podcasts, and media) from a distinct lens established at good distance from California.

It is [unlicensed](https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1) and entirely [written in public](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/) largely via [**this GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge), supplemented by experiments on a variety of [other platforms](https://www.notion.so/rotund/9fdc8e9610b34b8f991ebc148b760055?v=c170b58650c04fbdb7adc551a73d16a7), including (arguably) [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel).

For better or worse, my voice as represented in _The Psalms_ has continued to be saturated with self-referential and occasionally self-disparaging/deprecating qualification. If I am indeed an authority on myself, I would suggest that these are essential tools rather than crutches, and note that I have made some progress in excusing myself for them out of the (perhaps cliché) realization that “life” - and especially _truth_ - can be infinitely complicated, and therefore worthwhile thought on just about anything is inevitably going to be (sometimes aggravatingly) tedious in its complexity.

**I am not a paid journalist** and **I don’t break stories**. That’s not to say that I wouldn’t if an opportunity happened upon me, but it is not where I’m at my best.

On that note, perhaps the single defining issue I’m contending with in life, right now, is the suddenly slight reframing of how I understood my most fundamental drivers 

### What does *The Psalms* cover?

Primarily, this blog exists to amplify [undercovered](http://bit.ly/undercovered) developers, musicians, writers, curators, and media professionals, most often through the process of **analyzing their work**. 

Some recent examples include [my interview with Brad Varol](https://anchor.fm/davidblue/episodes/Brad-Varol--Father-of-Whyp-es12ge), who’s creating a handy web tool for sharing audio (replacing Clyp) and [my guide to music apps on iPhone](https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps).

Two more _significant_ examples: [my interview with Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview) and [my huge case for Bandcamp](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music) as the streaming service we’ve all been asking for.



### How do you see the world?

Anyone _truly_ curious about the answer to this question, for whatever reason, should read my very-autobiographical essay “[Why I Write About Technology](https://bilge.world/why)” from 2018, though my perspective has changed quite significantly in the time, since. 

I’m going to take further queue from Casey Newton’s about page format and list a few important assumptions of mine about consumer technology in bullet point form:
* The delivery of technology media to the mainstream has lessened its ability to truly write critically about the big tech companies it now shares office buildings with.
* The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their _brand image_ (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important contributions from the average user. Technology media has failed in their responsibility to address this issue.
* Women have had a more than equal share in building the digital age and have yet to be recognized for it. 
* Black people have important contributions of all sorts to technology that have yet to be recognized.
* The software development community is a source of insights in many aspects of life _other than technology_. It is also often hopelessly blind to others. 
* Technology media has failed to discuss consumer technology’s presence in the lives of working class people, to their own detriment.
* The narrative surrounding consumer technology has been allowed by technology media to shift from products toward organizations and figureheads, perhaps inevitably. 
* The power dynamics found in the stories of Software History have thus far been underutilized in technology media’s critical eye on the same elements in today’s narratives.

> A slight addendum: while I think we (folks who are professionally, emotionally, or even recreationally invested and engaged with the media industry) should proceed under the assumption that readers are intelligent and discerning, the reality (as I have observed, living and working among working-class Midwesterners) is quite different. 

We know this, already, but specifically regarding **bylines**…

From what I have observed in the wild, the majority of casual news consumers rarely if ever notice them. As far as they're concerned, anything they happen to read on the new york times dot com, or from the company’s various social accounts, is most definitely written in the voice of *the brand*.

Obviously, much has been said on this issue by meta media authorities here and elsewhere, but the disconnect remains glaring and alarming from where I sit. 

I vaguely remember a conversation I had with a partner on this subject when I was attempting to build a unique digital media company circa 2017: We were tossing very *technical*, UX-ey design solutions around. As in the CSS style of the byline element on an article's webpage… We dropped it, but I think it's worth thinking about **visually reengineering our methodologies of attribution**.

# In Defense of Just Fucking Around

[Notes Draft](drafts5://open?uuid=876A4982-57E5-4E1F-A874-E83390D4EC60)

## Everything I have learned about computers, I have learned myself, mostly by stumbling about.
After an adolescence and early adulthood spent in flux regarding technology’s integration into my own identity; after years spent occasionally surmising that I could be adept at helping folks figure out their software, I finally got the chance, last year, to see how much I was truly capable of within the context of a real IT business. (I’ll spare you further reading: _not much_.) A friend of mine – once my manager at the second convenience store job I’ve had – managed to get me a support job at a small IT company based in a quaint suburb of Kansas City, co-owned by two old pros, who were also very much _locals who stayed_ in the area. Their clientele was predominantly made up of the city’s municipal organizations – fire, police, works, etc. – along with much of the local heavy industry. Technically, two companies shared the same office (and resources… and at least one employee:) the software development company – the one my friend technically worked for – that provided bespoke, very technical management software for cement plants, and the IT company, which was almost singularly run by the older of the two partners. 

That’s the extent I knew about the job when he first called me for an interview, asking a less diverse variety of screening questions than one might expect regarding my related knowledge. I cannot remember any of them specifically, but I do remember essentially answering “uh… well I don’t know, but here’s how I would find out” to many of them – perhaps too many, in retrospect. This IT boss – whom I’ll call Tim – who was known to be so discerning, was somehow convinced by my friend – whom I’ll call Jake – that I knew enough to be worth trying out, despite how poorly I felt I performed in the interview. Thank you, Jake!

A few weeks later, I packed up my clothes and moved in to Jake’s little house, less than two miles from the business, under the premise of a trial period. The next three months would be a trial for all of us in more ways than we could’ve imagined. For myself, Tim’s management style – full of machismo, paranoia, and threats – would be a test of a supposition about myself: that I could work under any boss, no matter how technically “good” they may or may not be. For Tim, I seemed to represent some profound risk to his business because of my failure to generate “billable hours,” which is largely why I’ve begun with this story. For Jake, as immediate observer of the situation, it caused much turmoil (which I regret,) considering he was just hoping to get a roommate and similarly-aged colleague out of the deal.

In terms of my performance as a “support specialist,” I think all of us could agree that it was profoundly hindered by the nature of my philosophy of use regarding technology. _Just Fucking Around_ does not lend well to solving IT problems in a timely, reassuring, and fundamentally billable way. In fact, I think one could even go so far as to deem it _irresponsible_ in such a context, but the experience taught me a lot about myself, for better or worse. It also resulted in at least one solution which I daresay no other process could’ve found involving a privacy setting buried deep within some ancient business printing software. This, I suspect, was not worth the sum I was paid in those few months to the company, but it may or may not be some miniscule evidence that some problems necessitate a completely undisciplined/unhinged software rascal to solve. (Not enough to launch a business out of, I suspect.)

## Definitions
	Syn: _POKING AROUND_
To be more specific about what I mean by _Just Fucking Around_, I know only to draw upon individual experiences. For instance: when prompted with “what are you doing?” while _Just Fucking Around_, I know I have often struggled to answer articulately. This is perhaps the root of my problem with timesheets: while I am technically capable of walking back into a description of _what I am doing_, it feels unnatural and perturbing. How adjacent does this fact make JFA to the recent evangelism I’ve come across for re-accepting “I don’t know” in day-to-day thought? Well, _I don’t know_. Until/unless another individual contributes to this “philosophy” – by addition and/or peer review – it will remain… something less than a philosophy.

**What does it actually look like?**
Observe a child using just about any given application for the first time, or – if an opportunity to do so is unavailable or inappropriate – imagine yourself as a child encountering an application for the first time. More specifically, a child too young to immediately seek out a search engine in the face of a task they do not understand. 

To be frank, the most important general value this essay should provide for the reader probably lies in its detailed classification of JFA and JFA-adjacent activities, so that they may more quickly identify, contend with, argue against, or even just straight up _avoid_ it, whenever possible. **It is fundamentally the opposing method to accomplish any _specific_ task**

# SoundCloud Go+

title: "SoundCloud Go+"
date: "2020-08-09"

## I’ve got some fucking opinions about SoundCloud...

My girlfriend Sierra has used SoundCloud almost exclusively for her music discovery, consumption, and recommendations, but has remained resolute in her unwillingness to financially invest in the service. As such, her listening is regularly interrupted by ads and limited to bitrates [as low as 64kbps](https://www.magneticmag.com/2018/01/soundcloud-lowers-sound-quality-uploads-half/). Since I was last employed, I have maintained a vow to her that I would pay for a subscription to SoundCloud Go+ - the premium _listener_ tier of the service - with my own money, once I was once again in place at a steady job. This move would remove all advertising from her listening and [up its bitrate to 256kbps](https://help.soundcloud.com/hc/en-us/articles/360010227514-High-Quality-Streaming), among [other benefits](https://checkout.soundcloud.com/go).

Two nights ago, we were refueling her car in preparation for another one of our recreational drives into rural Missouri when I made the decision on a whim to simply signup for a trial of Go+ on [my own account](https://soundcloud.com/chordoslut) using Apple Pay, mostly because I knew we'd be going out of effective cell network range and one of Go+'s most emphasized features is its ability to download music locally. (Since my Apple Music subscription expired earlier this year, I only have [a single album](https://bigkrit.com/music/king-remembered-in-time/) actually downloaded on my phone.)

* * *

The above is what I wrote several weeks ago, just as I was beginning my trial period. Now, having experienced a significant amount of time as a SoundCloud Go user, I am a bit sad that my trial is over. To be honest, I fully intended to become a paying subscriber, but my PayPal account was $0.70 short of the $12.99 monthly fee when the first billing cycle came, two weeks ago. This is not a conclusion I expected to come to, as SoundCloud's fundamental arrangement could not possibly differ any more from the music streaming service I long claimed as my ideal own: Apple MusicWhile I was surprisingly unable to find any Tweets or Evernotes further evangelizing Apple Music (I suspect I'm thinking of an old, untranscribed _Drycast_ episode,) I found real magic in the service as I perceieved it: $9.99 a month for _all of iTunes_. 13 year-old me would considerthat one helluva deal..

One major worry I would imagine potential subscribers may have when approaching SoundCloud as a replacement for their single music subscription service would revolve around the extent of SoundCloud's establishment music industry library. There's no way your Dad's Sunday barbecue playlist is going to be on _SoundCloud_, right? Strangely enough, I was unable to find a single track that _was not_ in the libraryNaturally, if you know of one, please do comment and/or [drop me a line](https://www.davidblue.wtf/contact/).. From my own favorite [Keith Jarrett's archives](https://soundcloud.com/keithjarrettofficial) to [the new Dixie Chicks album](https://soundcloud.com/dixiechicks/sets/gaslighter-2), every bit of big time record label-distributed music I could conceieve of could be found aside the Go+ badge (though notably, neither of these showed significant playcounts.) As far as the app experience goes, I _swear_ it got smoother as soon as I signed up for Go+. This is probably bullshit, but regardless, with the seemingly ever-widening disparity in the experiences of free vs. premium users, SoundCloud appears to be moving actively away from the former.

### SoundCloud's Desktop Keyboard Shortcuts

I have long said (somewhat in jest) that [Chance The Rapper](https://soundcloud.com/chancetherapper) is the only reason SoundCloud still exists.

> From a future historian’s perspective, the battle for the definitive name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who’s quickly become a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my generation’s upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud _earned_ his partnership or landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to [give new meaning](https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper) to the phrase “serially likable.”
> 
> "Bandcamp: Streaming's Secret Savior" | July, 2018

If [_CNET_ was asking the question](https://www.cnet.com/news/chance-the-rapper-soundcloud/) a year before that Bandcamp essay, I think I can feel properly varified. What I'd really like to know, now: does Chance still feel the same way about the streaming service after the launch of SoundCloud Go+? Considering that I am far from a _real_ music journalist, I do not have any more contact resources than you have. That said, I left [a comment on his Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/chancetherapper/posts/3299672310124810?comment_id=3319045628187478&__cft__[0]=AZVwHKj7Db1EJxvu5l-xa4hb-aW_Fv-fvaUXzepPQ24DfitI9jwAxeplWqKkQde9oc2LGBRquP8cYgMJ6I3bvtjIigkpjULs0ZJc7xrLEeyie2QSyQ1W2rZSaoSfm4pikn7vQrEXXUNJFwaE5WbEfYelyKWZAqQBQH7PEpRaJeU9NeeVP65oR0YA5OOeH_GfWlmSisfB7yNuoUpWgpiwsla0&__tn__=R]-R). I guess we'll see.

Some more technical bits: SoundCloud is now castable on Chromecast, but _not_ supported by Apple CarPlay, for whatever that's worth.In fact, it is the only streaming app I found that _does not_ have CarPlay support. Even Bandcamp and MixCloud for iOS do! Notably apart from Bandcamp and Apple Music and aligned with Spotify, SoundCloud is explicitly investing in algorithmic music discovery, which means its users are doing the curatorial work. _I_ am doing/have done the curatorial work. That means the DnB crowd is going to receieve Toto recommendations, given what I sought out for this post. You're welcome, and sorry...

# Why I Write About Technology

![Why](https://i.snap.as/OXW0FOqh.jpeg)

[May 22nd, 2018](https://bilge.world/why)

## An autobiographical overview of my personal history with technology and its contributions to my current perspective.

Incalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening in early 1994, positioning my life within a timeline that would allow me to bridge my two species’ most significant millenniums in the first grade as a student in the first class at Fairview Elementary school to receive curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab in the center core of its 50-year-old rectangular brick structure. The lab also meant that ours was the first Fairview class to have the available relief of air conditioning during the school day. It’s unlikely that I would be home sick and watching the last television ever allowed in my mother’s living room as the second plane hit.

My peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps we should be called the 9/11ers) — 91s and 92s wouldn’t have regular access to public school machines until they’d eclipsed the true prime of their development, and were just that much further along, mentally, to being able to comprehend the huge and terrifying concepts of 1) New York and 2) burning alive — while 98s like my niece were spared any such comprehension of death at all, yet now have to face the existentially future-sundering, darkly-mirrored reality of the Trump Presidency during the most critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain’s transition to adulthood.

If there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls have some sort of choice, pre-conception, over when they’re born, my own must have either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible, though I suspect I’ll never be able to confidently wager either way. This question of *how lucky or unlucky am I to be alive right now* is one which I find most fascinating — not just within myself, but within others my age. I declare us a generation largely because of my experiences under the assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing represents the ultimate average in the American experiences of the time as the area has been a reliable sample of the clearest average of the country’s cultural, political, and economic life. Technically, it was quite unlikely that I arrive here as a new human being instead of China or India, and what if that, too was my choice?

Though less so, it was still against chance that I would be born to parents who would divorce very quickly after my birth, before my mind was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing me whatever pain could’ve resulted from their greater togetherness later nullified in front of me. I could’ve chosen them as well for the variety of experiences their situation would allow me as I grew up between my father’s 800-acre farm and my mother’s suburban house in Columbia, the college town an hour’s drive south. I write about my experiences now — so young — because I’ve likely already born witness to more extraordinary changes in human development than your parents, their parents, and their parents’ parents combined. At 24, my life has already spanned by far the most profound and expedited informational renaissance in human history — greater progress was made between the day I first rode a bicycle and the one on which I took my driver’s test than in thousands of years before it.

The sum of my father’s ordeals between 1950 and 1974 — from his birth until the age I am now — would indeed include watching a man set foot on a spatial body other than Earth for the first time, but would be mostly defined by work on the family’s soybean, corn, and wheat farms in central Illinois, driving carbureted tractors pulling cultivating equipment of the same basic design and function as had been pulled by horses, mules, and oxen for hundreds of years, and other implements — like the mechanical multi-row planter — that were new technology at the beginning of the century. For neighbors, he would walk behind the path of a square hay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer, upon which he would throw the 70–100 lb. rectangles of dead compacted grass by their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would get to experience in the next century on *his* farm, using the exact same equipment.

At home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT TV, as I would for several years until wireless television was legally transitioned to digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an adolescent, he would form a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns in exchange for the rights of ownership to any finds inside, which led to his discovery of a hay-preserved 1929 Buick Sedan containing hand-written records of its every service. This car would change hands into his Uncle’s care as he went off to school in Champaign, married in Georgia, and eventually settled on the flat clay soil of the farm where I grew up, right on the border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about 10 when we drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to collect the car from my Great Uncle, to my manic excitement.

Up until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence for historic cars, airplanes, tractors, and watercraft, and the time I spent operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying the assortment of these which I was allowed — often because of extraordinary circumstances — would form the component of my psychology which seeks to experience different cultures, ideas, and eras through the medium of engineering and design and relies on these to understand them. Like my father in his youth, I would learn to clean water out of a carburetor after the Oliver 88 had sat silent for too long, and I would piss in a chamber pot to avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down creaking attic stairs and turning the lights on. I would learn how to shoot and drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both as I pleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home.

Though my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my first-grade computer class was ending, I could not conceive of a reason to occupy the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or faxes, so my use of the machine was limited to sparse writing and aggravating attempts to run Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 at approximately one frame per second on a 300MHz single-core Pentium II CPU. Though I was *extremely* fortunate compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my own computer in my room, my relationship with it was not significant or particularly involved. I would leave it powered down for weeks at a time until my last two grades at Fairview, when homework assignments began to require it.

Perhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates and I was an exposure to Japanese entertainment and video games. I was once disallowed from a lunch table because I’d never heard of Pokémon or Luigi, but I *did* have a Sony Playstation at home on which I occasionally loaded *A Bug’s Life* to wander around its first level, perhaps in basal awe at the idea of manipulating what I saw on a screen in realtime. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I wouldn’t develop any need to be socially competitive with video games as many of my peers would to carry with them into adulthood. I thought my interests in mechanical engineering to be above all of them, so I spent my time alone with heavy picturebooks on 20th century cars, tractors, and airplanes.

On the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was one of the first to have satellite internet for farm futures and weather reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don’t remember. As I was becoming computer literate in school, he would become extremely frustrated with the Windows XP-running machine he’d bought from a one-man, one-room computer shop in Centralia, and I would often solve some problem with bloatware or the goddamned printer. He would also subscribe to and install a first-generation DirectTV receiver, which had the first on-screen program guide I’d ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch hours of *Modern Marvels* on The History Channel, which presented the history, abstract functional theory, and implementation of a particular technology, both past and future. This single program — which has aired nearly 700 episodes since 1995 — is probably responsible for the majority of my at least rudimentary general knowledge in a variety of historic and “future” technological schools, and my curiosity about culture’s relationship with innovation.

Though my father’s interests differed significantly from mine — he thought more about growing and raising than of the tools one used to do it — he would indulge my many questions about how engines, hydraulics, and electrical systems worked, and indulged my curiosity by exposing me to the hidden communities of the most elderly, most obscure historic machinery enthusiasts like those of the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in Mount Pleasant, Iowa — the Concours d’Elegance for antique tractor and reciprocating engine collectors. It was a similar event closer to home where I first operated a steam tractor — great, field-going locomotive-like vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the late-1800s up until the Great Depression which chug, whistle, and puff along just like rail locomotives with a huge, gritty, iron steering wheel. As I recall, I was also given the opportunity to drive an unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day — the knowledge from which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use ever again.

I was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge and experience in all the different things I had driven and operated, which my schoolmates were in no position to understand. I was elitist and anti-social about this as late as 8th grade, when I had just moved in to stay with my mother, who bought me a first generation iPhone which I proudly wore in a leather belt holster to Junior High. It would represent a shift in my fascination from very old technology toward the present and future.

I started talking online with a friend I’d first met years before at Fairview, who spent most of his time fiddling with his first-generation MacBook Pro. He originally exposed me to gadget bloggers on YouTube like Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger (both of whom are still full-time tech personalities.) My mom bought me a 13-inch aluminum-bodied MacBook (which would be sold as MacBook Pro after a single year,) and my lifestyle radically shifted inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox 360. My friend and I would both obsess together over software, design, and gadget - experimenting with our own tech YouTube channels until high school, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would finally socialize me.

Recently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected from the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for the End User in a departure which has been especially visible from my perspective as an academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user in the past five years. When hardware was still the industry focus before ~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among journalists and enthusiasts because each successive generation of devices had added more tangible capabilities. Publications like *Gizmodo* and *Engadget* made a fortune publishing reviews and comparison tests of hardware offerings across every segment of tech, and the discourse they generated had a noticeable influence on design. I remember this time well because it accented my last few years before adulthood, when I had plenty of spare time, energy, and curiosity to keep up.

The general consumer technology narrative since Steve Jobs’ death has become increasingly more about the companies who design and sell hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actually use them, and the result has been a series of new product segments with little defensible place in my own linear timeline of innovation, especially where productivity is involved. Augmented and Virtual Reality are quite explicitly escapist industries, yet to fill any significant need which was before unfilled. The same could be argued about voice assistants and smartwatches — neither of which *remove* obstacles in most users’ day-to-day lives but instead *contribute* to the array of tasks and devices which already seek their attention.

Of course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind the industry’s new, fragmented direction, but I would also argue that there are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both _what we should be doing_ and what we should be seeking to _learn to do_ with technology. In a more abstract sense, I have written about whether or not we should want to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel about the future should inform what we do in the present.

I cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of powerlessness, acute alienation, and amused awe, which has already lent to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts as I watch, having witnessed an odd diversity of American life and culture. I’ve published them to entertain and to demonstrate a few methods of reflection on what it is *you* really want from the times you are living.

# Mark Fuck and the Goofy Godheads

![Mark Fuck](https://i.snap.as/TP5r1uV.jpg)

## The monumental amount of unsubstantiated gossip and conjecture enabled every day by Facebook is lethal to the human intellect. Can fire be fought with fire?

Today, after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the namesake of the battleship *Bismarck*, I was told by its owner - a local woman of a far-from-excusable age - that "[I] should be on that big bang show." Upon such fuckery, I looked her in her eyes and informed her that she'd just changed my plans for the night: I was now going to go home, wrap my lips around the barrel of my Beretta, and blow my brains out. I should've known better than to so jest with a boomer immediately after receiving such glaring indicators of minimal intellectual function, but I fell for the hope - as I often do, to no avail - that such a jarring reaction would encourage reflection on her foul, tragically misled sentiments regarding the general state of youth, and perhaps even spare a peer or two from future tribulation.

Instead, she called the police.

Three round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly. Strangely enough, they were chuckling - maybe to a little joke about all the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of blatantly negligent medical care in American prisons, though I hope nervous laughter is just *SOP* when responding to a suicide threat. As all Columbia cops always are toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and hilariously understanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and - I swear to my new Lord - all three immediately released a choral "ohhhhh" in unison. I'll never know for sure if they actually assimilated the reality of the situation so quickly, but it'd certainly seem that way.

Clearly, I should've threatened *her* life.

Despite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms, habits, instincts, patterns and cycles of cultural metamorphosis in the discourse, the stream of "well, you know they were sayin' the world was going to end when *I* was in elementary school" to my ear has fallen abruptly silent since the inauguration. Our parents and grandparents are both impossibly fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the most multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of mankind will just've begun nibbling on the slope to its climax. We'll be lucky if we'll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by the time they reach the door. Nonsense does a fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but the gaps *are* widening at a dangerous pace. Tectonic or domestic, we are all straddling expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now stealing too much of our heat to ignore.

Though it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,) it would not be *well-to-do* of me now - nor was it, then - to leave the conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a part of me would like to campaign for *Sheldon* to be reclassified as an expletive, in disgust, but - as an adult in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional development - I must note that such a display of concern should've been at least reciprocated with a bit of explanation, if not appreciation. Still, there are much more appropriate reasons and situations in which to waste public servants' time.

It's not news - the *Theory* is providing *some* ghoulishly skewed portrayal of less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior's time was worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent any quantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly mainstream generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded - if stretched - as the result of a curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value, as of late. It is undiscouragable. Read the trail a bit, and you'll find that your frustration is simply an expression of the terror that's ignited by the stagnancy of their pace.

*It's great that you've managed to inch over to modern-ish sitcoms from Judge Judy and* Independence Day *, mom, but you're gonna have to* ***really pick up the pace*** *and work on following a few body modification communities on the darknet.*

If an absence of *solutions* are the crux of the *blog*, here I'm now gloating.

To whom does the commoner look to for such solutions when they'd prefer not to terrorize their kooky middle age parents into a half century of brutal fasting under vows of silence?

The Big Thinkers!
The Men of the Hour.

Yes, *men.* All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles.

Elon Musk *cannot* be the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the *20th*, for that matter, because literally *every* mechanically-minded professional I've ever heard talk about battery technology has condemned it in some manner as an inescapable dead end, developmentally. Perhaps, then, the champion of electrochemical storage is *the* False Prophet.

No, I'm not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable spacecraft, but I've been a bit too preoccupied with my country's class war and its [10% adult illiteracy rate](http://bit.ly/unescoliteracy). It's all well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it's not the 1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would be more concerned for the wellness of the species than our continued reach for the stars, were he still alive.

Well. Maybe not...

Charles Lindbergh would be, though.

We spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because the smartest among us foresaw some facsimile of the renaissance we are currently experiencing. If they'd been shown a glimpse of [some statistics](http://bit.ly/measuringconsumerinfo) on the volume of media we consume, they'd exclaim of their pride - no doubt - in their species' capability to progress, and perhaps even their own contribution to it. However, extended observation of an average American's day-to-day life would be lamented, in disgust, and a [huge portion](http://bit.ly/millennialspew) of the blame can be placed on one t-shirt-touting cyberyokel: Mark Zuckerberg.

His name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to insist upon saying shit that frightens the bejesus out of me.

[Zuckbrain](https://backchannel.com/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3) is fucking scary.

"[Wiring the globe](http://bit.ly/zuckfuck)" is fucking scary.

[Jarvis](http://bit.ly/zuckbot) is fucking scary.

But Fuck, himself wouldn't be at all intimidating without his money. The scariest bit is the lack of *class* in the criticisms of his intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo's [attention](http://bit.ly/fuckbug) has been diligent and premium as a *Times* er's should be, but the same occupation bars him from authoring with the color of unsubstantiated claims.

Mine does not.

Elon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He's willing to [joke](http://bit.ly/aloofmusk) about his intellectual distance from the planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind's even surpassed the need to punctuate. Crazy.

Google is well on it's way to becoming the neo-Vatican... yada yada yada, but they're too far gone - I do not have the expertise to address them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, *Even Stevens* -haired young man [without](http://bit.ly/crowdfuck) so much as private office space (even though his sentiments on breathing room at home are [obviously inverse](http://bit.ly/fuckflex).)

Clearly, it's all just to protect him from the truth: **The Apostle John's** ***Book of Revelation*** **is about Facebook**. Fuck's cyberchild is the horseman, the beasts, *and* the plagues, stuffed into one tyrannical website.

> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

If I can *repeatedly* trigger accidental voice calls on Fuckbook Messenger, don't tell me it's not possible to inadvertently live stream myself on the pot.

> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

Of course, it's unlikely that Mark's essence was bred entirely of evil, but - like Tump, in many ways - he is an excruciatingly wealthy idiot. Though he *is* spending 2017 touring the United States, he [doesn't seem](http://bit.ly/fucklearning) to be all that interested in *actually* closing the gap between himself and the rest of us, which suggests that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial, xenophobic scent. I can't imagine what *The Mothership* would really want with my Amazon browsing history, though.

> And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

Just to be clear, **he is not** ***The Antikhristos***.

He'd better not be, anyway.
I'd be absolutely Livid with Lucifer if his choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a Fucking dork.

I mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays, why the Fuck didn't he just build a Fucking CMS back in his Jesse Eisenberg era instead of *the actual* weekly-updated tower of digital Babylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and pulverize creativity by ordering his Demonic Dev team to release regular builds for build's sake rather than on a per-need basis, but that'd be because The Tempter is an authority on *incentive* s as thoroughly as Fuck isn't.

If you’re equipped with the privilege of literacy, you’ve been reading a lot about Fuckbook’s political consequences, recently. Frankly, *it’s about Fucking time*, but I’m compelled to emphasize that the most significant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest, fossilized portions of our thought meat. According to Manjoo, "the News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want," dipping in Facebook's ocean of action data, searching for a soul.

Yet another Fuckism that suggests he's an alien: everybody knows that *nobody* knows what they want. 

There's a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole helluva lot of contradiction. If you've ever mentioned ADHD with your doctor, or know a hypochondriac/adderall fiend who has, you may have heard it described as "the lizard brain." Simply put, it's the brain stem, and it's responsible for the most basal and primitively emotional instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual agitant, arguing at all times for the course of action with the most immediate gratification. *The Great Clickbait War* of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed the strength of the hold Fuckbook had (and still has) on these reptilian bits - the true location of its power.

"In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them?"

*Volition* is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an ancient parable from the wise foretellings of the Disney film, *Smart House*: **when dealing with human beings, boundless compliance quickly leads to abject misery for all parties involved.**

Mindlessly, habitually, endlessly clicking... **this is how we die**.

Something about Fuck's direction is fundamentally poisonous to the human mind. Yes, he *is* assuredly too Fucking democratic, but misinformation is far from the only form of evil his creation has assumed. If you can jog your memory back a bit, you'll remember a much wider variety of brain-rotting filth.

In lapses of their existences' finitude, the 40-something second cousins of the world may still send you the occasional *Can Crunch Saga* invite, jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and forever associating themselves in your mind with the horrors of mortality and **f u c k b o o k  g a m e s.**

Elon is a more likely candidate, but I'll leave those differentiations to the not-idle cult masses.

More than one sixth of all living eyes [see](https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/) Fuckbook every single day, placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most universally human activity.

Mr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest purveyor of words who's ever lived. He's taught (or... is teaching) us something very profound about ourselves: capability is not the whole of the equation. Ability on its own cannot guarantee growth, but it can often result in decay. Discussion does not inherently lead to *connection*. Population is not a cure for isolation.

That said, I must begrudgingly admit to you that I, myself am one of the 100 million users who've depended upon a "very meaningful" Fuckbook group for a "physical support structure" for which I have Fuck to thank.

I've spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies, whirling around die-cast biplanes, seeking out stories from old pilots - military and commercial, and eventually trained to become one myself. As regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained into my identity, but my local community is *very* sparse - it's not exactly *cool*, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial group for members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has allowed me to stay connected to the rest of the world's Soaring Nerds, which is no small deal. It's the only forum which I am compelled to participate in with 100% sincerity and emotional effect.

Photos of members standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of adolescent students in a similar pose after their first solo, or of three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around a fold-up table full of rudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming Stearmans...

They tug around on my heart like nothing else in life can.

I stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the naivety of my childhood perception of what it meant to fly commercially and realized that I was unequipped for- and uninterested in the sort of challenges it presented. I haven't flown in seven years, but the community will *always* have a tremendous dividend of my core being. 

These days, not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares about aviation, which wouldn't be laudable whatsoever - it's not exactly the most relevant goingson at the moment - were it not so *emotionally* necessary for me. 

A few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles Lindbergh's modified Ryan cockpit, captioned "what airplane am I?"

In my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the 'childhood hero' role. My grandmother bought me a first-edition copy of *The Spirit of St.Louis* from a small town bookshop when I was six or seven, and I carried it *literally everywhere* with me until middle school. I watched the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tens of times, and I cried when I saw the *Spirit* in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I've *never* had an informed conversation about any of it with another human being. It really warmed me to see how many of the comments were correct answers. 

Breaking news: it's nice to know that there are other people on Earth who give a shit about the same things you do.

Again - aspiration should always be encouraged. This is Fuck's vision for his creation, and it *is* feasible, even for myself. At least his public persona - however valid or invalid it may be - is making a huge effort to have positive consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing itself within all of humanity.

Fuck is too powerful to be exempted from responsibility for what Fuckbook's done to the Western psyche over the past decade, but - like the Christian god - perhaps all we need require is his repentance.

# Google Will Soon Replace God and The Church

![Googleplex](https://i.snap.as/tCRNZM7.jpg)

## What I have long predicted is now coming to pass: Google believes it should assume control.

Out of all the technology companies that have made my knees knock and my voice hoarse and my [Tweets manic](http://bit.ly/bluegoogle) as a technoheretic in the past several years, Jumbo Google would easily take home the winning trophy for Dystopian of the Millennium. I have been rehearsing an especially dear pet prophecy of mine, unsolicited, to family, friends, and podcast guests since 2011 in which I end up arguing quite convincingly that Google is a dead ringer for the 16th-century Vatican: an inherently self-isolating organization with an absolute monopoly yielding *gargantuan* levels of essentially passive income from a service which nearly everybody transacts with, but only Google understands (and is therefore assumed to be its only possible provider,) which inevitably develops such a distance from the rest of the populace and their way of life (in tandem with total notoriety and celebrity among them all) not intentionally out of malice, but from the delusion of mythically-bestowed philanthropic duty that is borned of and compounded by this economic and cultural isolation in a perpetual accumulation of power and wealth that radicalizes the monopolizers — the majority already highly predisposed to zeal as they would’ve needed to be in order to find themselves in this singular, universally powerful position over every other class — and leaves their egocentric minds to wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow radicalized monopolizers, who together begin to feel more and more comfortable wondering aloud about themselves in increasingly fantastic presumptions: *what if all of this was bestowed upon us because we are superior to them? What if it is our* **divine responsibility** *as superior beings to take charge and shepherd the common people as our sheep — for they cannot possibly know as well as we what is truly best for them?*

You see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of terror that is both awed by the scale of the circumstances created by so few human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of your own inability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even recognize this taste as one perfected by Christianity’s ancient advertising business, but Google knows so much about you that it’s rumored to’ve been selling user data *to* the Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10% discount, and so we extrapolate and anticipate, yes?

Of course, it’s admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to this godfearing place in the most perverse *look what I saw first that you didn’t see because you’re just not as bright but lucky for you, I’m so fucking generous with my wisdom* sort of thinking around which the entire personas and livelihoods of fringe movement fanatics are built upon, but this is my *one* thing, okay? I’ve been waiting years for the right time to formally argue this theory in depth, and — thanks to this year’s public spotlight finally pivoting on the giants who’ve been silently swallowing their competition and relentlessly forcing their already ridiculous margins higher and higher in relative obscurity for decades, the time has come, indeed. The common people’s trust in Google had a godawful week.

## Don’t Be Evil

On Monday, [*Gizmodo*](https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300)[ reported](https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300) that twelve frustrated Google employees were quitting the company in protest of their work assisting the Department of Defense to “implement machine learning to classify images gathered by drones” for the detail fleeting Project Maven, despite some [4000 employee signatures](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html) on a [letter](http://extratone.com/library/dearsundar.pdf) addressed to CEO Sundar Pichai requesting (in full) that he “cancel this project immediately,” and “draft, publicize, and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology,” citing the infamous “Don’t Be Evil” motto, which Google [**then proceeded to remove**](https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393) from its [code of conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20180504211806/https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html) for the first time in 18 years **the day after** the *New York Times* article went to press, on April 5th.

On initial approach to the abstract of this story, from the ass to our thoughts arrives an easy narrative of a Silicon Valley mutiny comprised of twelve brave, conscientious souls who’ve been eaten up inside by their complicity in the filthy deals made by their power-obsessed CEO over scotch and cigars in a dark D.C. study — kept awake for months by the sound of his puffing cackles at satellite images of dead toddlers in a bombed-out street.

*Ah ha*, we say. *That man is no good, and he just wouldn’t listen! They knew they didn’t have a choice… They only did what they had to do…*

The reality of internal disagreements at Google, though, manages to be even more theatrical. The sheer volume of correspondence must surely be beyond anything capable of the enduser’s imagination, so let’s phone a friend: my favorite peek into the day-to-days of inter-Google existence is an [old blog post](http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/01/things-ive-learned-at-google.html) by [Benjamin Tilly](https://twitter.com/btilly) on his first month at the company in which he was compelled almost immediately to describe in great detail how best to “deal with a lot of email in gmail” at peak efficiency using shortcuts and labels.
“As you get email, you need to be aggressive about deciding what you need to see, versus what is context specific.”

Now we have a bit better idea of the *aggressive emailing* that was a sure constant on a normal workday at Google in 2010, so it must’ve been deafening after 8 years of Gmail development as 4000 employees no doubt vented, debated, and decided to organize last month, though without making much headway because the leadership’s response was apparently “complicated by the fact that Google claims it is only providing open-source software to Project Maven,” this new knowledge having *significant* effect on our mind’s image of Sundar Pichai’s activities in Washington: he is now swapping seats with a frustrated Colin Powell in order to install OpenOffice onto his desktop from a flash drive, and we recall that Google’s Googleplex headquarters resembles nowhere in modern life more than a brand new playground built in a design language borrowing heavily from *Spy Kids*. And though these Twelve disciples are unnamed for the moment, a few of them could immediately land book deals by going public, and every single one would always have by default not only the badge of “I landed a job at Google,” (which is really to say *I have hit Life’s maximum level cap*,) but “I worked at Google for a while, but ended up quitting to do something else,” which is guaranteed to make you the most interesting, intellectually superior person present in *whatever* crowd for the rest of your life. The ultra-cool [Sarah Cooper](https://twitter.com/sarahcpr) quit Google to become a comedian and even [got to talk to Kara Swisher](https://www.recode.net/2018/1/10/16871786/sarah-cooper-comedian-google-dick-costolo-kara-swisher-recode-decode-podcast)!
I won’t pretend to understand big tech’s diminutive bastardization of prestige, but “more than 90 academics” jumping to publish an [open letter](https://www.icrac.net/open-letter-in-support-of-google-employees-and-tech-workers/) (adjacent to a huge *DONATE: Support the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots* button) in which they “write in solidarity with the 3100+ Google employees” who’s terrible boss decided to help some lackeys in the Pentagon set up their email and didn’t text back for a whole hour doesn’t sound 100% sincere. Notably, I don’t know how *or why* the fuck 90 people would go about collaborating on a single document, but if it really was managed, they definitely used Google Docs…
At one point, it was fun to think about the history of the friendly side-scroller-playing garage ghouls and dorm dorks who gave *cooky*, *wacko* names to their dot com startups in parody and defiance of the lame-ass surname anagrams on the buildings of their established competitors, but those who’ve stuck around have only done so by becoming expert at SUCKING UP EVERYTHING around them, and it pisses me off every day how worried I am that my species will finally be done in by a company with a name like Yahoo! and be known only to a bunch of adolescent interdimensional silicon blobs 30 million years in the future as *that bipedal race who remained dignified until the last 0.01% of their reign on Earth, when in way less than a single generation, they all just went* **FUCKING INSANE** *and blew themselves up because they suddenly hated all sense.*

“Google” is perhaps the worst of these to have to shout in fear and/or anger in your last moments as it sounds in American English like you’ve startled your subject with a ticklish pinch followed so immediately by an esophagus-busting chokehold that the two events appear simultaneous, and in real English English, it almost always sounds like a parent speaking of a character on a pre-K children’s television programme whom they find quite foul and upsetting, but will manage to refrain from expressing so otherwise because they know that *Teletubbies* shit is the most quickly forgotten stage of television viewership. It’s fascinating how exclusive the word “Google” is to American English because in everything else it really *is* complete nonsense, but lets halt all etymological discussions right now because we’ve only now just finished with Monday.

## The Soul Ledger

On Thursday, all of my Google experiences, suppositions, and [soul-detaching screenshots](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/914767928456749056) were usurped when a thoroughly alarming internal company video called [*The Selfish Ledger*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy) was leaked to *The Verge,* which I watched once then and do not want to watch again for the sake of this piece, but I will. Though the big V has been disappointingly timid for years about editorializing — when tech journalism desperately needs some confident, informed opinion more than ever — Vlad Savov’s accompanying article should be read in its entirety, to which I can add my own terror where he perhaps could not.
The production style is technically identical to that of the very popular thinkpiece-esque, motion-graphics-paired-with-obligatory-sharpie illustrated videos which you find playing at max volume on your mom’s iPad from where she’s fallen asleep on the couch at 9PM, but the repeating stock string soundtrack multiplies one’s discomfort as such that we would all end up in the fetal position without remembering the transition were it not for the appearance of trusty old Dank Jenkins, who’s face I thankfully associate heavily enough with [his infamous ](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352)[*down-and-out*](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352)[ Tweet](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352) to be a welcome respite in attention before the very scary hypothesis for which it’s been buttering me up, as best summed by Vlad:

> The system would be able to “plug gaps in its knowledge and refine its model of human behavior” — not just your particular behavior or mine, but that of the entire human species. “By thinking of user data as multigenerational,” explains Foster, “it becomes possible for emerging users to benefit from the preceding generation’s behaviors and decisions.” Foster imagines mining the database of human behavior for patterns, “sequencing” it like the human genome, and making “increasingly accurate predictions about decisions and future behaviors.”  

The next time the *what if they do something scary* question comes up in a casual conversation about Google, you’ll have something a lot more substantial than just speculation. Or will you? *The Verge* reached out for comment and got an awfully convenient response.

> This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as ‘speculative design’ to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate.  

Wow! Leave it up to grand ole Googe to reveal the ultimate excuse for just about any suggestion or behavior, though it does seem almost *deliberately* uncomfortable, doesn’t it? No matter — whether or not this video was ever about a project or tangible product development, or simply to *explore uncomfortable ideas* because it is proof that the company has reached that critical Vatican stage — if you’ll remember — where they now feel comfortable *exploring* Very Bad, but Very easily made Real Ideas amongst themselves about what would happen if they allowed their system to *nudge its users* around a different, slightly less optimal route to the bar, let’s say — without their knowledge — in order for the system to collect traffic data for the sake of its own interests? Which would be, technically, in the interest of all Ledger users now and in the future, so why not?

> The ledger could be given a focus, shifting it from a system which not only tracks our behavior, but offers direction towards a desired result.”  

This, my dear privacy-obsessed friends, is the *real issue* with data collection — its power over huge groups by way of their behavior and it is *never* going to be remedied in any significant way by ad-blockers or VPNs because the EndUser shall always out number you 50 to 1, even decades from now. EndUser does not understand — or, crucially, *have any desire* to understand anything technical about what leads to the PewDiePie videos playing on his filthy screen. Here’s a great opportunity to escape Silicon Valley’s technolibertarianism and resign your Darwinian empathy in favor of meaningful and truly-effective action: if you want to avoid a future Google Church (or Google Government, more worryingly,) you should invest your time, effort, and knowledge into electing officials more capable of understanding and regulating Big Tech.

## Google Government

The internet as it stands is made possible by Google as *the* goto resource for online advertising. In 2016, “Google held 75.8 percent of the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search ads,” [according to ](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth)[*Recode*](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth). By 2019, “that’s expected to grow to $36.62 billion in revenue, or 80.2 percent of the market.” Google’s edge in user behavior and targeted advertising combined with their extensive resources available developers to integrate independent platforms with Google’s software services at various levels makes it very difficult for any advertising-funded individual or organization to compete online without dipping in to the Google universe. YouTube — a Google property since 2006 — has actively invested in and supported a new career path entirely within their own platform that is rapidly becoming [popularly aspired-to by young children](https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/19/children-now-more-likely-to-want-to-become-youtubers-than-actors-7241396/), while the reality of existence as a full-time YouTuber is [far less glamorous](https://medium.com/@robertoblake/what-nobody-tells-you-about-being-a-youtuber-the-youtube-middle-class-378b77eb8bc9) than the immediately-visible surface would indicate, and the effort already expended by my generation in its pursuit has already [made us insane](http://bit.ly/searchchildren).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-link-color="#00006b"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">thanks google. <a href="https://t.co/1jRtrD77R3">pic.twitter.com/1jRtrD77R3</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/914767928456749056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, what would the internet look like if Google didn’t exist? We know they’ve been working with the government now on various projects, but what if some terrible exposed transgression of theirs suddenly warranted an immediate shutdown and seizure of all Google properties? Well, we know from [a post on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-Google-were-to-shut-down-for-30-minutes) by Googler Ashish Kedia that even 5 years ago, the sudden absence of Google for “2–3 mins” set the internet into a bit of a panic, reducing overall traffic by 40%. In the time since, we’ve all grown exponentially more dependent on Google properties: billions of people rely on Google Maps for directions and, thousands of companies (including the Pentagon and other government institutions) rely on Gmail and GSuites for intercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc., and more and more academic institutions rely on Chromebook devices running connection-dependent operating systems. It’s not much of a stretch to argue that Google’s sudden disappearance would constitute a Civil Emergency in the United States, which will only become a stronger and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look the other way.

Though the tangible results of advertising have been quantified significantly in the past 20 years, one can’t help but wonder after watching YouTube ads for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class on toy unboxing videos if the companies who spend big bucks on Google advertising understand where their money is going, but they know that if they *don’t* advertise there, their competitors will. This, of course, is a fundamental practice of a monopoly, and it’s yielded Google so much fucking money that they cannot possibly spend it fast enough, as evidenced by [their investments in life extension](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/27/15409672/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research) — so that, perhaps, they will have more time on Earth to figure it out.

When you build a collection of the world’s smartest people in a [self-sufficient environment](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work) that discourages exploration of other lifestyles and ideas, and you sustain the society with a gargantuan, relatively low-maintenance revenue stream, you create a culture which is not only well-primed for isolationism, but is also extremely inefficient. In fact, with its [vast collection of abandoned products and properties](https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/it-vendors/google-graveyard-3508070/), Google must surely be one of the most inefficient companies in history. Thinking back on recent software releases along with its [recent entries into the hardware space](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16405184/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal), Google is also one of the worst competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or garnered significant usership. Google Play Music is unintuitive and impossible, Google Allo and Google+ are all but forgotten addendums to other services, and Google Search — its core, original function — has been [out of control](https://theoutline.com/post/1430/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem) for years, and all of them are designed blandly and excruciatingly tiring to look at.

## Google Shun

If this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to eliminate Google from your own online life as much as possible, there *are* alternatives in almost every one of the sphere’s they dominate. As of late, [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/about) has accumulated a fair amount of [buzz and coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/19/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo) as a private, more relevant alternative to Google’s plain old search engine. Though it is clever enough to list us as the first result for “extratone,” I’ve found it simply insufficient as a replacement in my own life because, essentially, it rarely delivers what I’m looking for. By contrast, [Dropbox Paper](http://dropbox.com/paper) is such an elegant cloud notetaking and word processing software that it makes Google Docs look simply idiotic (and warrants its own review very shortly.) For getting around, know that [MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.com) is not only [still around](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/does-mapquest-still-exist-as-a-matter-of-fact-it-does/2015/05/22/995d2532-fa5d-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html) — it’s now a very competitive mobile navigation app.

I, myself, have allowed Google as complete of access to my information and behavior as possible because I believe “privacy” is a completely futile endeavor if one wishes to be a part of society, though I do often use alternatives to Google services simply because I *fucking hate* the way they look. If you want a more complete list of services and software that allow one to shun the Google God entirely, you’ll be forced to seek out less dignified sources like [*Lifehacker*](https://lifehacker.com/5876794/going-google-free-the-best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/antigoogle/) and decide if the additional time you’ll spend using most of them to accomplish the same tasks is really worth your digital angst.

If Google were to be more explicit with its users and staff about its aspirations to take over control of our lives, there will be little to do but accept the future they intend to create because they’ve long been too powerful to control. In the meantime, I’d suggest you continue to use whatever software works best for you and refrain from wasting your time fretting on conspiratorial suppositions of what the tech industry may be doing to “invade your privacy,” because there is no longer any such thing, nor will there be ever again. However, I would also urge to you worship your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never be worthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun.

# Bandcamp: Streaming's Secret Savior

![Bandcamp Logo Banner](https://i.snap.as/toF3UAy.jpg)

## As the industry endeavors once again to reconcile the cultural and financial incentives of streaming digital music, one independent platform has wavered little from its 10-year-long mission to bring the business to the unsigned artist with elegance and integrity.

If you’ve ever thought to yourself *wow, Bandcamp has looked basically the same forever*, you were entirely correct – now for a tenth of the century, at least – and you’ll be hard-pressed to find another Silicon Valley technology company toting a venture-funded origin story with such casual, yet robust long-standing user relationships underneath an unwavering, bullshit-free commitment to their product. Even under the most ludicrous scrutiny, the company’s rudder is flawless and its course true. What at first glance you’d swear to be an unsolicited conclusion to an obscure examination could very reasonably be described as *cheesy*, *stubborn*, *dweebish*, *pious*, or just generally *boring*, indeed, yet the respective accuracy of each of these adjectives are no more than the byproducts of the very same operational ethics which we’ve suggested, requested, demanded, and begged the rest of the world’s computing capitol to re-adopt, enforce, or at least *ponder* for a beat. The volume of the masses’ exponentially-increasing attendance of late is only overcome by its hysterical shouting match, so let us pipe down for a while, now so that we may be precise as we dig deeper into the methodology which has finally led to a profitable, drama-free outlying technology organization without the need for a single drop of analogous sweat over its brand upkeep. By arranging the company in its infancy to so precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers, the original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting simplicity in the single overarching priority for those in every single role behind the quiet perpetuation of Bandcamp dot com: **selling good** **music**. 

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2Fdavod%2F%D1%82%D0%BD%CE%B1%D0%B8kf%CF%85l-f%CF%83%D1%8F-b%CE%B1%D0%B8dc%CE%B1%D0%BC%CF%81-2018-%D0%BCix%2F" frameborder="0" ></iframe>

The platform indiscriminately provides both individual artists and labels with a clean, cozy, charming, smartly-designed and technically competent storefront with a wide-open storage allocation, optimal search engine optimization and a widely-trusted point of sale experience in exchange for 15% of any sales that should come in – [significantly less](https://medium.com/@gloom303/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on-spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930) than other channels; *half* what Apple Music will take. In examining Bandcamp’s history, its impact on independent music, and its viability as an alternative streaming service, we shall excavate the truth behind the derisive cynicism directed its way by the titans of the tech and music press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9-4H-MXmiLQ?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

To catch our starting gun, we must first travel to *Face The Music 2016* in Melbourne – as far as one can possibly get from The Valley – alongside Bandcamp’s super-worldly Chief Curator, [Andrew Jervis](https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis) to observe his interview for a live audience.

> Bandcamp has always grown extremely organically. There’s never actually been any advertising that we’ve done; there’s never any advertising on the site, and there never will be. We haven’t really tooted our horn very hard.

In fact, just about everything from the shrewd idealism of those who beget its conception to the on-the-nose care in their person-to-person customer service is so adamantly inverse of the tech industry archetype which the global End User community at large are presently discovering at twice the speed of sound there should *at least* be some conspiratorializing going around. Where I come from, launching a desolate business to little mainstream success with persistence and dignified determination is (or should be) regarded as a telltale sign that one is running a front (according to the television, anyway,) but exploration of this plausibility yielded nothing in Bandcamp’s case, even after I took the risk of incrimination and begged a certain Boston-based future funk producer to accept my ginormous bribe and include *any* sort of pharmacological substance with his summer beat tape. He wouldn’t even send antihistamines.

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MaUkS-lr-ZM?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As uncomfortably as it lands on the soul, no moniker describes Bandcamp more comprehensively than “an online record store.” As far as [Ethans](https://youtu.be/inzhStQJFQw) go, Bandcamp’s CEO and founders’ public attaché Ethan Diamond is as good as they come: it’s quite telling that he is the only Silicon Valley CEO who’s remained intellectually grounded enough with the rest of us in order to retain any skills in nuanced forms of verbal communication like… humor. The closest the company has ever come to promotion? His awkward, sub-20-minute [presentation](https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM) at the XOXO Festival 2014 offered an impressively succinct introduction to their greater mission considering the unmistakable agony in his body language. 

“We worked out of the public library for the first four years of the company's existence,” he admits. Impressively, Bandcamp was operated entirely as a “virtual company” until 2015.

Either Bandcamp just happens to be the single Silicon Valley company where the executives are unanimously so fucking fulfilled by their work without exception that they aren’t compelled to leave it long enough to stumble upon the inevitable coastal colleague with a connection to something like The Internet History Podcast, or technology journalism has definitively lost all reverence for actual innovation in favor of the [emotionally-charged](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/ideas-emotions-innovation-riding-amazement-cycle.aspx) Innovation Myth, now [relinquished almost entirely](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17610348/twitter-elon-musk-display-name-change-lock-account-crypto-scams) to the narrative control of its own protagonists. Perhaps it was inevitable that Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos would become immortalized as “those who make things happen,” but our ability to quantify value as consumers tends to scurry rapidly away behind our backs when they’re turned by the constant distraction of these mostly inert figureheads. As their personalities have stolen the story, the people in industry with their hands on real product have all but completely disappeared from the frame, and all of the work remaining at the End User’s eye level was abandoned by aspiration long ago and replaced with the unfulfilling mechanism of A Quick Buck. Though now we are proceeding into a similar frame – only because our subject cares more about their mission than claiming recognition for it and might just be the first such company run by a cast who become sincerely defensive at the suggestion of a cash-out.

“Bandcamp’s philosophy has always been very different [from] a lot of the companies we’re surrounded by,” reflects Jervis. “We are not a ‘let’s-raise-money-and-burn-through-it’ type of company.”

I know that your mind has been trained by years of engagement with the digital media of a rapidly-globalizing, venture capital-obsessed society to block the passage of this sort of language across your conscious threshold at risk of life-threatening overexposure to the Medium Dialect and its churnalising neoliberal cyberchode scholars of the Personal Brand; I know you’ve read the exact same quote from how many entrepreneurs in how many worthless, masturbatory business magazine profiles, but I swear on my one-of-a-kind Estonian Hilary Duff pullout that Jervis speaks without irony or deception. how many fucking churnicles have abandoned you, but this time, it’s actually sincere.

# On The Web

Though Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive library-modeled music streaming service in existence, the topical conversations between both technology and music journalists and industry executives flooding both podcast and news feeds at the moment orbiting the “Cord-Cutting” phenomena as it’s washed over television, cinema, and music are rooted in the same building blocks as the core technology behind the delivery of all of these conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough. As long as my subgeneration has known it, The Web has been a source of sound in some manifestation, but the example with the most perplexing history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main menu of my iPhone’s native music app contains the text “Radio” beneath an “antenna with waves” graphic which opens a service once called [iTunes Radio](https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/) that was absorbed into – and [restricted to subscribers of](https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10777790/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28) – Apple Music as of 2016, confusingly. However, both “iTunes Radio” and “Apple Music Radio(?)” – along with any and all audio streaming services (mentioned and not) – are fundamentally nothing more than different UX design interpretations of the “simple” practice of streaming an audio file, which made its debut at the turn of the century in the form of “Internet Radio.” Astonishingly, the protocol – still referred to by at least one person on Earth as “Webcasting,” no doubt – has survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have likely encountered it in unusual situations. 

Ironically, the [majority](http://radio.garden/) of Internet Radio broadcasts remaining on the air are nothing more than live duplicates of the traditional radio wave-bound products from the physical stations your car’s head unit receives. Even the current desktop version of iTunes maintains support for streaming “audio files over the internet,” though a glance at [Apple’s dated support page](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19478?locale=en_US) for the process suggests it hasn’t crossed anybody’s mind for at least half of that history. In 1994, the publicly-funded radio network Voice of America became the “[First [radio] on the Internet](http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html)” when it [began](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/rec.radio.shortwave/2pQ9KUYmLqo/wqhhXS2k-lAJ) – after an introduction by Al Gore, no less – “offering digitized audio versions of selected newscasts and other program segments in 15 languages on its public internet server on Monday, Aug. 15,” according to former engineer Chris Kern. However – since we’re already this deep into internet history – a distinction must be established between streaming static files and streaming live audio. The first relies on pre-recorded audio files uploaded to a publicly-accessible server – in Kern’s original case, “via anonymous FTP and the Internet Gopher protocol,” which continues to be the elemental process behind every audio file streamed across the Web (including those on Bandcamp, Apple Music, Spotify, etc.) more or less because it ain’t broke. 

Semantically, “live” digital audio streaming in its aforementioned “purest” form is more or less exclusive to Internet Radio. Obscured aside from the traditional station simulcast, Web-only Internet Radio stations have their own of “[the Internet’s quiet success stories](https://www.thestar.com/business/2007/04/09/web_radio_may_stream_north_to_canada.html),” filled with quaint experiences and an endless cycle of death proclamations which continue to be disproven, anywise.

On June 27th, 1999, *The Seattle Times* ran [an especially worthwhile introduction to the concept](http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990627&slug=2968794) that likely represents the only major newspaper’s mention of SHOUTcast (the first and likely last name in DIY Web DJing) in the history of the printed word within a work of truly phenomenal tech reporting on Mark Mataassa’s part. From the past, one will find his chillingly spot-on foresight and well-considered observations are bestrewed with mind-boggling hilarity when they look.

> Dialing in to the Net through a 56 kilobit-per-second modem, as I am, this seems like a ridiculous waste - or at least misallocation - of resources.
>
> I'm using a $3,000 machine, tying up a phone line and seriously compromising my computing power for an experience that in sound quality, simplicity and dependability can't compare, truthfully, with the $9 Emerson clock radio an arm's length away.

> And yet Web radio is one of the hottest ideas going in the ever-hot world of Internet startups and acquisitions: In the past few months, America Online and Yahoo! each have purchased fast-growing Web music sites, rock-music trendsetters like Rolling Stone and MTV have gotten into the business, and technological improvements - from Microsoft's newest browser and Real Networks' newest player to the latest MP3 enhancements - are closing the quality and accessibility gaps.
>
> The combination of developments is not only changing how computers (and radios) are used, but offering a glimpse of a future when audience demographics are sliced ultra-thin - to the person - and everybody has the potential to be a radio broadcaster as well as listener.

I only have a few experiences with Internet Radio of my own, but they’re all rampantly more memorable than one would expect. The now in-stasis [NWIRE](https://twitter.com/nwireradio) project was by the most relevantly intriguing and [savvily-curated](https://soundcloud.com/themartmusic/nwire-radio-guest-mix-11-feb-2017) home for a diverse host of electronic musicians I’ve ever come across – it was my second default browser tab for most of 2017, when I’d even listen to the odd-hour broadcasts overseen by just the automated library-perusing bot for hours. On [episode 16 of *Drycast*](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc/a-a4674c), I recounted [the absurd tale](https://clyp.it/mps4yfyv) of my surprise morning encounter with a Norwegian station’s live broadcast from some European breakcore club, which was likely responsible for the most fun I’ve ever had working in retail.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=374449027/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1571966121/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://ultrademon.bandcamp.com/album/seapunk">Seapunk by Ultrademon</a></iframe>

*Extratone*’s former Tech Editor is partial to a station called [Radio Swiss Jazz](http://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en), which appears to be thriving in comparison with most visible broadcasters, and unapologetically emits a bizarre amalgamation of tunes both chart-topping and Seriously Obscure across every conceivable genre (including Marching Music,) and continent of origin. Between every few charts, the brief commentary and station identification has provided our own private mystery: Was that one pre-recorded? This guy was on yesterday, but has since shed his accent? However, these tiny temporary mysteries are Internet Radio’s only remaining value for us, and I suspect the same is true for all but the most laggard laggards. For as long as I’ve been coherent enough to disseminate between much of anything, very few of its visible offerings have offered anything groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence (one can very easily arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle through a given library of music and/or podcasts indefinitely,) frustration, or economic necessity.

Crucially, the truly *most* critical consequences and contributions provided by the pioneers of Internet Radio to our current digital streaming experience were centered within intellectual property legislation and advertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this juncture marks our complete departure from my wheelhouse, but thankfully, a few sacred accounts of one of technology’s foremost confusing clashes with the ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of the American justice system do indeed remain. As early as 2002, the ineffable Doc Searls reported on a document authored by the Library of Congress’ Copyright Royalty Board called “[Determination of Royalty Rates and Terms for Ephemeral Recording and Webcasting Digital Performance of Sound Recordings](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/02/2016-09707/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance)” for *Linux Journal* in an encyclopedic breakdown of its implications ironically entitled “[Why Are So Many Internet Radio Stations Still on the Air](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6218)?” I would hope my comprehension is sufficient to declare that *this was no Cambridge Analytica*: only a few years subsequent the technology’s inception, operators within the Internet Radio business faced serious and immediate fines for their pre-enforcement distribution of copyrighted material stretching *four years* back – the severity of which the Doc suggested would “surely bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters that have been pioneering this marketplace for the longest time.”

> Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the old-fashioned airwaves, Internet radio stations' primary market relationship isn't with advertisers; it's with listeners. In many cases, the listeners are the primary source of revenue. This business model is similar to that of noncommercial (public) radio, only the market relationship is much more direct and efficient. Internet radio stations don't need to stop programming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to call phone volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a t-shirt. Listeners simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link, and after a few more clicks they've made a payment.

By [March, 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20100330102643/http:/directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Sound_Files/MP3/Streaming/Stations), just 374 stations were aggregated in Google’s Internet Radio Directory, and my own quick sample from its list unfortunately indicated that most are now silent, but SHOUTcast has yet to be abandoned after all this time and we can safely suppose the core architecture of the internet will remain recognizable enough to support it until after we’re all dead, rendering the necessary tools indefinitely ready and accessible should new projects in NWIRE’s vein come along (I know of no better fate I could wish upon the protocol.) From Internet Radio’s pioneer days, we must skip over a whole era to close in on Bandcamp’s origin in the very brightest peak of Web 2.0.

Again, we find ourselves in 2008 and nobody knows what an iPhone is, but the same classic rock-worshiping, upper-middle class, white collar Early Majority who first loved Internet Radio are now rapidly and delightedly distributing links to something called “Pandora dot com” between AOL and Hotmail inboxes. True luxury music reproduction comes in the form of Beats headphones motivated by a 320GB iPod Classic. Budding audiophiles and backpacker dweebs illegally torrent lossless .FLACs to play over their Christmas-gifted studio monitors with WinAmp, which they’ve set up to impeccably “scrobble” their history with every played track to their Last.fm profiles. Everybody else is still buying music from iTunes. (Those who cannot afford to buy the music they intend to add to their libraries transition to the music nerd classification as soon as they’ve sought out a way to obtain it free.) “Streaming” comes from subscription services like Rhapsody (now Napster,) which are [too buried in Digital Rights Management controversy](http://www.alphr.com/features/218559/the-online-music-rip-off) to feel sustainable. MySpace Music has just begun to fade away – next year, in “the Twitter era,” [SoundCloud will definitively replace it](https://www.wired.com/2009/07/soundcloud-threatens-myspace-as-music-destination-for-twitter-era/) as the go-to creator network – and Pandora’s immediate future is bright – they’ll make a big move on brand-new mobile streaming experience when they [launch their iPhone OS app](https://www.cnet.com/news/photos-hands-on-with-pandoras-internet-radio-iphone-app/) in July, but the limited performance of the handset’s EDGE network will render it a poor alternative to onsite .mp3s for years to come.

In January, to minimal acclaim, Oddpost’s Ethan Diamond launched Bandcamp, the startup with programmer friends Joe Holt, Shawn Grunberger, and Neal Tucker to be “a sortof WordPress for musicians” – an easily-created, well-designed landing page to showcase one’s digital music files. As Holt laments in [an interview with ](http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php)*The HTML Times*, creating an online presence for your music had long been “a pain in the ass.” 

“You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for musicians so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy.”

As an address to all of their shared complaints about the experience of online music distribution up to that point, [early Bandcamp](https://web.archive.org/web/20090716104620/http:/bandcamp.com) was an astounding piece of engineering. The quaint, unsurprisingly crate-digger-looking Ethan Diamond – who’s more or less remained the singular public face of the company since the very beginning – began a brand tradition of transparently music-nerdy correspondence with his [first post on the Bandcamp blog](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/), explaining the solutions the team had come up with in greater detail.

> We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.

The launch garnered very little attention from tech or music publications of the time, but [Andy Baio’s interview with Diamond](https://waxy.org/2008/09/bandcamp_launch/) provides a substantial, technically in-depth picture of just how revolutionary and necessary it was. Most of what has continued to make Bandcamp such an essential tool was present at the very beginning: server-side stats and metadata (a unique architectural undertaking, no doubt,) track and album-oriented pagination, and a robust, easily-embedded Flash player.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1739268?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:auto;height:auto;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Study [Diamond’s first “screencast”](https://vimeo.com/1739268) alongside a [video tour of SoundCloud](https://vimeo.com/1857085) from the period and you’ll notice just how much more functional, future-proofed and *dignified* Bandcamp appeared in comparison. As apprehensive as I am to be caught arguing for minimalism over good design, it’s made perfect sense in the use case of *this one platform*, which knew *exactly* what it was from birth, along with what it would *always* be, apparently, which is such a bizarre reversal of the archetypes and the relentless common narrative we know from The Valley’s legends. Ethan first shows the consumer’s experience – none of which has changed after a whole decade aside from quality-specific track purchases – before delving into the artist-side UI, beginning with the statistics tool, which included playback and search insights to a depth that was (and still is) unheard of from a free service. Then, he demonstrates the publishing process from upload to playback: adding album art, setting a release date, and pricing its purchase. Aside from their removal of the old waveform visualizer (I couldn’t find any record of an announcement of this decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp has changed absolutely *nothing* of what’s shown in Diamond’s tutorial. In the next few months, they would add [custom page design](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/11/26/design-customization/), [email address capture](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/12/22/free-download-email-capture-thingy/), and [support for custom domains](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2009/01/23/custom-domains-custom-domains/). By October 2008, they’d made enough waves to be [picked up by ](https://www.cnet.com/news/bandcamp-for-cleaner-music-sites/)*CNET*, for whatever that was worth. Apparently, [Facebook Music](https://venturebeat.com/2008/10/22/facebook-music-is-getting-its-act-together/) was a legitimate property as well, but I do not remember anything about it at all—pondering an alternate reality in which *The* Social Network became the dominant online music streaming platform leads to a bizarre comparison of Neil Diamond and Mark Zuckerberg which I can’t imagine being altogether productive. Suffice it to say, the two founders’ visions differ greatly.

# Musicblogocide

Contextually, it’s also important that we dwell for a moment on the legal and financial hullabaloo surrounding music sales during Bandcamp’s first formative years, and the federal government’s losing battle to interpret, enforce, or replace intellectual property law for the information age. As the Web had grown exponentially more capable and accessible as a means of audio file distribution, it had become absolutely saturated with blatantly DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs. For years, the quickest way to follow up on a *check it out* sort of music recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name followed by “.mp3.” If the first go didn’t yield success, even the most rudimentary application of cryptography – like substituting some variation of “nsilmtic.rar” to find a download for Nas’ *Illmatic*, for instance – was a sure bet for one’s second try, which would often return several copies just laying around Google-indexed WordPress media libraries, though results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable alternative. This was the establishment into which my first adolescent digital music discoveries were borned, and I’m still convinced that 99% of us participants were completely without malice. I’d argue heartily that music’s brief escape from the tireless grip of the record industry as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be clearly shown to have a net gain for the whole of American recording artists if you could measure and plot it, including the past, present, and future use of peer-to-peer sharing.

2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of DRM-violating traffic on the *visible* Web, at least. Though it’d be virtually impossible to quantify, is it only reasonable to assume that many siteowners made some real money from the ad impressions that directly resulted from their unauthorized hosting and Mediafire-embedding, but let’s consider how minuscule even the most outrageously liberal overestimate would be, side-by-side with the billions in additional revenue YouTube has raked in from the same music since assuming their place as the de facto platform for quickly summoning just about any work of audio that’s ever taken digital form. It was in February of that year that Blogger (another Google property) [deleted six music blogs](https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html) from its platform in response to complaints about allegedly DMCA-violating .mp3s. *The Registry* [insisted](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/11/google_musicblogocide_2010/) the collective finger be pointed at the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, itself. 

“It would seem the music bloggers aren't versed in the ways of DMCA claims and counterclaims. But you can't blame Google for that,” they concluded, after one of the blog’s founders expressed some of the most personally-dramatic words mine empathy has yet faced as [quoted in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/11/google-deletes-music-blogs).

“It's just sad because we were documenting young people's music from all around the globe. For a lot of people, it was music they wouldn't have been able to discover elsewhere.”

In hindsight, “blame” is an even more useless avenue of one’s attention than usual, especially when one party (Google) was 100% exempt from any consequences all along. The alarming takeaway is not the DMCA’s deftness, but that **Google had the freedom to wait for a parallel business incentive before deciding the law applied to them**.

Frankly, we should all have realized long ago just how fucking futile it is to attempt to control any file traffic. Every desktop-class browser ships with the capability to capture any streamable media on the Web with a handful of keystrokes – it’d take a maximum of 20 minutes to bestow upon even the most casual user the knowledge they’d need to keep every single track, YouTube video, and Twitch stream they’d ever watch, 100% legally without a single third-party service/extension interaction, but the crucial question remains to what end, exactly? It’s easy, but it’s not exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two rationales that’d justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1) the totally bonkers inclination that any given property/ies is likely to disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the increasingly rarefying expectation of prolonged time away from internet access. 

As Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music streaming sphere has expanded titanically around it as if enveloping the Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the eye of a ruinous tech industry cyclone, which would explosively expand the market into a ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyond anything we’d recognize from the rule of the WinAmp Hipster, long ago. **Today, the coolest and most rabid daily music listeners I know all have Spotify memberships**, joining [70 million others](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users) globally as of January. For most, it’s how they prefer to swaddle their lives in a constant soundtrack – at work, in the car, at school, then at home on the television. For many, it’s how they “explore” new music outside of peer and social recommendations... or, that’s how the narrative was supposed to go, anyway. Those folks I know who actually create music, however, are rarely seen using Spotify—even after they’ve endured untold horrors in order to publish their own music there—because the real story of its track record as a place to “Discover” new artists, genres, or sounds is completely abysmal. When 2017’s streaming data began coming in this past January, a popular feature by [Galaxie 500](http://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/)’s Damon Krukowski was run by the definitively terminal music magazine of broad notoriety—*Pitchfork*—entitled “[How to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming](https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/),” which he began by citing some very alarming statistics.

“**More than 99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent most-streamed tracks** [on Spotify.] Which means less than 1 percent of streams account for all other music.” 

Why? A brazen disregard for necessary meta information, for one.

“Look now at how badly their applications already serve entire genres of less popular music. Spotify lists recordings by song title, album title, or featured artist name. But that information is so limited it leaves out even the other performers on a recording, a crucial aspect to classical and jazz.”

![Spotify-Pitfork](https://i.snap.as/96z3H8C.png)

Alarming for those of us who intend to create or consume any music separate the Top 40, anyway, which one should feel justified expecting from most people, most of the time. Last month, The Carters released an album on which [even Beyoncé](https://www.bustle.com/p/when-will-everything-is-love-be-on-spotify-beyonce-jay-z-fans-may-have-to-wait-to-stream-the-surprise-album-update-9426616) identified the problematic service by name. “Patiently waiting for my demise ‘cause my success can’t be quantified,” she rapped, “if I gave two fucks about streaming numbers woulda put Lemonade up on Spotify." The unfortunate issue with this single denouncement of the industry’s current direction is that its source is adamantly guaranteed a place for her work within Spotify’s top 10 percent for the rest of her career’s lifetime (and probably far beyond.)

[I could now take the time to complain that she’s also entirely abandoned the city [she owes for her career’s creation](https://youtu.be/iiMlq8frlqw) in its darkest hour, but let’s just plan on coming back to the subject at a later date, when we’ll be sure to touch on how terribly Drake also treats Houston (and women.)]

Unsurprisingly, the apathy is far from mutual. From the Swedish company’s perspective, the digits themselves should’ve been dearly and universally beloved from the beginning, and their exponentially ballooning hubris became so inflated by 2014 that they [launched a WordPress blog](https://insights.spotify.com/us/about-spotify-insights/) dedicated entirely to promoting and discussing their data called [*Spotify Insights*](https://insights.spotify.com/), proclaiming themselves—naturally—to be “the world’s favorite streaming service,” [championing](https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/11/02/listening-diversity-spotify/) the growing diversity in their demographics. Though Beyoncé is mentioned only twice upon a [search of its archive](https://insights.spotify.com/us/?s=beyonce) as it stands today, it’s with fanfare: “[10 Female Artists Women Listen To The Most on Spotify](https://insights.spotify.com/us/2015/03/06/10-female-artists-women-listen-to-the-most/)” declared her the third most popular female artist among women, globally, and “Single Ladies” the number one female-streamed track in the world (assuming I’m interpreting its language correctly.)

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3826527505/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1880328200/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://pressurerecords.bandcamp.com/album/k-o">K.O. by Miss Red</a></iframe>

We’ve established that Spotify has comfortably planted itself at the polar opposite end of the business spectrum from Bandcamp, yet for the sake of an oblivious adjudicating layman’s understanding, you’d have your work cut out for you explaining the difference between them: both are online marketplaces with gigantic libraries of digital music which a listener can browse, download locally, or stream from using Web browser or the mobile applications offered by each, respectively—and they can do from just about anywhere, for as much or as little as they wish. And—as the music industry and its satellites shall always remain for the rest of humanity’s reign—both are overwhelmingly associated with young people. There, the crucial divide should probably ring a bell—it’s been a constant between cultural generations for as long as culture, itself has existed.

There are those among us who’s adolescent adoration of music is still completely valid as a very powerful component of hormonal development, yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or worse by the time our post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And then, there are those on whom the curiosity clings devotedly on: the cool high school punk band-forming types our culture loves to romanticize, who’ll inevitably end up bald and bespeckled with a pre-dawn community radio block. These Musicians, Crate-Diggers, and capital-A Audiophiles have historically overlapped in synonymous functions across a love triangle of dweebish intolerability, though it’s become especially easy as of late to forget that DIY recording is by no means a recent development—its financial and technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummeted thanks to the developmental progression of Digital Audio Workstations and a growing industry of consumer-oriented audio equipment. For succinct insight into this dynamic, let’s refer to the pre-dialogue context in [Chuck Klosterman’s *GQ* interview](https://www.gq.com/story/jimmy-page-led-zeppelin-men-of-the-year-klosterman) with “the second- or the third-best rock guitarist of all time”—*Zinc Blimp* legend Jumbo Page.

> The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of the music, and how that sound was achieved. He can talk about microphone placement for a very, very long time. Are you interested in having a detailed conversation about how the glue used with magnetic audiotape was altered in the late 1970s, subsequently leading to the disintegration of countless master tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If a different musician obsessed over technological details with this level of exacting specificity, he would likely be classified as a “nerd," as that has become a strange kind of compliment in the Internet age. People actually want to be seen as nerds. But that designation does not apply here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotely nerdy.

Bandcamp’s core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to handle the “hard part” for creators “so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy,” which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the best metadata management utility for all time, but also committing to a traditional interpretation of music mediums that can feel old fashioned in 2018. Despite having been around for a directly comparable length of time, SoundCloud has maintained its relevance among friends in my network as the more socially-focused platform for keeping up with work from their peers thanks in large part to its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment function, which allows for ultra-specific shortform feedback between fellow creators and fans. This is how the company has chosen to grow its community, which has lent especially to its strength in the most “nerdy” independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience is busy by design and the divide between listener and creator is next to non-existent—by now, the difference is universally irrelevant. External sharing has also become a major strength since the inception of SoundCloud’s Web audio player, which was unlike any other embeddable we’d ever seen at the time. Over the years, it’s become the most universally-supported means of embedding a track or playlist elsewhere, though the space has quite recently began blooming with a few much slimmer Open Web offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio.

While I can casually throw these names around for you in the same sized font, the gulfs between the properties they denote are completely inexpressible in words. Because Spotify went public in Q1 of this year, they released [their first earnings report](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006667/en/) in April: 170 million active monthly users, $1.33 billion in total quarterly revenue, and $5.7-$6.2 billion in expected total revenue for 2018. I’ll spare you the entire Forbes piece it would require to comprehensively demonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity canyon the industry represents. Early projects like Pandora were docile, ad-free, and sincerely curious about the curatorial potential of music streaming services – *let’s use this cool new tech to play **music** for **anybody** with a Web browser if only because it’ll be a blast* – yet in that sense, they’ve all failed entirely. All except Bandcamp, anyway.

“We started as a service to help artists sell their music and merchandise directly to their fans, but then as the site grew—it’s now at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums [as of 2014]—we evolved into also being a destination for music Discovery,” he explains, partially anticipating the foot-to-the-floor transition to streaming which has indeed shook the industry the hell up over the years since. The company's solution is minimal, elemental, yet uniquely alternative as only theirs could be: an idealized **digital interpretation of a music collection**, which had actually launched a year before XOXO as part of “[Bandcamp for Fans](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/).” That release notably introduced the ability to “follow” both artist and fan accounts, the now-iconic “supported-by” section on release pages showing customers’ avatars and optional comments, and public wishlists. “I think it’s great to use a streaming service for music Discovery—they can be really really good for that,” Diamond [concedes](https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s), before reiterating one of the several variations of Bandcamp’s founding premise that composes his core argument: “if you actually care about music, and you care about the people who make it, and you want them to keep making it, the best way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to use services that allow you to directly support them.”

Instead of the “firehose”-like experience of a contemporary activity feed, “you’ve got a collection of albums and tracks that people were passionate enough to spend money on.” For my personal use, Ethan lit up a long-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My use of Bandcamp had long been to purchase and download music files, only—never to stream it—and there’s been good reason for this. While Bandcamp has formally supported playback on iPhone and iPad in-browser since [July 2010](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/), actually using it for any substantial amount of playback has always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it’s persisted *to this day*, we must concede that it is part of an intentional design rather than just an irritating flaw: **multitasking between apps or even browser tabs will prevent continuous playback of an album**, as will locking the device. In order to move from track to track fluidly, one must keep the page with the in-use Bandcamp player front and center. For three years, this was the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile, but such capability was far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then—3G data networks were worse than you remember, anyway—and then in 2013, [the Bandcamp app was launched](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/) on iOS and Android, providing a sufficient fix in my book at the time. (I’d rather any externally-embedded players I may engage with in an album review or artist profile be limited to a single track, anyway.) However, the app itself remained quite mediocre for years, which was a tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their desktop experience had been when the company launched,but not necessarily a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were attracting.

I made a point to spend *a lot* of time engaging with Bandcamp’s service as much as possible – naturally, this included a trip back through [my neglected, digitally dusty Collection](http://bandcamp.com/davidblue), which proved a way more emotionally provocative experience than I anticipated. Ethan’s simple truth didn’t really sink in until I realized that this list is made up exclusively of my *real favorites*, and there’s not a single track that is not inextricably and intoxicatingly tied to a specific era(s) of my life (yes, even that one Blank Banshee album... I was 18, okay?) It’s absurdly powerful—not something I could engage with for any extended time without becoming saturated with nostalgic gut stuff. (Listen for my upcoming special celebratory episode of [Extratone Radio](http://extratone.com/radio) to hear the best music I’ve found through Bandcamp.) It hadn’t occurred to me that I would retain ownership and streaming rights to all music I’ve purchased—including for a $0.00 sum, as I did for at least half of the works you see—even after an artist chose to delete or hide it on their own page. (Though they are not retained in my public collection, of course.)

# The Discovery Debacle

Pursuing an objective definition of “music Discovery” might appear foolish – an individual’s music taste is perhaps the most broadly angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern American culture, after all – but its the pungent poignancy of our fundamental human relationship with sound, itself which makes the history of Discovery’s digitization so important (and fascinating.) If I were to ask you what you believe should be the single most important function that must be reliably performed by any “music Discovery” device – whether it be an application, Web service, magazine or even a crate-digging habit – the single factor which would render whole vague concept inert, irrelevant, and/or completely destroyed, how would you answer? How would you interpret the question? 

It’s important we do well to take a considerable moment to cultivate a special wariness of the eggshells beneath our feet in this arena. Debatably at least a minim more than one’s taste in film, Americans from Generation X on forward until the end of time (I suspect) will hold “their” music as perhaps the most integral support upon which their identities are built throughout every stage of their lives. The intense sensation of ownership that propels this phenomenon within our culture leaves an especially sensitive passage ahead of us.

As a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored the idea of anti-music in my own entirely Bandcamp-supported project while I searched – aided tremendously by my expert best friend – for the edgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on which to publicly attach on my identity in an opposing of “Discovery’s” extremes with fandom: **an obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between the cultural reality and my delusional pubescent need to be unique**. This process appears to be a universal requisite in modern youth in one form or another, but it’s important now that I emphasize this confession: I was an especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I’ve continued to find my shame well worth achieving a specific balance for music’s purpose in my life, and I’d anecdotally endorse its potential to relieve cognitive dissonance at great scale. There’s only so much fun to be had blasting breakcore cassettes at deafening, distorted volumes solely to bewilder rural overnight convenience store clerks on their smoke breaks in the wee hours or the bruteforce seizure of the speakers’ Bluetooth connection at a frat party just to play harsh noise or anime-sampling Hardstyle while demonically shrieking – eyes rolled back – and lighting various parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1) it’s they who end up looking like the idiots for aggressively breaching a group’s fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how interesting, rare, or underrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by ferally manifesting, you’ve deligitimized yourself, which 3) can seriously damage any future attempts to accomplish **the fundamental drive to share the gospel of music’s variety** out of your own rubish frustration with the differences between you.

The real, sweetest truth is that **100% of all music has value potential** because of the medium’s broad influence on the human psyche. Pop music is amazing right now; the signature trap sound we devalued with Datpiff jokes made us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our “irony” and burrowed its own huge partition in our sincere hearts. After my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own rural roots by scoffing at country music for years, I’ve made a beautiful peace with the childhood memories and the historic excellence of Shania Twain and The Dixie Chicks in their mastery of both wholesome joy and crippling nostalgia (I’ve even cried to Taylor Swift.) Yes, it’s been entirely reasonable all along to enjoy the straightforwardly slothen pleasure in belching “Sweet Home Alabama” pounding cheap pissbeer on a foul pontoon boat on the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess that I’ve only found true and serene identity through music after learning how to stop insisting so violently upon the worldly, one-of-a-kind superiority of my “taste.”

That said, it’s still bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued justifications for our classic fainéance – actively choosing to subject our public ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is inherently halved – only to then have the audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. **I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture**, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.

Consider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys – generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER...” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party.

Suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing… How very charming. 

“*The 70s, the 80s… the one-hit wonder channel!”* 

Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so distasteful, but their *regularity*. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we’re *trying* to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or *both*. After failing my best attempts to elaborate with historical analogy citing a past event, I’m afraid we must pivot to a science fiction-esque nanonarrative containing obnoxiously speculative hypotheticals, instead.

**Imagine**: It’s 2036 – four years after we found out we are not alone in the universe when a significantly more advanced civilization makes formal first contact with humanity by sending a party of diplomats, anthropologists, and explorers (who were actually getting ready to go in 2016 before getting word of the Trump presidency and deciding we weren’t quite ready just yet) who land their space egg right in front of the United Nations’ New York City headquarters and expressing something to the tune of *hey so um… we noticed you guys moved in and we just wanted to stop by and say hi*, entirely altering humanity’s self-perception and future trajectory (see: works by Gene Roddenberry) yadda yadda. The visitors expressed a wish to begin a cultural exchange project with us, and it’s just now coming to fruition… I have only moments ago made history in the eyes of the entire world when I walked through the front door of a Target store in suburban New Jersey leading a hovering hyper-intelligent silicon-based sphere of agender mist (roughly comparative to a basketball in size,) who’s already both impressing and shaming me tremendously as we move by the in-store Starbucks. From above us, Semisonic’s “Closing Time” is belched upon my life’s proudest moment and my guest requests we pause to discuss it, to my profound horror.

“The sound from the reproduction devices embedded above us...” the android translator trails off for a moment. “It is the same noise that was distantly reproduced 51 hours ago in ‘Miami’ as I conversed with Ambassador Phillip Defranco about ‘the setting sun’ on the ‘beach,’ coming from a small open air structure which he defined as ‘a surf shop,’ which was occupied by a young male who appeared to be moderately agitated, moving about in jagged strides as he wildly smacked the foundational surface with ‘a broom.’ The Ambassador explained the youth was likely nearing the end of his allotted period of daily occupational labor.”

Blood is flooding my cheeks as I listen with a building dread to the robot’s interpretation, awash with all manner of embarrassment for my species. 

“Is the purpose of this noise reproduction of a logistical nature, or is it perhaps a common ritual within business and/or working class culture?”

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2309125545/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2334991176/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://ripswirl.bandcamp.com/album/possessed">Possessed by RIP Swirl</a></iframe>

Now, it’s your turn to be the human representative in this pico science fiction: you’re now obligated to confirm the alien anthropologist’s hypothesis and explain that “Closing Time” is but one piece of recorded music among billions of diverse expressive works across millennia. You must reverently describe how the “universal language” of math within melodious composition has long been a hefty buzzword in the pop culture conversations about interstellar communication and our longtime search for extraterrestrial intelligence from the future-thrilled 90s—S.E.T.I.’s glory days – when we felt pretty damned good about space. The historic launch of the United Nations’ “greetings on behalf of the people of our planet” etched into [The Golden Record](https://www.npr.org/2017/09/30/554489944/the-voyager-golden-record-finally-finds-an-earthly-audience) aboard *Voyager I* and Jodie Foster’s novel portrayal of a S.E.T.I. scientist in the iconic Carl Sagan-sourced 1997 science fiction drama *Contact* are among the globally-celebrated Best Hits of humanism (not to mention the organization listed on your paystubs,) and they weigh a billion tons on you, now—in the most significant moment of your entire life, bar none – as you explain on behalf of your species to **real** extraterrestrial intelligence the reality of how negligent it is actually is of the culture the Record claimed to treasure. The worst part, though? The entire experience is accompanied by a nasal-as-hell Semisonic soundtrack.

Aren’t you *frustrated*? You should be, but it’s not over yet: inevitably, your round fictional companion of note is going to follow up their query with some seriously burning meat.

“Just a half-generation ago, your utopian dream of a globally-connected world – in which everyone would be empowered to saturate and culture themselves with new ideas and forms of expression – was the defining aspiration of your society, and yet you’ve definitively achieved Total Connectivity, now, and caused the overwhelmingly opposite result: you’re all intolerable shitheads who every passing solar orbit become less and less capable of anything but regurgitation of the same foul bullshit. Y’all fucking wack. I’m out. ”

And there, that filthy little ball would have us all. Friends, colleagues, human siblings of mine, **it’s long-past time we expect better from ourselves** as music citizens of the world. Even the longest living of us are endowed with very little opportunity to absorb anything more than an infinitesimal fraction of all there is to experience, and we’ve all been carelessly and embarrassingly chucking it to the weeds. If it this all seems excessive, there’s no need to feel attacked, but for Pete’s sake… please stop claiming you “like music” because it’s misleadingly inaccurate and I’ll promise never to use the phrase “music citizens of the world” again, in exchange.

# Distribution & Curation

**You, your friends, and I are missing out on way too much cool shit** and we’re going to continue addressing possible causes and solutions to this ongoing catastrophe without asking for a single moved finger on your part because we are fucking saints. Let’s come back to ground and consider a casual real-world use case for a streaming service which I’ve observed.

*It’s just after 1PM on an especially beautiful Summer day in 2018, and you’ve decided with your two best friends that an impromptu hot dog barbecue in your little apartment’s parking lot would be a great way to spend the afternoon. You get on Facebook Messenger – no time to bother with the formality of creating an event – and begin to bother your group of art school friends. In a few hours, you’ve set up chairs in a circle around the borrowed fire pit, gathered meat tubes, marshmallows, and beer, and your guests have begun to arrive. The next step: retrieve your cordless Bluetooth speaker from inside to place it atop a log nearest the scene, re-pair it with your smartphone, and ___?*

Let’s acknowledge that music has incredibly diverse purposes of value in human life—*of course* I realize this—and ultimately, nobody can dictate those fulfilled for another individual by any given track, album, artist, or genre across time and setting. Even splittercore-obsessed serial killers and body modding cybergrind disciples are doomed: inevitably, they will one day let their guard down and find themselves singing along with “Goodbye Earl” on the radio way off key, smiling like a doofus. Even if one hates humanity, they will eventually be forced to acknowledge that The Dixie Chicks came very close to its penultimate manifestation.

I understand that it’s not *always* time for something new for everyone, but you’re missing out on music’s most worthwhile function by far if you never seek anything fresh, and—if you still find yourself unwilling to bother, even—carrying around even the slightest bit of anecdotal knowledge about *what’s going on* in music with you can be invaluably culturing to your image when socializing with youths and alien intelligences, alike. There is a spectrum of enthusiasm (or pretentiousness, depending on one’s own subjectives) for music that is far more culturally consequential than the practice of partaking and/or patroning any other artform. Settle comfortably on any point – extreme or not – and you’re at serious risk of being uncool. Nobody wants Anthony Fantano showing up to their party, but if you live too long confusing the Beach Boys with the Beatles – as I have – folks start to behave as if there’s something wrong with you. If it helps, let’s suppose this to be the *real* reason behind my need to discuss Bandcamp – perhaps its relative lack of aged or worshiped-at-scale work justifies it all.

By this nature, its effort is designed to bracket the enthusiast as wholly as possible, but the value most in need of its experience has become its comparatively extravagant hospitality for the dabbler. The “[Discoverinator](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/07/behold-the-glory-of-the-discoverinator/)” (I would’ve voted for calling it “Genre-Fucker”) is simply *the* most ingenious tool available anywhere to filter music by genre, subgenre, location, and medium. Or at least... It’s too gorgeous not to be. Thanks to its recent visual redesign, I don’t even care if it’s useful—it’s just a beautiful thing to play with on both the Web and the iOS app (though I’d bet they were each crafted separately.)

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOaEAR9Da70?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Front and center on the homepage is the [Bandcamp Daily](http://daily.bandcamp.com/) – a showcase of features, lists, albums of the day, and artist interviews from various staff and guest contributors which I’d most certainly judge befit of a standalone publication – and the [*Bandcamp Weekly*](https://bandcamp.com/?show) – an extraordinarily-produced podcast like no other with special mixes, guest appearances, and commentary which the company’s [Chief Curator Andrew Jervis](https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis) has been honing [since 2013](http://bandcamp.com/?show=1) over 289 episodes as of [this morning](http://bandcamp.com/?show=289). Its player functions both in-browser and on the iOS app unlike any I’ve ever seen, with a list of embedded tracks that pop out when they’re actually spinning on the show so that you can engage further with them, if you wish. It’s difficult to describe, but it feels visually like you’re listening to a playlist in Bandcamp’s normal player, except tracks are intermixed and faded between one another beneath the host’s commentary, so the audio itself must be pre-rendered. Regardless, it’s nearly as extraordinary an achievement in Web design as the program itself is in curatorial music broadcasting. I’m no addict to the genre, but I have yet to Discover another similar product which I can binge episode after episode for hours without becoming bored or irritated as I can the *Bandcamp Weekly*’s.

To fill in the parking lot party blank with a single streaming solution for the sake of our young, art school-attending, likely more musically-literate than average summer barbecue guests—how viable is Bandcamp? Truthfully, it’s only slightly more suited now than it was in its earliest infancy for obediently filling a space with ambiance. We could ponder whether or not its design discourages absentminded playback only consequently, or perhaps condescendingly from the high, white tower of hipster elitism on which you’ll occasionally hear it accused of perching, but UX design is *the* most ridiculous sphere within which to intenspeculate in lieu of verification (gazing at you with the timeless grace of a thousand moons, *Medium,*) so lets hold off to seek out an interview with a Bandcamp representative.

SoundCloud would be a bit closer to the mark—it can be configured to simply *keep going* after you’ve finished a track, regardless of where you may be within the interface (excluding the embedded player, of course)—but it’d be much safer to spend the smidgen of extra time required to find a manmade playlist. Letting it loose will quickly land you on some seriously dubious (and probably embarrassing) nerd shit. As I understand it, YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player because of its universality, Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free [YouTube Music service](https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services) has a lot of potential, in theory, but we’re *outside* in this scenario and our smartphone is our only playback device.

Startlingly, the Web’s given best answer to this situation is still Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony. *Internet radio*? Yikes. You can still find a gem of a stream every once in a while, but they’re usually unreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won’t last you more than a few hours before you’ll start to hear repeats. You could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio station—a *student* radio station, even—but those offering the most entertaining programming are unlikely to have a suitable playlist on a summer afternoon. So—forgetting its overwhelming financial funneling toward its top 10% and everything else for a moment—why not just give up the pretense and use Spotify? Again, for most of my friends, it works just fine to play Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I have yet to figure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target within even the most rudimentary parameters. Such ill-restraint becomes especially dire—necessary, really—when I queue up “Cannibal Ox Radio” for the office and R Kelly ends up playing, 20 minutes in. Using personally-targeted artist bans is probably too subjective to ask of such a service in the spotlight, but **how about an option to filter out white rappers**? (I hope you didn’t blink because that’s by far my best contribution in tech writing yet.)

The truth is, I’d probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I’ve been an on-and-off subscriber since its release, but have yet to meet a single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is [reportedly still nearly ](https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/)[25% larger](https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/), its UI is significantly more cohesively integrated with iOS (which hasn’t always been a given from Apple with its music software, mind you,) yet it costs me precisely the same $9.99 a month as Spotify Premium would. If I *did* know somebody else who used it, they’d be able to see [my public profile](http://bit.ly/dbapple) including my playlists and activity, just as my followers on Spotify can, and I can create “Stations” for artists that function similarly to Spotify’s endless adaptive playlists, but—crucially, for myself—after the app’s redesign for iOS 10, the integration of Apple Music music with my own iTunes library is completely seamless. With unlimited data, I’ve selected the option to refrain from storing music locally, which further diminishes the distinction between “my” music and the music I’ve paid for the rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay ten bucks a month for “ownership” of *all* the music on iTunes proper.

While I might personally play *Bandcamp Weekly* episodes in such a context and gladly accept whatever results I’d get, I’d only do so acknowledging the subsequently increased risk of some vest-wearing fuck I’ve never met springing out of the bushes to accost me about Weird Allan. However, I am neither cool nor musically literate, which makes me particularly vulnerable to misusing algorithmic Discovery—the practice in which artificial intelligence has become most widely-deployed which continues to prove itself to better deserve the term “automated wallowing,” or “robotized ear rot.”

Ironically, Damon Krukowski’s aforementioned “responsibility” essay on *Pitchfork* openly cites Liz Pelly’s burning-hot and [100%](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly)[ essential analysis](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly) of algorithmically-generated playlists for *The Baffler* notes the publication’s own substantial relationship with Spotify, including a [Webby Award-winning](https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery/) advertorial series called *Inside Discovery*, which the two collaborate to produce that’s “meant to boost awareness of the ‘Discover Weekly’ feature.”

> The series shows Pitchfork editors (and favored musicians) gushing about their love of streaming—the immediacy! The deep back catalogs! One editor says it helps him keep track of his listening habits, while another rejoices at not having to dig through crates at record shops anymore. Yet another likens Spotify to walking around a music festival, discovering something new at every turn. What does it mean for “the most trusted voice in music” to celebrate an algorithm as preferable to its own crate digging? What does it mean when the tastemaking humans endorse data-driven machines? What does it mean when the algorithms become cool? Virtually every music publication now relies on Spotify media players to embed songs within online articles, and Websites like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone regularly celebrate their playlists with listicles: “Ten Albums To Stream Now.” “The Five Playlists You Need to Hear This Summer.”

We love bespoke Open Web projects, so exploring *Inside Discovery*’s (surely bespoke) experience induced the same pathetic sort of *I wish business just incentived building nice things* disappointment which has become my default, bitchy mood, and blaming as a further let down to immediately land on [Mitski’s ](https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski)[playlist](https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski), to whom I’d just been [reintroduced](https://pitchfork.com/features/profile/dont-cry-for-mitski/) (by *Pitchfork*, admittedly) after happening upon her performance at Pitchfork 2017 (which is organized, admittedly, by *Pitchfork*.)

Upon a brief review of these once-petty desires and the new, apocalyptic solutions which we are burning barns full of cash to develop, it would appear that the overwhelmingly defining feature of those which are at all viable remains to be the interference of a human being, and why wouldn’t it be, still, when manual music aggregation remains so desperately cheap? I’d wager heavily that there’s at least a single editor within Apple Music who’s spent serious time embedded in the Berlin techno scene considering how regularly the prime “Techno” playlist is updated with new work of a moderately-industrial bias.

“The downside to automated music Discovery is that we’re encouraged to develop a taste profile and stick to it,” [opines somebody on *Pigeons & Planes*](https://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2016/03/music-discovery-algorithms), complimenting Pelly in their profile of former BBC Radio 1 host, Zane Lowe, and his new job curating an Apple Music playlist? 

The truth is, the stories that come to us that smell the strongest of philanthropy on the surface are often actually about some dusty, Y2K-lookin’-ass nerd with powerfully tedious grievances and too much time on their hands. The whole world knows the details by now of how Mark Zuckerberg’s horny social ineptitude led to Facebook’s conception, but we must both keep in check the bad habit we share – the whole present-day reading world and I, that is – of dwelling entirely too much on the most “negative,” soul-agitating tales in what we perceive to be the pursuit of necessary ingredients for concocting a better solution. Bandcamp’s story is predominantly comprised of smart decisions, sincere transparency, and savvy ideas which are best examined in contrast, I’m afraid, with all that’s being done *wrong* everywhere else.

> Are my favorite punk bands now Bandcamp bands? Are they suddenly wanting to conform to a kind of Bandcamp aesthetic? I don’t think so. Not yet. But if that does happen, something might be lost — a sense of these bands defining themselves as they want to, which is sort of the Bandcamp promise in the first place. People can use help navigating the riches of Bandcamp. But its estimable editorial project opens an interesting question: When does help turn into tastemaking?

# The Creators

You missed it, didn’t you—the ten-year anniversary of Bandcamp’s launch? Ashamed, I realized last month that I did, too. Ashamed, because I owe a lot to to the platform’s unwavering commitment to the distribution and curation of work made by just about all of my favorite artists—within and outside of my social network. Throughout 2015, I hosted a number of conversations with exceptional, future-looking creators on *Drycast* which I am especially proud of. On one [early episode](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc/a-a4674c) with an exceptional total of *seven* music makers, I observed in a beat that “all of us have Bandcamp accounts,” before the week’s guest, Samantha Carter, suggested that she’d found her page especially financially rewarding, and originated the concept of the “Bandcamp Sugar Daddy” (which I personally ship 100%.)

“It's something I take for granted,” said my friend [yzome](https://twitter.com/yzome) – a [truly one-of-a-kind electronic producer](https://yzome.bandcamp.com/) who’s far-traveling composition is probably the closest Digital Audio Workstation equivalent of Extreme Use Testing—when automotive manufacturers effectively torture new prototypes with the most inhospitable conditions on Earth until they break. However, it’s not a PR stunt in yzome’s case—he’s just very good at doing what he does after doing it for nearly 10 years—and his end product requires a hell of a lot more than any one genre would ever presume, but it more than delivers back on the investment with significant interest.

When [he appeared on *Drycast*](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Electronic-Producer-Yzome-and-his-Alien-Sound-e1lmcj/a-a41qc5) in January 2015, we failed to achieve any descriptors more sophisticated than “alien sounds,” but perhaps that’s all they need: the inner worlds into which yzome invites us are of manic, unpredictable arrhythmia which poses an unapologetic, yet magically lighthearted challenge to any cohesive theory. It’s very rare that his proudly-ungenreable exploration of the fringes does not demand the listener’s full attention, yet it always manages to be *inoffensively aggressive* like **nothing** else, which suggesting promise for the possible upheaval of a long-upheld natural law among electronic dance music: yzome doesn’t need to be a shithead to challenge the listener intellectually.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=586326190/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=641807133/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://yzome.bandcamp.com/album/yvette">YVETTE by yzome</a></iframe>

Play *[YVETTE](https://yzome.bandcamp.com/album/yvette)* for any boomer you know with that classically impenetrable disgust for *all* electronic music, and you’ll witness firsthand how special yzome’s particular innovation truly is. No, they’re not going to be *sexually liberated*, or anything—it’s still going to be alarming—but you’ll notice that the swift and overwhelming fury which sample and break-heavy dance music has always awoken within them has been miraculously circumvented. Instead of immediately storming off, they’ll be paralyzed in an existential fugue state from which they may never quite fully emerge. I’ve seen it firsthand. It’s witchcraft.

There is no other across the (especially-wide) electronic spectrum who can so loudly go so far, so fast without any insincerity, whatsoever. His arrangement seems mischievous and all over the place, but really listen and you’ll hear rips of recognizable patterns playing peekaboo in willy-nilly bursts that reveal his dynamic mastery of the dance music space through Breakcore, Juke, Footwork, and Techno sampling. All of this is to say, really, that yzome’s music represents a level of boundary-pushing which only a niche audience tends to truly appreciate, yet is undoubtedly worthy of an elegantly-presented host like Bandcamp.

"Like thank god I don't have to look for a label to release this. It's seen as a legitimate platform (by people who might actually care about what I’m doing, at least,) which I think is less offputting than uploading things to Mediafire or whatever else. It’s populist and boutique at the same time."

***Populist, yet boutique***. Can we really be expected to exceed this summation? Well, nobody’s said much at all in the mainstream press, but what *has* been said is 1) unusually misplaced in the spaces of those least likely to find it relevant and 2) *way* more insightful than you’d expect. 

“Bandcamp has an independent-artist identity because of practicalities: Independent artists from Web-centered subcultures need it most,” observed an especially savvy online aside from by [Ben Ratliff](http://benratliff.net/)—jazz and pop critic for *The New York Times—*asking “[Is Bandcamp the Holy Grail of Online Record Stores](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/arts/music/bandcamp-shopping-for-music.html)?” So why aren’t we talking about it? The other important takeaway: founder Ethan Diamond told Ratliff that “the company has never spent money on promotion.” This is largely why I’ve invested so much time and affection into this piece—gratitude is not often sellable incentive for mainstream coverage. 

The truth is, the continued obscurity of Bandcamp’s story despite all it’s done comes down not to any malpractice by the company (in fact, it would likely be more visible had it fucked up more,) or even to its prevalence in the careers of big industry names (whom I will address in detail shortly,) but because it simply operates too magnanimously for its customers to be taken seriously as a newsworthy business, which is problematic and personally infuriating. In November, 2015, Bandcamp made mention in *The New Yorker* via the openly diminutive context of *Car Seat Headrest’s* [origin story](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu), describing it as “a charming alternative,” and “a casual, low-risk approach.” Granted, it’s worth noting that the platform did not address its lack of “editorial guidance” until a year later, with the [launch](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/06/13/welcome-to-bandcamp-daily/) of the excellent *Bandcamp Daily* blog, but I think you’ll agree it’s in poor taste to argue against the legitimacy of a *music* distribution platform because it’s *too democratic.* Perhaps it’s still just beyond reasonable expectations to get a top-of-the-foodchain music writer’s head wrapped around the idea that such products on The Internet can easily—even optimally—service both hobbyists and professionals.

Last year, Bandcamp was responsible for [$270 million in payments](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/02/12/the-bandcamp-2017-year-in-review/) to artists like Jlin,the genius commonly associated with Footwork (certainly Chicago’s most underreported and popularly underrepresented movement,) for pushing its expressive boundaries both in theory and geography further than any other, and who’s so far produced two of the most “[aggressively](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/qvv37m/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively-beautiful-music-youve-ever-heard)[ beautiful](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/qvv37m/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively-beautiful-music-youve-ever-heard)” records you’ll find anywhere in the process.[[i\]](#_edn1) Type her name into any search engine and her Bandcamp page is *always* the first result, yet Cntrl-Fing for “Bandcamp” will yield 0 results from her interviews with *The Fader*, *FACT Magazine*, *Pitchfork*, *The Seventh Hex*, *Passion of the Weiss*, *PopMatters*, *Crack Magazine*, *DUMMY*, *The Guardian*, *The Quietus*, *BOMB Magazine*, *Ableton Blog*, *The Creative Independent*, *Rolling Stone*, *SPIN*, *No Fear of Pop*, *self-titled magazine*, *Circulation Magazine*, *The New Yorker*, *Cyclic Defrost*, *Mixmag*, or *melting bot*, and only one in *Interview Magazine*. To be clear: I am **not** arguing that Jlin—a black female music artist—should be profusely thanking Bandcamp—a service founded largely by white male programmers—for hosting her most visible page but rather that the more independent of these publications, especially, should mention its role in her story or—at the very least—be hyperlinking to [her Bandcamp page](https://jlin.bandcamp.com/) first, for both her’s and their readers’ sake—Bandcamp’s cut of album purchases is half of iTunes. From the user experience perspective, it’s absurd that those of these pages including embedded music players chose to use SoundCloud’s—which is more resource heavy (yet of noticeably lesser streaming playback quality) and visually disruptive—instead of [Bandcamp’s](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/06/12/all-new-players-up-twitter-too/).

<iframe style="border: 0; width: auto; height: auto;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2765736108/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://jlin.bandcamp.com/album/black-origami">Black Origami by Jlin</a></iframe>

The two services were launched the same year—that fateful 2008—but comparing them is complicated. They are clear opposites in at least one principal: how they’ve defined their mission. Bandcamp has changed less throughout its history than any other Web service that comes to mind (see below,) but SoundCloud has struggled with identity issues, to their vastly-superior success (in terms of user statistics, anyway.) *The New York Times* [reported in June, 2011](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/soundcloud-an-audio-sharing-site-hits-5-million-users/) that they’d reached 5 million users, citing their decision to expand focus beyond “popular music” to explain the milestone. “We’re building a sound platform that’s not just about music,” said Alex Ljung – a SoundCloud co-founder and the company’s chief executive at the time – and its present landscape certainly reflects a diverse offering of uses, but ultimately, any . Today, both SoundCloud and Bandcamp have premium subscription plans for artists which are at least *perceived* to be competitive with one another—[SoundCloud Pro](https://blog.soundcloud.com/2013/03/11/introducing-soundcloud-pro/) and [Bandcamp Pro](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/25/new-features-up/), respectively—along with free base experiences, which we’ll compare first.

**Free Bandcamp Account
 Uploads**: quantity unlimited, size of each file limited to 291mb.
 **Distribution**: unlimited streaming, up to 200 free downloads per month.

**Free SoundCloud Account
 Uploads**: total of 3 hours uploaded at any given time.
 **Distribution**: unlimited streaming, unlimited downloads.

Both offer access “basic” statistics for their tracks at this tier which most of the creators I know consider more than enough—the usefulness of any playback/download stats is negligible when you’re publishing within tight niches—and each has had about 5 years to fine-tune their free offerings so that they feel as complete as possible. If you’re planning on publishing a podcast on SoundCloud, you’re obviously going to have to upgrade your upload limit even beyond Pro ($8/month, 6-hour upload limit) to Pro Unlimited ($16/month, unlimited uploads,) though I would suggest a plethora of alternative methods before you got that far. Unfortunately, they would not include a free Bandcamp account. While [there ](https://bandcamp.com/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover)*are* [podcasts on Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover), they’re completely separate the platform’s aspirations and without support for the basic requirements of podcast distribution (namely, RSS feeds.)

Bandcamp’s Pro option is $10 a month and includes a custom domain, batch file uploading, private streaming (for press and/or fans) plus the ability to disable *free* streaming (requiring listeners to actually buy the music to enable any playback,) ad-free video hosting (which nobody uses, to my knowledge,) extended fan interaction tools, and a broader statistics suite that includes Google Analytics support. SoundCloud’s Pro and Pro Unlimited options are complimentary, but a full-time independent artist could justify maintaining Pro accounts on both services or neither—one does not necessarily replace the other, but the contrast in their chosen presentations has led to a divide in the cultures of the two communities so stark [it could be a punchline](http://www.thefader.com/2017/04/03/bandcamp-artists-vs-soundcloud-artists-meme) and/or simplified to say that *SoundCloud is for rap* and *Bandcamp is not*.

It’s not entirely shocking, then, that SoundCloud’s story has been more present in the greater conversation than Bandcamp’s. Frankly, its largest issues are directly related: compared to SoundCloud, **Bandcamp’s community is White As Fuck** (a claim I can only make on behalf of my own observations and those which a select few creators have seen fit to express to me over the years, considering that the company has yet to release any demographic information about its creators) which is a glaringly fundamental obstruction to the project’s broader mission to help music culture “[thrive](https://bandcamp.com/about).”

From a future historian’s perspective, the battle for the definitive name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who’s quickly become a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my generation’s upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud *earned* his partnership or landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to [give new meaning](https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper) to the phrase “serially likable.” Thus far, his mythical power to exude purity has felt virtually 100% airtight Last year, his second album *Coloring Book* made history when it won the [first streaming-only ](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/12/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy/)[Grammy for Best Album](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/12/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy/). In my personal favorite moment in recent popular culture memory, the fashionable-as-hell young man [accepted the accolade](https://youtu.be/FkAJ_BU66Zs) by looking the whole industry establishment in the face and proclaiming “this is for every indie artist—everybody who’s been doin’ this mixtape shhhh...*tuff* for a long ass time... shouts out to every independent artist out there; [shouts out to SoundCloud for holding me down](https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14594672/chance-the-rapper-grammy-awards-2017-soundcloud).” Obviously, such significant, sentimental, and sincere sentiments are *never* expressed about tech companies by beloved darlings of the art world like Chance—especially not for Earth-encompassing awards show audiences.

After [last year’s massive layoff](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15928674/soundcloud-cuts-40-percent-staff), it was [Chance’s assurances](https://twitter.com/chancetherapper/status/885921220759355397) that “SoundCloud is here to stay” which the public took to heart. Even if the company *is* destined to fail within the next year (it appears to be as yet missing much of a verdict,) and it’s all still destined to fold at any moment, at least it’ll have the distinct pride of doing so having maintained his publicly-expressed respect and confidence, which is a damned fine legacy in my book. Meanwhile, Bandcamp has only made a few small tweaks to its basic infrastructure, and added new features very deliberately, which haven’t resulted in a single memorable controversy. Aside from [Amanda Palmer](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/07/amanda-palmer-sells-15k-on-bandcampin-three-minute.html), perhaps, there has never been a single band or artist who’ve been known as “from Bandcamp,” leaving our only pitch to be something like *Independent Online Music Platform on Track to Complete 10th Year Serving Small-Time Artists, Continues to Look Pretty Good*.

Considering the significance of these contributions, it’s of a special wonder that they were made not by a non-profit organization, academic movement, or government endowment, but by a for-profit, California-based tech company that’s continued to thrive and innovate great content, entirely apart from mainstream coverage.

# The Future

It might seem a bit much on the surface, but in many ways, Bandcamp has spent the past 10 years showing us what a for-profit, Web-based, culturally-edging independent platform Can be, even in the Valley.

Though Bandcamp has embarked upon unusually sparse explanation of its editorial directive in the *Daily* blog and *Weekly* podcast, but regularly consume either for any length of time, and you’ll notice a particular savvy for Discovering technically-progressive Afrocentric projects: “[Black Experimental Music](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/08/05/a-guide-to-black-experimental-music/).”

On [last week’s episode](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/podcasts/still-processing-tin-house-inclusion-hannah-gadsby.html) of the excellent *New York Times* podcast *Still Processing*, co-host Jena Wortham “I’m thinking a lot about ways in which new culture, new cultural products, new cultural creators come to light in ways that sidestep these traditional means and don’t have to go through the traditionally very white, very male, very cis, very hetero hoops to prove worthiness.”

So, our greatest hope for the decentralization of the music industry in the 1990s ended up transforming before us to become the most effectively divisive Discovery barrier ever known to man because of its psychological influence sub-threshold at unprecedented scale over time, in parallel with so many other like horrific monstrosities we’ve discovered in anguish to be mutants of those final salvations from our atrocious history which we’d been so relieved to believe in. Surely, the turn of the millennia was destined to be our final turning point – the moment we’d finally use our new technology to discover a truth (or maybe just a really good clue,) that’d immediately unite our species in a deafening, worldwide aha moment when it would reveal a general abstract of whatever the fuck our deal was that was preventing our silent, dutiful, and 100% harmonious collective effort toward a utopia like *Star Trek: The Next Generation*’s, in which anyone is absolutely free of obligation or desperation from birth to pursue… whatever with their time.

# Virtual Reality Virginity, Lost

![VR Virgin](https://i.snap.as/4LDha0S.jpg)

## A late geezer’s first go at the dystopian VR experience

Earlier this year, Tim and I had the opportunity to try virtual reality at the True/False Film Festival in a dark, curtained side room of a commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much too intoxicated and loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we bailed. Call us cowards if you must — *immersion* can be a scary concept to those of us who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the modern video game console. I’ve wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair of goggles, just to have an idea of what the increasing number of Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to Isiah, I was finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos and *Farpoint*’s introduction on a PlayStation 4.

First, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how exactly to adjust it, but I forget it all and simply try to shove it directly and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back and simply mounts and adjusts it around my monstrous skull — like you would for a toddler — and I lay eyes on the console for the first time. For whatever reason, it never occurred to me that general GUI wouldn’t simply be displayed in 2D, but by a literal *virtual display*, layed out in front of me like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I’m astonished by my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of *Goggleworld*, which is nothing but a deeply black void.

From my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what to show me first, and YouTube is the settled-upon environment. As the application is restarted in “VR Mode,” its startup screen is what *really* establishes the truth — I have *gone virtual*. I cannot use my hands to shield my eyes from the branding’s glaring watermark and terrifying red light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the “VR” tab, revealing a selection of thumbnails for algorithmically-recommended VR-shot videos on the service.

To begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it’s raced around an American desert circuit. It takes a few seconds for high resolution to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that would surely make anyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was especially excited to become nauseous, to no avail.) At the getgo, I am occupied with the rider’s butt since it’s center-frame if I stand in my usual posture. Isiah points out the hovering HUD to my left containing a selection of simulated digital instruments (tachometer, 7-segment speedo, etc.) Its presence would suggest that the purpose of my virtual passengership is to witness the lap as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider obscures most of my view forward — I cannot admire his line as one would viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to try and figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the vehicle is tossed about in the required movements of motorbike operation, I myself (the VR capture device) am impressively gyrostabilized, and the image, static, as if I’m *actually* hovering above the pair as they moved along. I spin left and right, spotting a small gaggle of miniature wind turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the foreground. Behind them, small sand dunes fill the space, all the way to the horizon.

After a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap for a short *National Geographic* documentary on a Viking revival festival in Poland. I’m introduced to its Big Boys by a series of aerial shots (presumably by drone, which is awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their Big Boat up(?) a relatively wide, tree-lined river. In contrast with the lap, the jump cuts become a bit disorienting — I am eventually jumped *in* the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty, bearded lads — a few of whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry church on the distant bank. Suddenly, I float briskly across the small no man’s land between two rapidly advancing battle lines of Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific weapons and way too much free time. More lingering drone shots follow from just a few feet above the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms Hawthorn’s suggestion that this is, indeed, *the one where they use real weapons* as I notice a pile of three or four men lying against each other, motionless on the ground, right-of-center in the nearest line, and mull over the sure disturbance of all this immersion the festival has allowed in welcoming the presence of the surely-buzzing drone. *I guess they’re dead*.

After the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head and rather large feet with rather small toes, which he likes to wiggle during these particular conversations. Thanks to VR’s omniencompassing perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling in his every appearance. The tone of the background music and the prevalence of relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the scenes suggest romanticism is the montage’s theme, but for me, it is the bald man’s feet — I am too busy conversing with my two friends, across the divide, in this world, to listen to any of what is said. Considering that YouTube collects the dimensional data regarding where the user looks, and for how long, I make an effort to bend my neck up and down in extremes, and notice a patch of washed-out sky, distorting in the distance, and ponder what — if anything — we have gained in this technology.

![VR Vertical](https://i.snap.as/ihtaDMF.jpg)

Does an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the viewer actually make motion picture storytelling more effective? In the few minutes of my VR taste test, I *did* gain quite a bit of volition over an equivalent 2D experience, but it didn’t seem like I’d instinctively used it to gain much else. If one is specifically interested in the shrubbery around a racetrack, or the more nuanced undulations of a Viking’s foot, they can more likely than not find a standard video on the World Wide Web that would more efficiently entertain them. In specific situations, of course, a producer can undoubtedly benefit by the ability to capture in 360 degrees, but — in any sort of cinema, especially — it seems unnecessarily sacrificial to relinquish entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to their audience. However, I am the antiexpert on this subject, obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant and — quite possibly — very wrong, but my time in its hell is not over yet.

Isiah explains that it is time for me to *game*, and asks if I’d like to try “the one with the hands, or the one with the gun.” As always, I choose the firearm, as the “hands” have not been found yet and the hypothetical image immediately offered up by my imagination is of rusty iron shackles. The Infinite Blackness has returned, and I cannot see beyond it to determine what my host is up to. Then, it becomes outer space — filling with thousands of starlike white dots. The light-blue outline of a virtual PlayStation controller appears where I assume him to be, unattached and bumbling about. Soon, it jaggedly approaches, and I feel him hand it to me. We have started its calibration process, which becomes a bit frightening in my celestial surroundings, though at least I have now gained participatory power over my new existence. I’d opted out of wearing headphones, so the assistant’s malignant-sounding female British voice comes softly from the television somewhere in front of me as I point the beam of light the controller’s representation is now projecting straight forward at the navigational arrows displayed ahead and pull “the trigger” (R2.)

I am pleased by the idea of interfacing with software exclusively by shooting it repeatedly before I am abruptly contained in a cage, now being projected by a virtualization of the system’s sensor, which is unsettling. I am now calibrating the hardware contained within the physical device that captures the position of my body in the physical world. I catch the word “confinement” in the assistant’s unending, otherwise-inaudible directions, and quicken my pace. When it’s all done, I return the controller to Isiah, who reboots the PS4, itself, before launching *Farpoint*. My space becomes a lighter blue and fills with little opaque bits of Sony Dust for a minute or two. Isiah continues his rummaging for another peripheral as the title’s introduction begins to play.

Two rather poorly-animated astronauts are co-hosting a live broadcast from their craft, which is presented in a dramatization of a computer display. They’ve just met, but they’re both stacked with academia, co-massaging their knowledge, which I choose not to listen to. Out of view, Isiah unsuccessfully attempts to skip the whole thing before I’m allowed to become *virtual* again — this time, atop the animated body of another astronaut in a lone shuttle, approaching the mothership where it holds, next to a large, very-*Star Trek* “anomaly.” From Deep Space Nine, the two scientists continue to bicker over comms as I look around the cockpit. Looking backwards has already become a favorite habit of mine — I wonder where the shuttle’s bathroom is. For whatever reason, the back of my character’s neck was animated, though it can only be seen by looking rearwards and down, which distorts its shape into something truly terrifying.

A bunch of unrelated plot follows, leading me to end up on a foreign world, exiting my crashed escape pod. By now, Isiah has connected *The Gun*, but something about it isn’t quite right — my character holds it in a glitched, very uncomfortable-looking manner, and it’s suspected that a fix would require a restart, and therefore — a replay of the introductory cutscene — so I retire out of lack of patience.

If I were confidently reviewing PlayStation VR as a consumer purchase, I’d cite a quote of Isiah’s: “I couldn’t find the thing.” In addition to my first drone sighting, a few days ago in Colorado, this lost virtual virginity is not necessarily unwelcome — I feel as though I’ve acquired a platform to better ponder the dystopia to which these and their like industries add a certain comic spice. That said, I cannot imagine a reason to once again enter the digital realm — and *who cares*?

Please enjoy your new worlds, kids.

# Revelations in Web Starvation

![Opera No Connection](https://i.snap.as/9wsQDXz.png)

*Opera's no-connection mascot is the cutest branding on any current web browser. Fight me.*

Yesterday, I finished moving out of the situation I’d been living in for ~6 weeks in the basement of a southeast Portland home near the western base of Mt. Tabor. You'd see it just across from the flat Washington Mall-ish grass rectangle that provides daring suburban explorers their most worthwhile reward for reaching the top. It resembles one of many local residential templates which I was completely unequipped to understand when I arrived in the area last year. You'll never observe any of its inhabitants outside doing any of the things people do when they are unaware of - or unconcerned with being observed. Walking by an afternoon front yard “family gathering” (young white parents and their one or two children) is a prospect of haste. Introducing new movement to the vicinity after the sun has gone down stirs a disruption from deep within its energy. Everyone in this town is afraid. I say it’s an unnatural way to live, but I’m just a fucking bumpkin.

As you may or may not have observed, the vast majority of my working being lives on the World Wide Web, which requires, fundamentally…. An internet connection. In most any other present-day first world circumstance, these are infinitely available, but I discovered – after the moving process was entirely completed, of course – that my tenants did **not** actually have an in-house connection of their own. They explained to me that their neighbor – an “IT professional” for IBM – had offered to let them use *his* WiFi network, and they’d found the arrangement sufficient. However, because IBM is *The* archaic marque of digital fascism (disclosure: they are also my [sworn blood enemy](http://bilge.world/compaq),) it wasn’t altogether a surprise when they told me that his offer did not extend to “guests.”

I considered that a defined period of WiFi fasting at home could make for an interesting experiment - perhaps even a needed mental reset - and I couldn't reasonably afford to acquire my own dedicated 4G hotspot, anyway. The reality became a relentless paranoid battle for any trickle of access - sometimes for *a dozen bytes per second*; for just the most basic digital communications like SMS and email - which led to more superstitious hypotheses about precarious antenna orientation, progress bar hallucinations, out-of-control frustration, and hopeless fixation with refresh commands than I remember from 2nd generation cell networks in the Midwest, 10 years ago, or even domestic dial-up, and truly revealed the extent to which I'd taken connectivity for granted.

My observations of my own behavior throughout this drought are worth more than their mild amusement: even this petty disparity (I was never more than two or three yards from nearly-whole signal at the top of the outside stairs) re-sensitized my perspective to the abstract concept of network unreliability which I'd been entirely spared since prepubescence. Though 4 billion human beings now regularly interact with the World Wide Web, their connections span a mathematically gargantuan spectrum of speed and reliability. In urbanizing myself as an adult, I have unconsciously latched on to the entitled ideal that internet access is a public service and accepted dramatically-increasing dependence on services that engorge greater and greater volumes of bandwidth without any explanation but their lack of incentives for efficiency. I reflect on my relationship with technology every day, yet I still became an oblivious data glutton in mind-bogglingly little time.

The current state of connectivity in the United States, alone is quite alarming under 5-year-absent examination. Mobile carriers are [*still* merging](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-sprint-corp-m-a-t-mobile-us/t-mobile-runs-behind-the-scenes-pr-push-to-support-sprint-deal-idUSKCN1L512A) and the compartmentalization of *all* ISP customers between prioritization tiers continues to be tested, [less encumbered by regulatory safeguards](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition) than ever. I don't know my politics on this issue, nor do I have any specific solutions, but I'd point to the work of the [National Digital Inclusion Alliance](http://digitalinclusion.org/), and express only that I hope the pace of the technology's progress is greater than the growth of its merchants' imaginations and the scope of their greed so that the sheer volume of plenty overcomes even the shortest-sighted, and humanity as a whole continues toward a more just distribution of connectivity. What I *am* in a position to share are the revelations about our current infrastructure, software services, and hardware devices I could only have discovered from such an experience.

## Variables

I remember standing on top of a John Deere combine's 15ft-high roof in order to successfully make a telephone call 10 years ago - one of thousands of behaviors which were more abruptly and universally required for a few years and subsequently more abruptly forgotten than any other such united tick in American history. This blip of shared technological adversity also led to an unfathomably vast collective mythology surrounding incredibly tedious manipulation of our archaic handsets in varying degrees of desperation for *just one bar*.

My Sprint plan includes unlimited 4G LTE data for my iPhone 8 Plus with a 10GB tethering limit - which performed so admirably in the lonely role of my thin tether to the rest of the world that I am obligated to actually use the phrase ***like a champ\***. but the quality of its connection is dramatically impacted by the studio apartment's depth. From the space's geometric center at stomach-level, the handset indicates "1x," meaning CDMA 1x, which *is* technically a data connection, but certainly not in any usable sense for the network applications of 2018\. The native Twitter app, Apple Mail, Snapchat, Instagram & Facebook, Safari, Opera Mini, Firefox, Chrome, and all others I tested in this condition would simply timeout – giving up after a minute or two of repeated attempts before declining to continue, each in their own minor variations. An interesting anecdote: in a pertinent reflection our human ballooning expectations for connectivity at all times, the language of our creations across both iOS and desktop applications has recently become noticeably less accountable and more accusatory. Instead of saying “____ can’t connect to the internet,” many of the browsers will declare an absolute: *three is no internet connection*, or just straight up **blame** the user: “*you* are not connected to the internet." (Emphasis mine.) No apologies... No regrets.

> Dude, no wifi? Where the fuck are U?

Directly above my head’s place on the bed, the phone could be propped on the sill of the East-facing window on a clear-skied day, enabling it to scrounge up and loosely establish enough contact to receive calls and text messages, claiming 1-4 3G “bars,” and a single in 4G at night, though one overcast Northwestern week basically did it in completely. If we were actually doing something to noticeably increase our old Nokia boxes’ bandwidth bids on those early networks by turning them every which way to find “better reception,” it’s completely futile on current devices. (I’m fairly sure I remember a network professional explaining this to me when LTE was first gaining traction.) It was immediately apparent that orientation had no effect, but the handset’s bearing certainly did… Most sensitively so. I realized quite early on that I should endeavor not to spend too much time standing in different positions throughout the space attempting to will on a browser loader bar above a story I’ve probably read already. Intstead, I committed to the very first position that indicated any correlation whatsoever with a better connection: atop the biscuit tin on the metal rack nearest the outside door.

It’s been three months, but I’m still using my tired old Hewlett-Packard 6930p [backup machine](http://bilge.world/linux-bitch/), so I was very skeptical about the odds we’d be successfully reliably pairing its ancient network adapter – [now worth just $9.99](http://a.co/d/ij9mfeD) – with that of A Cellular Phone 10 years its junior without struggling significantly with range or reliability, especially considering that it cannot run a single one of its [vast library of proprietary drivers](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c01538039) on Linux. You’d at least assume they’d need to be practically touching each other to maintain a smooth marriage, yet the only compromise I had to make on the local end was to bring them near to each other as they paired. Afterwards, I could return the phone to its tin and work on the laptop from the kitchen table, 12-15 feet away. (Curiously enough, the 6930p itself shipped with hotspot capability by way of the SIM card slot behind the unit’s main battery.)

Quantifying the speed of a mobile data connection as you would a dedicated WiFi network is incongruent because the former trades in a much less consistent packet stream. That’s the extent of my knowledge, but it’s easy to visualize: a signal that can travel a mile or two in big globules bound to be intercepted in splashes upon the device’s little antennae, versus your home network’s local, evenly distributed sauna of irradiated mist. It’s much less definite, to say the least, and I can’t actually comprehend the sort of voodoo that’s required in order to expand and maintain the networks as they are, nor would I ever wish to burden myself with such knowledge.

# Virtual Reality Virginity, Lost

![VR Virgin](https://i.snap.as/4LDha0S.jpg)

## A late geezer’s first go at the dystopian VR experience

Earlier this year, Tim and I had the opportunity to try virtual reality at the True/False Film Festival in a dark, curtained side room of a commandeered Columbia art gallery, but we were both much too intoxicated and loopy those last few hours of the fest, and we bailed. Call us cowards if you must — *immersion* can be a scary concept to those of us who grew up reading science fiction, before the existence of the modern video game console. I’ve wanted just 30 seconds or so with a pair of goggles, just to have an idea of what the increasing number of Oculus-blinded pedestrians surrounding me are looking at. Thanks to Isiah, I was finally caught up last night with a few VR YouTube videos and *Farpoint*’s introduction on a PlayStation 4.

First, Isiah brings me the headset and describes in detail how exactly to adjust it, but I forget it all and simply try to shove it directly and violently on my face. Eventually, he takes it back and simply mounts and adjusts it around my monstrous skull — like you would for a toddler — and I lay eyes on the console for the first time. For whatever reason, it never occurred to me that general GUI wouldn’t simply be displayed in 2D, but by a literal *virtual display*, layed out in front of me like a large, floor-mounted touch workstation. I’m astonished by my ability to turn away from it to look at the rest of *Goggleworld*, which is nothing but a deeply black void.

From my previous world, I hear Isiah and Hawthorn discussing what to show me first, and YouTube is the settled-upon environment. As the application is restarted in “VR Mode,” its startup screen is what *really* establishes the truth — I have *gone virtual*. I cannot use my hands to shield my eyes from the branding’s glaring watermark and terrifying red light. At its home menu, Isiah simply selects the “VR” tab, revealing a selection of thumbnails for algorithmically-recommended VR-shot videos on the service.

To begin, I am mounted on the tail of a superbike as it’s raced around an American desert circuit. It takes a few seconds for high resolution to buffer, leaving me briefly in a pixelized hell that would surely make anyone sick, were they exposed very long. (I was especially excited to become nauseous, to no avail.) At the getgo, I am occupied with the rider’s butt since it’s center-frame if I stand in my usual posture. Isiah points out the hovering HUD to my left containing a selection of simulated digital instruments (tachometer, 7-segment speedo, etc.) Its presence would suggest that the purpose of my virtual passengership is to witness the lap as a motorsport enthusiast, but the rear of the rider obscures most of my view forward — I cannot admire his line as one would viewing a GoPro-or-otherwise POV of the same event, so I decide to try and figure out which track I am hurried through. Though the vehicle is tossed about in the required movements of motorbike operation, I myself (the VR capture device) am impressively gyrostabilized, and the image, static, as if I’m *actually* hovering above the pair as they moved along. I spin left and right, spotting a small gaggle of miniature wind turbines and two wilting hilltop trees in the foreground. Behind them, small sand dunes fill the space, all the way to the horizon.

After a few minutes, I am finally relieved early of my cutless lap for a short *National Geographic* documentary on a Viking revival festival in Poland. I’m introduced to its Big Boys by a series of aerial shots (presumably by drone, which is awfully un-Vikinglike) as they row their Big Boat up(?) a relatively wide, tree-lined river. In contrast with the lap, the jump cuts become a bit disorienting — I am eventually jumped *in* the boat for a moment, next to the sweaty, bearded lads — a few of whom are shirtless. I notice a blurry church on the distant bank. Suddenly, I float briskly across the small no man’s land between two rapidly advancing battle lines of Nordic Nerds with real, era-specific weapons and way too much free time. More lingering drone shots follow from just a few feet above the ensuing conflict. Outside, Isiah confirms Hawthorn’s suggestion that this is, indeed, *the one where they use real weapons* as I notice a pile of three or four men lying against each other, motionless on the ground, right-of-center in the nearest line, and mull over the sure disturbance of all this immersion the festival has allowed in welcoming the presence of the surely-buzzing drone. *I guess they’re dead*.

After the conflict, I am subjected to a dreamier, narrated montage accompanied by cheesy synthesized orchestral music and featuring disproportionately a particular man with a shiny, tatted bald head and rather large feet with rather small toes, which he likes to wiggle during these particular conversations. Thanks to VR’s omniencompassing perspective, I am allowed to observe his wiggling in his every appearance. The tone of the background music and the prevalence of relaxed, conversing couples and sunsets in the scenes suggest romanticism is the montage’s theme, but for me, it is the bald man’s feet — I am too busy conversing with my two friends, across the divide, in this world, to listen to any of what is said. Considering that YouTube collects the dimensional data regarding where the user looks, and for how long, I make an effort to bend my neck up and down in extremes, and notice a patch of washed-out sky, distorting in the distance, and ponder what — if anything — we have gained in this technology.

![VR Vertical](https://i.snap.as/ihtaDMF.jpg)

Does an increase in the raw amount of visual data available to the viewer actually make motion picture storytelling more effective? In the few minutes of my VR taste test, I *did* gain quite a bit of volition over an equivalent 2D experience, but it didn’t seem like I’d instinctively used it to gain much else. If one is specifically interested in the shrubbery around a racetrack, or the more nuanced undulations of a Viking’s foot, they can more likely than not find a standard video on the World Wide Web that would more efficiently entertain them. In specific situations, of course, a producer can undoubtedly benefit by the ability to capture in 360 degrees, but — in any sort of cinema, especially — it seems unnecessarily sacrificial to relinquish entirely the narrative directorial control of shot framing to their audience. However, I am the antiexpert on this subject, obviously. My take on the viability of VR is Virtually Redundant and — quite possibly — very wrong, but my time in its hell is not over yet.

Isiah explains that it is time for me to *game*, and asks if I’d like to try “the one with the hands, or the one with the gun.” As always, I choose the firearm, as the “hands” have not been found yet and the hypothetical image immediately offered up by my imagination is of rusty iron shackles. The Infinite Blackness has returned, and I cannot see beyond it to determine what my host is up to. Then, it becomes outer space — filling with thousands of starlike white dots. The light-blue outline of a virtual PlayStation controller appears where I assume him to be, unattached and bumbling about. Soon, it jaggedly approaches, and I feel him hand it to me. We have started its calibration process, which becomes a bit frightening in my celestial surroundings, though at least I have now gained participatory power over my new existence. I’d opted out of wearing headphones, so the assistant’s malignant-sounding female British voice comes softly from the television somewhere in front of me as I point the beam of light the controller’s representation is now projecting straight forward at the navigational arrows displayed ahead and pull “the trigger” (R2.)

I am pleased by the idea of interfacing with software exclusively by shooting it repeatedly before I am abruptly contained in a cage, now being projected by a virtualization of the system’s sensor, which is unsettling. I am now calibrating the hardware contained within the physical device that captures the position of my body in the physical world. I catch the word “confinement” in the assistant’s unending, otherwise-inaudible directions, and quicken my pace. When it’s all done, I return the controller to Isiah, who reboots the PS4, itself, before launching *Farpoint*. My space becomes a lighter blue and fills with little opaque bits of Sony Dust for a minute or two. Isiah continues his rummaging for another peripheral as the title’s introduction begins to play.

Two rather poorly-animated astronauts are co-hosting a live broadcast from their craft, which is presented in a dramatization of a computer display. They’ve just met, but they’re both stacked with academia, co-massaging their knowledge, which I choose not to listen to. Out of view, Isiah unsuccessfully attempts to skip the whole thing before I’m allowed to become *virtual* again — this time, atop the animated body of another astronaut in a lone shuttle, approaching the mothership where it holds, next to a large, very-*Star Trek* “anomaly.” From Deep Space Nine, the two scientists continue to bicker over comms as I look around the cockpit. Looking backwards has already become a favorite habit of mine — I wonder where the shuttle’s bathroom is. For whatever reason, the back of my character’s neck was animated, though it can only be seen by looking rearwards and down, which distorts its shape into something truly terrifying.

A bunch of unrelated plot follows, leading me to end up on a foreign world, exiting my crashed escape pod. By now, Isiah has connected *The Gun*, but something about it isn’t quite right — my character holds it in a glitched, very uncomfortable-looking manner, and it’s suspected that a fix would require a restart, and therefore — a replay of the introductory cutscene — so I retire out of lack of patience.

If I were confidently reviewing PlayStation VR as a consumer purchase, I’d cite a quote of Isiah’s: “I couldn’t find the thing.” In addition to my first drone sighting, a few days ago in Colorado, this lost virtual virginity is not necessarily unwelcome — I feel as though I’ve acquired a platform to better ponder the dystopia to which these and their like industries add a certain comic spice. That said, I cannot imagine a reason to once again enter the digital realm — and *who cares*?

Please enjoy your new worlds, kids.

# Bandcamp: Streaming's Secret Savior

![Bandcamp Logo Banner](https://i.snap.as/toF3UAy.jpg)

## As the industry endeavors once again to reconcile the cultural and financial incentives of streaming digital music, one independent platform has wavered little from its 10-year-long mission to bring the business to the unsigned artist with elegance and integrity.

If you’ve ever thought to yourself *wow, Bandcamp has looked basically the same forever*, you were entirely correct – now for a tenth of the century, at least – and you’ll be hard-pressed to find another Silicon Valley technology company toting a venture-funded origin story with such casual, yet robust long-standing user relationships underneath an unwavering, bullshit-free commitment to their product. Even under the most ludicrous scrutiny, the company’s rudder is flawless and its course true. What at first glance you’d swear to be an unsolicited conclusion to an obscure examination could very reasonably be described as *cheesy*, *stubborn*, *dweebish*, *pious*, or just generally *boring*, indeed, yet the respective accuracy of each of these adjectives are no more than the byproducts of the very same operational ethics which we’ve suggested, requested, demanded, and begged the rest of the world’s computing capitol to re-adopt, enforce, or at least *ponder* for a beat. The volume of the masses’ exponentially-increasing attendance of late is only overcome by its hysterical shouting match, so let us pipe down for a while, now so that we may be precise as we dig deeper into the methodology which has finally led to a profitable, drama-free outlying technology organization without the need for a single drop of analogous sweat over its brand upkeep. By arranging the company in its infancy to so precisely and elementally align with the needs of its customers, the original troupe of Bandcamp Bums ensured profound and lasting simplicity in the single overarching priority for those in every single role behind the quiet perpetuation of Bandcamp dot com: **selling good** **music**. 

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.mixcloud.com/widget/iframe/?hide_cover=1&light=1&feed=%2Fdavod%2F%D1%82%D0%BD%CE%B1%D0%B8kf%CF%85l-f%CF%83%D1%8F-b%CE%B1%D0%B8dc%CE%B1%D0%BC%CF%81-2018-%D0%BCix%2F" frameborder="0" ></iframe>

The platform indiscriminately provides both individual artists and labels with a clean, cozy, charming, smartly-designed and technically competent storefront with a wide-open storage allocation, optimal search engine optimization and a widely-trusted point of sale experience in exchange for 15% of any sales that should come in – [significantly less](https://medium.com/@gloom303/a-year-ago-i-released-an-ep-on-spotify-itunes-and-bandcamp-this-is-what-i-l-earned-872925797930) than other channels; *half* what Apple Music will take. In examining Bandcamp’s history, its impact on independent music, and its viability as an alternative streaming service, we shall excavate the truth behind the derisive cynicism directed its way by the titans of the tech and music press. Over the course of this super link-laden journey, we’d consider the alarmingly hypocritical possibility that it’s been overlooked by mainstream conversations only because it has so long operated in the precise manner we claim is so hopelessly absent from its neighbors in its deliberate, principled, and innovative journey towards a transparent, progressive vision.

To catch our starting gun, we must first travel to *Face The Music 2016* in Melbourne – as far as one can possibly get from The Valley – alongside Bandcamp’s super-worldly Chief Curator, [Andrew Jervis](https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis) to observe his interview for a live audience.

> Bandcamp has always grown extremely organically. There’s never actually been any advertising that we’ve done; there’s never any advertising on the site, and there never will be. We haven’t really tooted our horn very hard.

In fact, just about everything from the shrewd idealism of those who beget its conception to the on-the-nose care in their person-to-person customer service is so adamantly inverse of the tech industry archetype which the global End User community at large are presently discovering at twice the speed of sound there should *at least* be some conspiratorializing going around. Where I come from, launching a desolate business to little mainstream success with persistence and dignified determination is (or should be) regarded as a telltale sign that one is running a front (according to the television, anyway,) but exploration of this plausibility yielded nothing in Bandcamp’s case, even after I took the risk of incrimination and begged a certain Boston-based future funk producer to accept my ginormous bribe and include *any* sort of pharmacological substance with his summer beat tape. He wouldn’t even send antihistamines.

As uncomfortably as it lands on the soul, no moniker describes Bandcamp more comprehensively than “an online record store.” As far as [Ethans](https://youtu.be/inzhStQJFQw) go, Bandcamp’s CEO and founders’ public attaché Ethan Diamond is as good as they come: it’s quite telling that he is the only Silicon Valley CEO who’s remained intellectually grounded enough with the rest of us in order to retain any skills in nuanced forms of verbal communication like… humor. The closest the company has ever come to promotion? His awkward, sub-20-minute [presentation](https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM) at the XOXO Festival 2014 offered an impressively succinct introduction to their greater mission considering the unmistakable agony in his body language. 

“We worked out of the public library for the first four years of the company's existence,” he admits. Impressively, Bandcamp was operated entirely as a “virtual company” until 2015.

Either Bandcamp just happens to be the single Silicon Valley company where the executives are unanimously so fucking fulfilled by their work without exception that they aren’t compelled to leave it long enough to stumble upon the inevitable coastal colleague with a connection to something like The Internet History Podcast, or technology journalism has definitively lost all reverence for actual innovation in favor of the [emotionally-charged](https://www.bcg.com/en-us/publications/2018/ideas-emotions-innovation-riding-amazement-cycle.aspx) Innovation Myth, now [relinquished almost entirely](https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17610348/twitter-elon-musk-display-name-change-lock-account-crypto-scams) to the narrative control of its own protagonists. Perhaps it was inevitable that Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, Mark Zuckerberg, and Jeff Bezos would become immortalized as “those who make things happen,” but our ability to quantify value as consumers tends to scurry rapidly away behind our backs when they’re turned by the constant distraction of these mostly inert figureheads. As their personalities have stolen the story, the people in industry with their hands on real product have all but completely disappeared from the frame, and all of the work remaining at the End User’s eye level was abandoned by aspiration long ago and replaced with the unfulfilling mechanism of A Quick Buck. Though now we are proceeding into a similar frame – only because our subject cares more about their mission than claiming recognition for it and might just be the first such company run by a cast who become sincerely defensive at the suggestion of a cash-out.

“Bandcamp’s philosophy has always been very different [from] a lot of the companies we’re surrounded by,” reflects Jervis. “We are not a ‘let’s-raise-money-and-burn-through-it’ type of company.”

I know that your mind has been trained by years of engagement with the digital media of a rapidly-globalizing, venture capital-obsessed society to block the passage of this sort of language across your conscious threshold at risk of life-threatening overexposure to the Medium Dialect and its churnalising neoliberal cyberchode scholars of the Personal Brand; I know you’ve read the exact same quote from how many entrepreneurs in how many worthless, masturbatory business magazine profiles, but I swear on my one-of-a-kind Estonian Hilary Duff pullout that Jervis speaks without irony or deception. how many fucking churnicles have abandoned you, but this time, it’s actually sincere.

# On The Web

Though Bandcamp was technically the first comprehensive library-modeled music streaming service in existence, the topical conversations between both technology and music journalists and industry executives flooding both podcast and news feeds at the moment orbiting the “Cord-Cutting” phenomena as it’s washed over television, cinema, and music are rooted in the same building blocks as the core technology behind the delivery of all of these conversations as well as their subjects, funny enough. As long as my subgeneration has known it, The Web has been a source of sound in some manifestation, but the example with the most perplexing history was also the first. Today, one of five tabs in the main menu of my iPhone’s native music app contains the text “Radio” beneath an “antenna with waves” graphic which opens a service once called [iTunes Radio](https://web.archive.org/web/20150608143103/https:/www.apple.com/itunes/itunes-radio/) that was absorbed into – and [restricted to subscribers of](https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/15/10777790/itunes-radio-apple-music-january-28) – Apple Music as of 2016, confusingly. However, both “iTunes Radio” and “Apple Music Radio(?)” – along with any and all audio streaming services (mentioned and not) – are fundamentally nothing more than different UX design interpretations of the “simple” practice of streaming an audio file, which made its debut at the turn of the century in the form of “Internet Radio.” Astonishingly, the protocol – still referred to by at least one person on Earth as “Webcasting,” no doubt – has survived nearly 20 years, and even the youngest of us have likely encountered it in unusual situations. 

Ironically, the [majority](http://radio.garden/) of Internet Radio broadcasts remaining on the air are nothing more than live duplicates of the traditional radio wave-bound products from the physical stations your car’s head unit receives. Even the current desktop version of iTunes maintains support for streaming “audio files over the internet,” though a glance at [Apple’s dated support page](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH19478?locale=en_US) for the process suggests it hasn’t crossed anybody’s mind for at least half of that history. In 1994, the publicly-funded radio network Voice of America became the “[First [radio] on the Internet](http://www.chriskern.net/history/voaFirstOnTheInternet.html)” when it [began](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!original/rec.radio.shortwave/2pQ9KUYmLqo/wqhhXS2k-lAJ) – after an introduction by Al Gore, no less – “offering digitized audio versions of selected newscasts and other program segments in 15 languages on its public internet server on Monday, Aug. 15,” according to former engineer Chris Kern. However – since we’re already this deep into internet history – a distinction must be established between streaming static files and streaming live audio. The first relies on pre-recorded audio files uploaded to a publicly-accessible server – in Kern’s original case, “via anonymous FTP and the Internet Gopher protocol,” which continues to be the elemental process behind every audio file streamed across the Web (including those on Bandcamp, Apple Music, Spotify, etc.) more or less because it ain’t broke. 

Semantically, “live” digital audio streaming in its aforementioned “purest” form is more or less exclusive to Internet Radio. Obscured aside from the traditional station simulcast, Web-only Internet Radio stations have their own of “[the Internet’s quiet success stories](https://www.thestar.com/business/2007/04/09/web_radio_may_stream_north_to_canada.html),” filled with quaint experiences and an endless cycle of death proclamations which continue to be disproven, anywise.

On June 27th, 1999, *The Seattle Times* ran [an especially worthwhile introduction to the concept](http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990627&slug=2968794) that likely represents the only major newspaper’s mention of SHOUTcast (the first and likely last name in DIY Web DJing) in the history of the printed word within a work of truly phenomenal tech reporting on Mark Mataassa’s part. From the past, one will find his chillingly spot-on foresight and well-considered observations are bestrewed with mind-boggling hilarity when they look.

> Dialing in to the Net through a 56 kilobit-per-second modem, as I am, this seems like a ridiculous waste - or at least misallocation - of resources.
>
> I'm using a $3,000 machine, tying up a phone line and seriously compromising my computing power for an experience that in sound quality, simplicity and dependability can't compare, truthfully, with the $9 Emerson clock radio an arm's length away.

> And yet Web radio is one of the hottest ideas going in the ever-hot world of Internet startups and acquisitions: In the past few months, America Online and Yahoo! each have purchased fast-growing Web music sites, rock-music trendsetters like Rolling Stone and MTV have gotten into the business, and technological improvements - from Microsoft's newest browser and Real Networks' newest player to the latest MP3 enhancements - are closing the quality and accessibility gaps.
>
> The combination of developments is not only changing how computers (and radios) are used, but offering a glimpse of a future when audience demographics are sliced ultra-thin - to the person - and everybody has the potential to be a radio broadcaster as well as listener.

I only have a few experiences with Internet Radio of my own, but they’re all rampantly more memorable than one would expect. The now in-stasis [NWIRE](https://twitter.com/nwireradio) project was by the most relevantly intriguing and [savvily-curated](https://soundcloud.com/themartmusic/nwire-radio-guest-mix-11-feb-2017) home for a diverse host of electronic musicians I’ve ever come across – it was my second default browser tab for most of 2017, when I’d even listen to the odd-hour broadcasts overseen by just the automated library-perusing bot for hours. On [episode 16 of *Drycast*](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc/a-a4674c), I recounted [the absurd tale](https://clyp.it/mps4yfyv) of my surprise morning encounter with a Norwegian station’s live broadcast from some European breakcore club, which was likely responsible for the most fun I’ve ever had working in retail.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=374449027/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=1571966121/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://ultrademon.bandcamp.com/album/seapunk">Seapunk by Ultrademon</a></iframe>

*Extratone*’s former Tech Editor is partial to a station called [Radio Swiss Jazz](http://www.radioswissjazz.ch/en), which appears to be thriving in comparison with most visible broadcasters, and unapologetically emits a bizarre amalgamation of tunes both chart-topping and Seriously Obscure across every conceivable genre (including Marching Music,) and continent of origin. Between every few charts, the brief commentary and station identification has provided our own private mystery: Was that one pre-recorded? This guy was on yesterday, but has since shed his accent? However, these tiny temporary mysteries are Internet Radio’s only remaining value for us, and I suspect the same is true for all but the most laggard laggards. For as long as I’ve been coherent enough to disseminate between much of anything, very few of its visible offerings have offered anything groundbreaking or fresh, perhaps out of negligence (one can very easily arrange leave a machine running SHOUTcast to shuffle through a given library of music and/or podcasts indefinitely,) frustration, or economic necessity.

Crucially, the truly *most* critical consequences and contributions provided by the pioneers of Internet Radio to our current digital streaming experience were centered within intellectual property legislation and advertising-supported business. Unfortunately, this juncture marks our complete departure from my wheelhouse, but thankfully, a few sacred accounts of one of technology’s foremost confusing clashes with the ill-equipped, technoilliterate monoliths of the American justice system do indeed remain. As early as 2002, the ineffable Doc Searls reported on a document authored by the Library of Congress’ Copyright Royalty Board called “[Determination of Royalty Rates and Terms for Ephemeral Recording and Webcasting Digital Performance of Sound Recordings](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/05/02/2016-09707/determination-of-royalty-rates-and-terms-for-ephemeral-recording-and-webcasting-digital-performance)” for *Linux Journal* in an encyclopedic breakdown of its implications ironically entitled “[Why Are So Many Internet Radio Stations Still on the Air](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6218)?” I would hope my comprehension is sufficient to declare that *this was no Cambridge Analytica*: only a few years subsequent the technology’s inception, operators within the Internet Radio business faced serious and immediate fines for their pre-enforcement distribution of copyrighted material stretching *four years* back – the severity of which the Doc suggested would “surely bankrupt many of the individual broadcasters that have been pioneering this marketplace for the longest time.”

> Unlike the commercial radio stations we hear on the old-fashioned airwaves, Internet radio stations' primary market relationship isn't with advertisers; it's with listeners. In many cases, the listeners are the primary source of revenue. This business model is similar to that of noncommercial (public) radio, only the market relationship is much more direct and efficient. Internet radio stations don't need to stop programming to hold marathon whine-fests begging listeners to call phone volunteers and pledge money to qualify for a mug or a t-shirt. Listeners simply click on a PayPal or an Amazon link, and after a few more clicks they've made a payment.

By [March, 2010](https://web.archive.org/web/20100330102643/http:/directory.google.com/Top/Arts/Music/Sound_Files/MP3/Streaming/Stations), just 374 stations were aggregated in Google’s Internet Radio Directory, and my own quick sample from its list unfortunately indicated that most are now silent, but SHOUTcast has yet to be abandoned after all this time and we can safely suppose the core architecture of the internet will remain recognizable enough to support it until after we’re all dead, rendering the necessary tools indefinitely ready and accessible should new projects in NWIRE’s vein come along (I know of no better fate I could wish upon the protocol.) From Internet Radio’s pioneer days, we must skip over a whole era to close in on Bandcamp’s origin in the very brightest peak of Web 2.0.

Again, we find ourselves in 2008 and nobody knows what an iPhone is, but the same classic rock-worshiping, upper-middle class, white collar Early Majority who first loved Internet Radio are now rapidly and delightedly distributing links to something called “Pandora dot com” between AOL and Hotmail inboxes. True luxury music reproduction comes in the form of Beats headphones motivated by a 320GB iPod Classic. Budding audiophiles and backpacker dweebs illegally torrent lossless .FLACs to play over their Christmas-gifted studio monitors with WinAmp, which they’ve set up to impeccably “scrobble” their history with every played track to their Last.fm profiles. Everybody else is still buying music from iTunes. (Those who cannot afford to buy the music they intend to add to their libraries transition to the music nerd classification as soon as they’ve sought out a way to obtain it free.) “Streaming” comes from subscription services like Rhapsody (now Napster,) which are [too buried in Digital Rights Management controversy](http://www.alphr.com/features/218559/the-online-music-rip-off) to feel sustainable. MySpace Music has just begun to fade away – next year, in “the Twitter era,” [SoundCloud will definitively replace it](https://www.wired.com/2009/07/soundcloud-threatens-myspace-as-music-destination-for-twitter-era/) as the go-to creator network – and Pandora’s immediate future is bright – they’ll make a big move on brand-new mobile streaming experience when they [launch their iPhone OS app](https://www.cnet.com/news/photos-hands-on-with-pandoras-internet-radio-iphone-app/) in July, but the limited performance of the handset’s EDGE network will render it a poor alternative to onsite .mp3s for years to come.

In January, to minimal acclaim, Oddpost’s Ethan Diamond launched Bandcamp, the startup with programmer friends Joe Holt, Shawn Grunberger, and Neal Tucker to be “a sortof WordPress for musicians” – an easily-created, well-designed landing page to showcase one’s digital music files. As Holt laments in [an interview with ](http://htmltimes.com/band-camp.php)*The HTML Times*, creating an online presence for your music had long been “a pain in the ass.” 

“You need to find a place to host it, you’ve gotta get the metadata right, it’s just hard. So we just decided we would do that hard part for musicians so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy.”

As an address to all of their shared complaints about the experience of online music distribution up to that point, [early Bandcamp](https://web.archive.org/web/20090716104620/http:/bandcamp.com) was an astounding piece of engineering. The quaint, unsurprisingly crate-digger-looking Ethan Diamond – who’s more or less remained the singular public face of the company since the very beginning – began a brand tradition of transparently music-nerdy correspondence with his [first post on the Bandcamp blog](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/09/16/hello-cleveland/), explaining the solutions the team had come up with in greater detail.

> We keep your music streaming and downloading quickly and reliably, whether it’s 3am on a Sunday, or the hour your new record drops and Pitchfork gives it a scathingly positive review. We make your tracks available in every format under the sun, so the audiophilic nerderati can have their FLAC and eat mp3 v2. We adorn your songs with all the right metadata, so they sail into iTunes with artwork, album, band and track names intact. We mutter the various incantations necessary to keep your site top-ranked in Google, so when your fans search for your hits, they find your music long before they find bonkersforlyrics.com or iMyFace. We give your fans easy ways to share your music with their friends, and we give you gorgeous tools that reveal exactly how your music is spreading, so you can fan the fire.

The launch garnered very little attention from tech or music publications of the time, but [Andy Baio’s interview with Diamond](https://waxy.org/2008/09/bandcamp_launch/) provides a substantial, technically in-depth picture of just how revolutionary and necessary it was. Most of what has continued to make Bandcamp such an essential tool was present at the very beginning: server-side stats and metadata (a unique architectural undertaking, no doubt,) track and album-oriented pagination, and a robust, easily-embedded Flash player.

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1739268?title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:auto;height:auto;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Study [Diamond’s first “screencast”](https://vimeo.com/1739268) alongside a [video tour of SoundCloud](https://vimeo.com/1857085) from the period and you’ll notice just how much more functional, future-proofed and *dignified* Bandcamp appeared in comparison. As apprehensive as I am to be caught arguing for minimalism over good design, it’s made perfect sense in the use case of *this one platform*, which knew *exactly* what it was from birth, along with what it would *always* be, apparently, which is such a bizarre reversal of the archetypes and the relentless common narrative we know from The Valley’s legends. Ethan first shows the consumer’s experience – none of which has changed after a whole decade aside from quality-specific track purchases – before delving into the artist-side UI, beginning with the statistics tool, which included playback and search insights to a depth that was (and still is) unheard of from a free service. Then, he demonstrates the publishing process from upload to playback: adding album art, setting a release date, and pricing its purchase. Aside from their removal of the old waveform visualizer (I couldn’t find any record of an announcement of this decision, official or otherwise,) Bandcamp has changed absolutely *nothing* of what’s shown in Diamond’s tutorial. In the next few months, they would add [custom page design](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/11/26/design-customization/), [email address capture](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2008/12/22/free-download-email-capture-thingy/), and [support for custom domains](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2009/01/23/custom-domains-custom-domains/). By October 2008, they’d made enough waves to be [picked up by ](https://www.cnet.com/news/bandcamp-for-cleaner-music-sites/)*CNET*, for whatever that was worth. Apparently, [Facebook Music](https://venturebeat.com/2008/10/22/facebook-music-is-getting-its-act-together/) was a legitimate property as well, but I do not remember anything about it at all—pondering an alternate reality in which *The* Social Network became the dominant online music streaming platform leads to a bizarre comparison of Neil Diamond and Mark Zuckerberg which I can’t imagine being altogether productive. Suffice it to say, the two founders’ visions differ greatly.

# Musicblogocide

Contextually, it’s also important that we dwell for a moment on the legal and financial hullabaloo surrounding music sales during Bandcamp’s first formative years, and the federal government’s losing battle to interpret, enforce, or replace intellectual property law for the information age. As the Web had grown exponentially more capable and accessible as a means of audio file distribution, it had become absolutely saturated with blatantly DRM-circumventing .mp3s and .wavs. For years, the quickest way to follow up on a *check it out* sort of music recommendation was simply to search Google for its track name followed by “.mp3.” If the first go didn’t yield success, even the most rudimentary application of cryptography – like substituting some variation of “nsilmtic.rar” to find a download for Nas’ *Illmatic*, for instance – was a sure bet for one’s second try, which would often return several copies just laying around Google-indexed WordPress media libraries, though results hosted on Mediafire were a preferable alternative. This was the establishment into which my first adolescent digital music discoveries were borned, and I’m still convinced that 99% of us participants were completely without malice. I’d argue heartily that music’s brief escape from the tireless grip of the record industry as its only medium stumbled into digital form would be clearly shown to have a net gain for the whole of American recording artists if you could measure and plot it, including the past, present, and future use of peer-to-peer sharing.

2010 would prove to be The Year of Reckoning for the fraction of DRM-violating traffic on the *visible* Web, at least. Though it’d be virtually impossible to quantify, is it only reasonable to assume that many siteowners made some real money from the ad impressions that directly resulted from their unauthorized hosting and Mediafire-embedding, but let’s consider how minuscule even the most outrageously liberal overestimate would be, side-by-side with the billions in additional revenue YouTube has raked in from the same music since assuming their place as the de facto platform for quickly summoning just about any work of audio that’s ever taken digital form. It was in February of that year that Blogger (another Google property) [deleted six music blogs](https://blogger.googleblog.com/2010/02/quick-note-about-music-blog-removals.html) from its platform in response to complaints about allegedly DMCA-violating .mp3s. *The Registry* [insisted](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/02/11/google_musicblogocide_2010/) the collective finger be pointed at the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, itself. 

“It would seem the music bloggers aren't versed in the ways of DMCA claims and counterclaims. But you can't blame Google for that,” they concluded, after one of the blog’s founders expressed some of the most personally-dramatic words mine empathy has yet faced as [quoted in The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/11/google-deletes-music-blogs).

“It's just sad because we were documenting young people's music from all around the globe. For a lot of people, it was music they wouldn't have been able to discover elsewhere.”

In hindsight, “blame” is an even more useless avenue of one’s attention than usual, especially when one party (Google) was 100% exempt from any consequences all along. The alarming takeaway is not the DMCA’s deftness, but that **Google had the freedom to wait for a parallel business incentive before deciding the law applied to them**.

Frankly, we should all have realized long ago just how fucking futile it is to attempt to control any file traffic. Every desktop-class browser ships with the capability to capture any streamable media on the Web with a handful of keystrokes – it’d take a maximum of 20 minutes to bestow upon even the most casual user the knowledge they’d need to keep every single track, YouTube video, and Twitch stream they’d ever watch, 100% legally without a single third-party service/extension interaction, but the crucial question remains to what end, exactly? It’s easy, but it’s not exactly a fun way to spend an afternoon. The only two rationales that’d justify capturing streamed Web files at scale are 1) the totally bonkers inclination that any given property/ies is likely to disappear from the entire World Wide Web, ever or 2) the increasingly rarefying expectation of prolonged time away from internet access. 

As Bandcamp has stood so obdurately still, the mainstream music streaming sphere has expanded titanically around it as if enveloping the Indie platform in a surrealist timelapse within the eye of a ruinous tech industry cyclone, which would explosively expand the market into a ghoulish, filthy monstrosity beyond anything we’d recognize from the rule of the WinAmp Hipster, long ago. **Today, the coolest and most rabid daily music listeners I know all have Spotify memberships**, joining [70 million others](https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/4/16850742/spotify-subscriber-count-70-million-users) globally as of January. For most, it’s how they prefer to swaddle their lives in a constant soundtrack – at work, in the car, at school, then at home on the television. For many, it’s how they “explore” new music outside of peer and social recommendations... or, that’s how the narrative was supposed to go, anyway. Those folks I know who actually create music, however, are rarely seen using Spotify—even after they’ve endured untold horrors in order to publish their own music there—because the real story of its track record as a place to “Discover” new artists, genres, or sounds is completely abysmal. When 2017’s streaming data began coming in this past January, a popular feature by [Galaxie 500](http://galaxie500.bandcamp.com/)’s Damon Krukowski was run by the definitively terminal music magazine of broad notoriety—*Pitchfork*—entitled “[How to Be a Responsible Music Fan in the Age of Streaming](https://pitchfork.com/features/oped/how-to-be-a-responsible-music-fan-in-the-age-of-streaming/),” which he began by citing some very alarming statistics.

“**More than 99 percent of audio streaming is of the top 10 percent most-streamed tracks** [on Spotify.] Which means less than 1 percent of streams account for all other music.” 

Why? A brazen disregard for necessary meta information, for one.

“Look now at how badly their applications already serve entire genres of less popular music. Spotify lists recordings by song title, album title, or featured artist name. But that information is so limited it leaves out even the other performers on a recording, a crucial aspect to classical and jazz.”

![Spotify-Pitfork](https://i.snap.as/96z3H8C.png)

Alarming for those of us who intend to create or consume any music separate the Top 40, anyway, which one should feel justified expecting from most people, most of the time. Last month, The Carters released an album on which [even Beyoncé](https://www.bustle.com/p/when-will-everything-is-love-be-on-spotify-beyonce-jay-z-fans-may-have-to-wait-to-stream-the-surprise-album-update-9426616) identified the problematic service by name. “Patiently waiting for my demise ‘cause my success can’t be quantified,” she rapped, “if I gave two fucks about streaming numbers woulda put Lemonade up on Spotify." The unfortunate issue with this single denouncement of the industry’s current direction is that its source is adamantly guaranteed a place for her work within Spotify’s top 10 percent for the rest of her career’s lifetime (and probably far beyond.)

[I could now take the time to complain that she’s also entirely abandoned the city [she owes for her career’s creation](https://youtu.be/iiMlq8frlqw) in its darkest hour, but let’s just plan on coming back to the subject at a later date, when we’ll be sure to touch on how terribly Drake also treats Houston (and women.)]

Unsurprisingly, the apathy is far from mutual. From the Swedish company’s perspective, the digits themselves should’ve been dearly and universally beloved from the beginning, and their exponentially ballooning hubris became so inflated by 2014 that they [launched a WordPress blog](https://insights.spotify.com/us/about-spotify-insights/) dedicated entirely to promoting and discussing their data called [*Spotify Insights*](https://insights.spotify.com/), proclaiming themselves—naturally—to be “the world’s favorite streaming service,” [championing](https://insights.spotify.com/us/2017/11/02/listening-diversity-spotify/) the growing diversity in their demographics. Though Beyoncé is mentioned only twice upon a [search of its archive](https://insights.spotify.com/us/?s=beyonce) as it stands today, it’s with fanfare: “[10 Female Artists Women Listen To The Most on Spotify](https://insights.spotify.com/us/2015/03/06/10-female-artists-women-listen-to-the-most/)” declared her the third most popular female artist among women, globally, and “Single Ladies” the number one female-streamed track in the world (assuming I’m interpreting its language correctly.)

We’ve established that Spotify has comfortably planted itself at the polar opposite end of the business spectrum from Bandcamp, yet for the sake of an oblivious adjudicating layman’s understanding, you’d have your work cut out for you explaining the difference between them: both are online marketplaces with gigantic libraries of digital music which a listener can browse, download locally, or stream from using Web browser or the mobile applications offered by each, respectively—and they can do from just about anywhere, for as much or as little as they wish. And—as the music industry and its satellites shall always remain for the rest of humanity’s reign—both are overwhelmingly associated with young people. There, the crucial divide should probably ring a bell—it’s been a constant between cultural generations for as long as culture, itself has existed.

There are those among us who’s adolescent adoration of music is still completely valid as a very powerful component of hormonal development, yet doomed to quickly sizzle into casual listening or worse by the time our post-secondary Senior year rolls around. And then, there are those on whom the curiosity clings devotedly on: the cool high school punk band-forming types our culture loves to romanticize, who’ll inevitably end up bald and bespeckled with a pre-dawn community radio block. These Musicians, Crate-Diggers, and capital-A Audiophiles have historically overlapped in synonymous functions across a love triangle of dweebish intolerability, though it’s become especially easy as of late to forget that DIY recording is by no means a recent development—its financial and technical barrier-to-entry has simply plummeted thanks to the developmental progression of Digital Audio Workstations and a growing industry of consumer-oriented audio equipment. For succinct insight into this dynamic, let’s refer to the pre-dialogue context in [Chuck Klosterman’s *GQ* interview](https://www.gq.com/story/jimmy-page-led-zeppelin-men-of-the-year-klosterman) with “the second- or the third-best rock guitarist of all time”—*Zinc Blimp* legend Jumbo Page.

> The only thing Page really wants to talk about [is] the sound of the music, and how that sound was achieved. He can talk about microphone placement for a very, very long time. Are you interested in having a detailed conversation about how the glue used with magnetic audiotape was altered in the late 1970s, subsequently leading to the disintegration of countless master tapes? If so, locate Jimmy Page. If a different musician obsessed over technological details with this level of exacting specificity, he would likely be classified as a “nerd," as that has become a strange kind of compliment in the Internet age. People actually want to be seen as nerds. But that designation does not apply here. Jimmy Page does not seem remotely nerdy.

Bandcamp’s core architecture was handbuilt from the beginning to handle the “hard part” for creators “so that they didn’t have to be so nerdy,” which it, alone pioneered on the Web, becoming the best metadata management utility for all time, but also committing to a traditional interpretation of music mediums that can feel old fashioned in 2018. Despite having been around for a directly comparable length of time, SoundCloud has maintained its relevance among friends in my network as the more socially-focused platform for keeping up with work from their peers thanks in large part to its exclusive, timestamp-oriented comment function, which allows for ultra-specific shortform feedback between fellow creators and fans. This is how the company has chosen to grow its community, which has lent especially to its strength in the most “nerdy” independent scenes: hip-hop and electronic music. The experience is busy by design and the divide between listener and creator is next to non-existent—by now, the difference is universally irrelevant. External sharing has also become a major strength since the inception of SoundCloud’s Web audio player, which was unlike any other embeddable we’d ever seen at the time. Over the years, it’s become the most universally-supported means of embedding a track or playlist elsewhere, though the space has quite recently began blooming with a few much slimmer Open Web offshoots like Vocaroo, Clyp, and Instaudio.

While I can casually throw these names around for you in the same sized font, the gulfs between the properties they denote are completely inexpressible in words. Because Spotify went public in Q1 of this year, they released [their first earnings report](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180502006667/en/) in April: 170 million active monthly users, $1.33 billion in total quarterly revenue, and $5.7-$6.2 billion in expected total revenue for 2018. I’ll spare you the entire Forbes piece it would require to comprehensively demonstrate just how cavernous of a disparity canyon the industry represents. Early projects like Pandora were docile, ad-free, and sincerely curious about the curatorial potential of music streaming services – *let’s use this cool new tech to play **music** for **anybody** with a Web browser if only because it’ll be a blast* – yet in that sense, they’ve all failed entirely. All except Bandcamp, anyway.

“We started as a service to help artists sell their music and merchandise directly to their fans, but then as the site grew—it’s now at about 12 million tracks and 1.5 million albums [as of 2014]—we evolved into also being a destination for music Discovery,” he explains, partially anticipating the foot-to-the-floor transition to streaming which has indeed shook the industry the hell up over the years since. The company's solution is minimal, elemental, yet uniquely alternative as only theirs could be: an idealized **digital interpretation of a music collection**, which had actually launched a year before XOXO as part of “[Bandcamp for Fans](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/01/10/bandcamp-for-fans/).” That release notably introduced the ability to “follow” both artist and fan accounts, the now-iconic “supported-by” section on release pages showing customers’ avatars and optional comments, and public wishlists. “I think it’s great to use a streaming service for music Discovery—they can be really really good for that,” Diamond [concedes](https://youtu.be/MaUkS-lr-ZM?t=16m11s), before reiterating one of the several variations of Bandcamp’s founding premise that composes his core argument: “if you actually care about music, and you care about the people who make it, and you want them to keep making it, the best way to do that is to buy directly from them, or to use services that allow you to directly support them.”

Instead of the “firehose”-like experience of a contemporary activity feed, “you’ve got a collection of albums and tracks that people were passionate enough to spend money on.” For my personal use, Ethan lit up a long-dormant incandescent bulb in my skull. My use of Bandcamp had long been to purchase and download music files, only—never to stream it—and there’s been good reason for this. While Bandcamp has formally supported playback on iPhone and iPad in-browser since [July 2010](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2010/07/14/now-streaming-on-the-ipad-iphone/), actually using it for any substantial amount of playback has always been a souring endeavor. Considering that it’s persisted *to this day*, we must concede that it is part of an intentional design rather than just an irritating flaw: **multitasking between apps or even browser tabs will prevent continuous playback of an album**, as will locking the device. In order to move from track to track fluidly, one must keep the page with the in-use Bandcamp player front and center. For three years, this was the only way to stream Bandcamp on mobile, but such capability was far from reliably expected by even the earliest adopters, then—3G data networks were worse than you remember, anyway—and then in 2013, [the Bandcamp app was launched](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/10/25/its-over/) on iOS and Android, providing a sufficient fix in my book at the time. (I’d rather any externally-embedded players I may engage with in an album review or artist profile be limited to a single track, anyway.) However, the app itself remained quite mediocre for years, which was a tangible disappointment given how revolutionary their desktop experience had been when the company launched,but not necessarily a substantial deterrent to the sort of user they were attracting.

I made a point to spend *a lot* of time engaging with Bandcamp’s service as much as possible – naturally, this included a trip back through [my neglected, digitally dusty Collection](http://bandcamp.com/davidblue), which proved a way more emotionally provocative experience than I anticipated. Ethan’s simple truth didn’t really sink in until I realized that this list is made up exclusively of my *real favorites*, and there’s not a single track that is not inextricably and intoxicatingly tied to a specific era(s) of my life (yes, even that one Blank Banshee album... I was 18, okay?) It’s absurdly powerful—not something I could engage with for any extended time without becoming saturated with nostalgic gut stuff. (Listen for my upcoming special celebratory episode of [Extratone Radio](http://extratone.com/radio) to hear the best music I’ve found through Bandcamp.) It hadn’t occurred to me that I would retain ownership and streaming rights to all music I’ve purchased—including for a $0.00 sum, as I did for at least half of the works you see—even after an artist chose to delete or hide it on their own page. (Though they are not retained in my public collection, of course.)

# The Discovery Debacle

Pursuing an objective definition of “music Discovery” might appear foolish – an individual’s music taste is perhaps the most broadly angst-steeped realms of overwhelming subjectivity in modern American culture, after all – but its the pungent poignancy of our fundamental human relationship with sound, itself which makes the history of Discovery’s digitization so important (and fascinating.) If I were to ask you what you believe should be the single most important function that must be reliably performed by any “music Discovery” device – whether it be an application, Web service, magazine or even a crate-digging habit – the single factor which would render whole vague concept inert, irrelevant, and/or completely destroyed, how would you answer? How would you interpret the question? 

It’s important we do well to take a considerable moment to cultivate a special wariness of the eggshells beneath our feet in this arena. Debatably at least a minim more than one’s taste in film, Americans from Generation X on forward until the end of time (I suspect) will hold “their” music as perhaps the most integral support upon which their identities are built throughout every stage of their lives. The intense sensation of ownership that propels this phenomenon within our culture leaves an especially sensitive passage ahead of us.

As a wide-eyed teenager and infantile audio producer, I explored the idea of anti-music in my own entirely Bandcamp-supported project while I searched – aided tremendously by my expert best friend – for the edgiest, least sensical sounds and scenes on which to publicly attach on my identity in an opposing of “Discovery’s” extremes with fandom: **an obsessive, entirely-detached last-ditch skirmish between the cultural reality and my delusional pubescent need to be unique**. This process appears to be a universal requisite in modern youth in one form or another, but it’s important now that I emphasize this confession: I was an especially ostentatious little backpacker fuck, but I’ve continued to find my shame well worth achieving a specific balance for music’s purpose in my life, and I’d anecdotally endorse its potential to relieve cognitive dissonance at great scale. There’s only so much fun to be had blasting breakcore cassettes at deafening, distorted volumes solely to bewilder rural overnight convenience store clerks on their smoke breaks in the wee hours or the bruteforce seizure of the speakers’ Bluetooth connection at a frat party just to play harsh noise or anime-sampling Hardstyle while demonically shrieking – eyes rolled back – and lighting various parts of oneself ablaze before one realizes that 1) it’s they who end up looking like the idiots for aggressively breaching a group’s fun with inappropriate tunes (yes, no matter how interesting, rare, or underrated they may be, Chadley;) 2) by ferally manifesting, you’ve deligitimized yourself, which 3) can seriously damage any future attempts to accomplish **the fundamental drive to share the gospel of music’s variety** out of your own rubish frustration with the differences between you.

The real, sweetest truth is that **100% of all music has value potential** because of the medium’s broad influence on the human psyche. Pop music is amazing right now; the signature trap sound we devalued with Datpiff jokes made us all look like fools when it unconsciously transcended our “irony” and burrowed its own huge partition in our sincere hearts. After my pitiful attempt to reject and distance myself from my own rural roots by scoffing at country music for years, I’ve made a beautiful peace with the childhood memories and the historic excellence of Shania Twain and The Dixie Chicks in their mastery of both wholesome joy and crippling nostalgia (I’ve even cried to Taylor Swift.) Yes, it’s been entirely reasonable all along to enjoy the straightforwardly slothen pleasure in belching “Sweet Home Alabama” pounding cheap pissbeer on a foul pontoon boat on the Lake of the Ozarks, leaving my penultimate irony to confess that I’ve only found true and serene identity through music after learning how to stop insisting so violently upon the worldly, one-of-a-kind superiority of my “taste.”

That said, it’s still bewildering how content we are to abruptly abandon the substance music had to our teenage selves out of misconstrued justifications for our classic fainéance – actively choosing to subject our public ambiance to thousands of replays of “the best” records in favor of dipping even the most cowardly toe into unfamiliar waters, even when the opportunity cost is inherently halved – only to then have the audacity to evangelize our dilapidated conceptions of “good music” to our children as we demonize the music of their generation, depriving them of a very essential rite of their cognitive development. **I can think of little more reductive, repugnant, reckless, or racist crusades as a model figure than indoctrinating your child with an inherent distaste for their own culture**, and nothing more deeply alarming to hear from the mouth of someone born in the 21st century than shit like “Queen was better than any rapper will ever be,” or “real musicianship will die forever with Eric Clapton.” It’s unfair and unnatural: imagine if your high school classmates had consistently turned up their scrunched nose at the living whole of rock & roll, declaring Scott Joplin to be the last musician they could stand.

Consider if the industry-wide customer experience standard for the musical ambiance in 1970s American eating and drinking establishments was entirely comprised of works by John Phillip Souza, and the most prevalent cultural revolution manifested itself something like the following: In countless popular films set in the time (and the stories told today by your parents of their youths that informs them,) a group of popular high school boys – generally three longtime childhood friends and a single addition from the previous summer with an Army Dad and a moderate bad boy aura that’s made him one of the school’s notoriously attractive students and the somewhat-abusive leader in the pack. After spending some time trying to convince the other three (the crucial moment for his case being the bad kid’s rare moment of sincerity trope) of its guaranteed social, sexual and financial ROI, they seal their agreement to start a band with a four-way saliva slap. Imagine if in the progression of this exhausted old tale, it remained entirely classic (and boring) when it faded to a “THREE MONTHS LATER...” ceiling shot of the four the in full, gleaming, performance-spec get-up of the presidential marching band in their garage, and it was revealed that they’d they practiced “The Star Spangled Banner” every night just to make the girls swoon in the film’s resolution with an encore of “America the Beautiful” at an unsanctioned (and very patriotic!) house party.

Suffice it to say that it’s absolutely fucking bonkers how often I encounter “Sweet Home Alabama” (and other tunes I’ve already heard hundreds of times throughout the first third of my existence, conservatively) dripping down from the overhead speakers in all manner of big retail stores, where it’s inappropriate and unwelcome. Even from the generous assumption that every single one of them is an objective masterwork of composition, the amount of affection the American music listening audience has for the same 500 singles is on par with our rampant gun violence in terms of our unanimous tolerance for ridiculously illogical habits. I’ve been sitting in a cute, moderately trendy coffee shop on the corner of the major avenue of access to my cute, moderately trendy Portland neighborhood for an hour now, and I’ve recognized every single one of the tracks played just a bit too loudly on the stereo. I’ve been sick of them all since Middle School. That one Bow Bow Chicka Chicka thing… How very charming. 

“*The 70s, the 80s… the one-hit wonder channel!”* 

Contrary to the popular hipster narrative we’ve just defeated, it’s not the popularity of the lineup that makes these experiences so distasteful, but their *regularity*. It doesn’t take a doctor of psychology to observe that tireless exposure to any given work of art inevitably erodes its value, yet we continue to expend resources saturating most mundane spaces in our society with an unyielding regurgitation of the same brackish pop culture symbols as if we’re *trying* to either induce a canonical vomit, intentionally obliterate the Yelp! reviews for a distant future museum’s “North America Enters the 21st Century” exhibit, or *both*. After failing my best attempts to elaborate with historical analogy citing a past event, I’m afraid we must pivot to a science fiction-esque nanonarrative containing obnoxiously speculative hypotheticals, instead.

**Imagine**: It’s 2036 – four years after we found out we are not alone in the universe when a significantly more advanced civilization makes formal first contact with humanity by sending a party of diplomats, anthropologists, and explorers (who were actually getting ready to go in 2016 before getting word of the Trump presidency and deciding we weren’t quite ready just yet) who land their space egg right in front of the United Nations’ New York City headquarters and expressing something to the tune of *hey so um… we noticed you guys moved in and we just wanted to stop by and say hi*, entirely altering humanity’s self-perception and future trajectory (see: works by Gene Roddenberry) yadda yadda. The visitors expressed a wish to begin a cultural exchange project with us, and it’s just now coming to fruition… I have only moments ago made history in the eyes of the entire world when I walked through the front door of a Target store in suburban New Jersey leading a hovering hyper-intelligent silicon-based sphere of agender mist (roughly comparative to a basketball in size,) who’s already both impressing and shaming me tremendously as we move by the in-store Starbucks. From above us, Semisonic’s “Closing Time” is belched upon my life’s proudest moment and my guest requests we pause to discuss it, to my profound horror.

“The sound from the reproduction devices embedded above us...” the android translator trails off for a moment. “It is the same noise that was distantly reproduced 51 hours ago in ‘Miami’ as I conversed with Ambassador Phillip Defranco about ‘the setting sun’ on the ‘beach,’ coming from a small open air structure which he defined as ‘a surf shop,’ which was occupied by a young male who appeared to be moderately agitated, moving about in jagged strides as he wildly smacked the foundational surface with ‘a broom.’ The Ambassador explained the youth was likely nearing the end of his allotted period of daily occupational labor.”

Blood is flooding my cheeks as I listen with a building dread to the robot’s interpretation, awash with all manner of embarrassment for my species. 

“Is the purpose of this noise reproduction of a logistical nature, or is it perhaps a common ritual within business and/or working class culture?”

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2309125545/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=2334991176/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://ripswirl.bandcamp.com/album/possessed">Possessed by RIP Swirl</a></iframe>

Now, it’s your turn to be the human representative in this pico science fiction: you’re now obligated to confirm the alien anthropologist’s hypothesis and explain that “Closing Time” is but one piece of recorded music among billions of diverse expressive works across millennia. You must reverently describe how the “universal language” of math within melodious composition has long been a hefty buzzword in the pop culture conversations about interstellar communication and our longtime search for extraterrestrial intelligence from the future-thrilled 90s—S.E.T.I.’s glory days – when we felt pretty damned good about space. The historic launch of the United Nations’ “greetings on behalf of the people of our planet” etched into [The Golden Record](https://www.npr.org/2017/09/30/554489944/the-voyager-golden-record-finally-finds-an-earthly-audience) aboard *Voyager I* and Jodie Foster’s novel portrayal of a S.E.T.I. scientist in the iconic Carl Sagan-sourced 1997 science fiction drama *Contact* are among the globally-celebrated Best Hits of humanism (not to mention the organization listed on your paystubs,) and they weigh a billion tons on you, now—in the most significant moment of your entire life, bar none – as you explain on behalf of your species to **real** extraterrestrial intelligence the reality of how negligent it is actually is of the culture the Record claimed to treasure. The worst part, though? The entire experience is accompanied by a nasal-as-hell Semisonic soundtrack.

Aren’t you *frustrated*? You should be, but it’s not over yet: inevitably, your round fictional companion of note is going to follow up their query with some seriously burning meat.

“Just a half-generation ago, your utopian dream of a globally-connected world – in which everyone would be empowered to saturate and culture themselves with new ideas and forms of expression – was the defining aspiration of your society, and yet you’ve definitively achieved Total Connectivity, now, and caused the overwhelmingly opposite result: you’re all intolerable shitheads who every passing solar orbit become less and less capable of anything but regurgitation of the same foul bullshit. Y’all fucking wack. I’m out. ”

And there, that filthy little ball would have us all. Friends, colleagues, human siblings of mine, **it’s long-past time we expect better from ourselves** as music citizens of the world. Even the longest living of us are endowed with very little opportunity to absorb anything more than an infinitesimal fraction of all there is to experience, and we’ve all been carelessly and embarrassingly chucking it to the weeds. If it this all seems excessive, there’s no need to feel attacked, but for Pete’s sake… please stop claiming you “like music” because it’s misleadingly inaccurate and I’ll promise never to use the phrase “music citizens of the world” again, in exchange.

# Distribution & Curation

**You, your friends, and I are missing out on way too much cool shit** and we’re going to continue addressing possible causes and solutions to this ongoing catastrophe without asking for a single moved finger on your part because we are fucking saints. Let’s come back to ground and consider a casual real-world use case for a streaming service which I’ve observed.

*It’s just after 1PM on an especially beautiful Summer day in 2018, and you’ve decided with your two best friends that an impromptu hot dog barbecue in your little apartment’s parking lot would be a great way to spend the afternoon. You get on Facebook Messenger – no time to bother with the formality of creating an event – and begin to bother your group of art school friends. In a few hours, you’ve set up chairs in a circle around the borrowed fire pit, gathered meat tubes, marshmallows, and beer, and your guests have begun to arrive. The next step: retrieve your cordless Bluetooth speaker from inside to place it atop a log nearest the scene, re-pair it with your smartphone, and ___?*

Let’s acknowledge that music has incredibly diverse purposes of value in human life—*of course* I realize this—and ultimately, nobody can dictate those fulfilled for another individual by any given track, album, artist, or genre across time and setting. Even splittercore-obsessed serial killers and body modding cybergrind disciples are doomed: inevitably, they will one day let their guard down and find themselves singing along with “Goodbye Earl” on the radio way off key, smiling like a doofus. Even if one hates humanity, they will eventually be forced to acknowledge that The Dixie Chicks came very close to its penultimate manifestation.

I understand that it’s not *always* time for something new for everyone, but you’re missing out on music’s most worthwhile function by far if you never seek anything fresh, and—if you still find yourself unwilling to bother, even—carrying around even the slightest bit of anecdotal knowledge about *what’s going on* in music with you can be invaluably culturing to your image when socializing with youths and alien intelligences, alike. There is a spectrum of enthusiasm (or pretentiousness, depending on one’s own subjectives) for music that is far more culturally consequential than the practice of partaking and/or patroning any other artform. Settle comfortably on any point – extreme or not – and you’re at serious risk of being uncool. Nobody wants Anthony Fantano showing up to their party, but if you live too long confusing the Beach Boys with the Beatles – as I have – folks start to behave as if there’s something wrong with you. If it helps, let’s suppose this to be the *real* reason behind my need to discuss Bandcamp – perhaps its relative lack of aged or worshiped-at-scale work justifies it all.

By this nature, its effort is designed to bracket the enthusiast as wholly as possible, but the value most in need of its experience has become its comparatively extravagant hospitality for the dabbler. The “[Discoverinator](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/07/behold-the-glory-of-the-discoverinator/)” (I would’ve voted for calling it “Genre-Fucker”) is simply *the* most ingenious tool available anywhere to filter music by genre, subgenre, location, and medium. Or at least... It’s too gorgeous not to be. Thanks to its recent visual redesign, I don’t even care if it’s useful—it’s just a beautiful thing to play with on both the Web and the iOS app (though I’d bet they were each crafted separately.)

<iframe width="auto" height="auto" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SOaEAR9Da70?controls=0" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Front and center on the homepage is the [Bandcamp Daily](http://daily.bandcamp.com/) – a showcase of features, lists, albums of the day, and artist interviews from various staff and guest contributors which I’d most certainly judge befit of a standalone publication – and the [*Bandcamp Weekly*](https://bandcamp.com/?show) – an extraordinarily-produced podcast like no other with special mixes, guest appearances, and commentary which the company’s [Chief Curator Andrew Jervis](https://bandcamp.com/andrewjervis) has been honing [since 2013](http://bandcamp.com/?show=1) over 289 episodes as of [this morning](http://bandcamp.com/?show=289). Its player functions both in-browser and on the iOS app unlike any I’ve ever seen, with a list of embedded tracks that pop out when they’re actually spinning on the show so that you can engage further with them, if you wish. It’s difficult to describe, but it feels visually like you’re listening to a playlist in Bandcamp’s normal player, except tracks are intermixed and faded between one another beneath the host’s commentary, so the audio itself must be pre-rendered. Regardless, it’s nearly as extraordinary an achievement in Web design as the program itself is in curatorial music broadcasting. I’m no addict to the genre, but I have yet to Discover another similar product which I can binge episode after episode for hours without becoming bored or irritated as I can the *Bandcamp Weekly*’s.

To fill in the parking lot party blank with a single streaming solution for the sake of our young, art school-attending, likely more musically-literate than average summer barbecue guests—how viable is Bandcamp? Truthfully, it’s only slightly more suited now than it was in its earliest infancy for obediently filling a space with ambiance. We could ponder whether or not its design discourages absentminded playback only consequently, or perhaps condescendingly from the high, white tower of hipster elitism on which you’ll occasionally hear it accused of perching, but UX design is *the* most ridiculous sphere within which to intenspeculate in lieu of verification (gazing at you with the timeless grace of a thousand moons, *Medium,*) so lets hold off to seek out an interview with a Bandcamp representative.

SoundCloud would be a bit closer to the mark—it can be configured to simply *keep going* after you’ve finished a track, regardless of where you may be within the interface (excluding the embedded player, of course)—but it’d be much safer to spend the smidgen of extra time required to find a manmade playlist. Letting it loose will quickly land you on some seriously dubious (and probably embarrassing) nerd shit. As I understand it, YouTube has long been the go-to houseparty music player because of its universality, Chromecast support, and (obviously) visual component for accompanying music videos, so its new, ad-free [YouTube Music service](https://djmag.com/content/youtube-launches-youtube-music-and-youtube-premium-streaming-services) has a lot of potential, in theory, but we’re *outside* in this scenario and our smartphone is our only playback device.

Startlingly, the Web’s given best answer to this situation is still Spotify in all of its culture-diluting gluttony. *Internet radio*? Yikes. You can still find a gem of a stream every once in a while, but they’re usually unreliable and probably abandoned, so the catalog won’t last you more than a few hours before you’ll start to hear repeats. You could search out the internet stream of your favorite radio station—a *student* radio station, even—but those offering the most entertaining programming are unlikely to have a suitable playlist on a summer afternoon. So—forgetting its overwhelming financial funneling toward its top 10% and everything else for a moment—why not just give up the pretense and use Spotify? Again, for most of my friends, it works just fine to play Cat Stevens, Run DMC, Gorillaz or The Rolling Stones, but I have yet to figure out a combination of keywords to keep it on target within even the most rudimentary parameters. Such ill-restraint becomes especially dire—necessary, really—when I queue up “Cannibal Ox Radio” for the office and R Kelly ends up playing, 20 minutes in. Using personally-targeted artist bans is probably too subjective to ask of such a service in the spotlight, but **how about an option to filter out white rappers**? (I hope you didn’t blink because that’s by far my best contribution in tech writing yet.)

The truth is, I’d probably end up calling upon Apple Music as I’ve been an on-and-off subscriber since its release, but have yet to meet a single fellow user. The girth of its catalog is [reportedly still nearly ](https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/)[25% larger](https://9to5mac.com/2018/05/06/apple-music-vs-spotify/), its UI is significantly more cohesively integrated with iOS (which hasn’t always been a given from Apple with its music software, mind you,) yet it costs me precisely the same $9.99 a month as Spotify Premium would. If I *did* know somebody else who used it, they’d be able to see [my public profile](http://bit.ly/dbapple) including my playlists and activity, just as my followers on Spotify can, and I can create “Stations” for artists that function similarly to Spotify’s endless adaptive playlists, but—crucially, for myself—after the app’s redesign for iOS 10, the integration of Apple Music music with my own iTunes library is completely seamless. With unlimited data, I’ve selected the option to refrain from storing music locally, which further diminishes the distinction between “my” music and the music I’ve paid for the rights to stream. Fundamentally, the end result is that I pay ten bucks a month for “ownership” of *all* the music on iTunes proper.

While I might personally play *Bandcamp Weekly* episodes in such a context and gladly accept whatever results I’d get, I’d only do so acknowledging the subsequently increased risk of some vest-wearing fuck I’ve never met springing out of the bushes to accost me about Weird Allan. However, I am neither cool nor musically literate, which makes me particularly vulnerable to misusing algorithmic Discovery—the practice in which artificial intelligence has become most widely-deployed which continues to prove itself to better deserve the term “automated wallowing,” or “robotized ear rot.”

Ironically, Damon Krukowski’s aforementioned “responsibility” essay on *Pitchfork* openly cites Liz Pelly’s burning-hot and [100%](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly)[ essential analysis](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-muzak-pelly) of algorithmically-generated playlists for *The Baffler* notes the publication’s own substantial relationship with Spotify, including a [Webby Award-winning](https://www.webbyawards.com/winners/pitchfork-spotify-inside-discovery/) advertorial series called *Inside Discovery*, which the two collaborate to produce that’s “meant to boost awareness of the ‘Discover Weekly’ feature.”

> The series shows Pitchfork editors (and favored musicians) gushing about their love of streaming—the immediacy! The deep back catalogs! One editor says it helps him keep track of his listening habits, while another rejoices at not having to dig through crates at record shops anymore. Yet another likens Spotify to walking around a music festival, discovering something new at every turn. What does it mean for “the most trusted voice in music” to celebrate an algorithm as preferable to its own crate digging? What does it mean when the tastemaking humans endorse data-driven machines? What does it mean when the algorithms become cool? Virtually every music publication now relies on Spotify media players to embed songs within online articles, and Websites like Pitchfork and Rolling Stone regularly celebrate their playlists with listicles: “Ten Albums To Stream Now.” “The Five Playlists You Need to Hear This Summer.”

We love bespoke Open Web projects, so exploring *Inside Discovery*’s (surely bespoke) experience induced the same pathetic sort of *I wish business just incentived building nice things* disappointment which has become my default, bitchy mood, and blaming as a further let down to immediately land on [Mitski’s ](https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski)[playlist](https://insidediscovery.pitchfork.com/playlist-mitski), to whom I’d just been [reintroduced](https://pitchfork.com/features/profile/dont-cry-for-mitski/) (by *Pitchfork*, admittedly) after happening upon her performance at Pitchfork 2017 (which is organized, admittedly, by *Pitchfork*.)

Upon a brief review of these once-petty desires and the new, apocalyptic solutions which we are burning barns full of cash to develop, it would appear that the overwhelmingly defining feature of those which are at all viable remains to be the interference of a human being, and why wouldn’t it be, still, when manual music aggregation remains so desperately cheap? I’d wager heavily that there’s at least a single editor within Apple Music who’s spent serious time embedded in the Berlin techno scene considering how regularly the prime “Techno” playlist is updated with new work of a moderately-industrial bias.

“The downside to automated music Discovery is that we’re encouraged to develop a taste profile and stick to it,” [opines somebody on *Pigeons & Planes*](https://pigeonsandplanes.com/in-depth/2016/03/music-discovery-algorithms), complimenting Pelly in their profile of former BBC Radio 1 host, Zane Lowe, and his new job curating an Apple Music playlist? 

The truth is, the stories that come to us that smell the strongest of philanthropy on the surface are often actually about some dusty, Y2K-lookin’-ass nerd with powerfully tedious grievances and too much time on their hands. The whole world knows the details by now of how Mark Zuckerberg’s horny social ineptitude led to Facebook’s conception, but we must both keep in check the bad habit we share – the whole present-day reading world and I, that is – of dwelling entirely too much on the most “negative,” soul-agitating tales in what we perceive to be the pursuit of necessary ingredients for concocting a better solution. Bandcamp’s story is predominantly comprised of smart decisions, sincere transparency, and savvy ideas which are best examined in contrast, I’m afraid, with all that’s being done *wrong* everywhere else.

> Are my favorite punk bands now Bandcamp bands? Are they suddenly wanting to conform to a kind of Bandcamp aesthetic? I don’t think so. Not yet. But if that does happen, something might be lost — a sense of these bands defining themselves as they want to, which is sort of the Bandcamp promise in the first place. People can use help navigating the riches of Bandcamp. But its estimable editorial project opens an interesting question: When does help turn into tastemaking?

# The Creators

You missed it, didn’t you—the ten-year anniversary of Bandcamp’s launch? Ashamed, I realized last month that I did, too. Ashamed, because I owe a lot to to the platform’s unwavering commitment to the distribution and curation of work made by just about all of my favorite artists—within and outside of my social network. Throughout 2015, I hosted a number of conversations with exceptional, future-looking creators on *Drycast* which I am especially proud of. On one [early episode](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Juke-Master-Samantha-Carter-and-the-Producers-Extravaganza-e1neqc/a-a4674c) with an exceptional total of *seven* music makers, I observed in a beat that “all of us have Bandcamp accounts,” before the week’s guest, Samantha Carter, suggested that she’d found her page especially financially rewarding, and originated the concept of the “Bandcamp Sugar Daddy” (which I personally ship 100%.)

<iframe sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-top-navigation allow-popups allow-forms" scrolling=no width="100%" height="auto" frameborder="0" src="https://embed.radiopublic.com/e?if=extratone-radio-WYDa1L&ge=s1!f76e4396345722808b3064eb45ca7053ea92f219"></iframe>

“It's something I take for granted,” said my friend [yzome](https://twitter.com/yzome) – a [truly one-of-a-kind electronic producer](https://yzome.bandcamp.com/) who’s far-traveling composition is probably the closest Digital Audio Workstation equivalent of Extreme Use Testing—when automotive manufacturers effectively torture new prototypes with the most inhospitable conditions on Earth until they break. However, it’s not a PR stunt in yzome’s case—he’s just very good at doing what he does after doing it for nearly 10 years—and his end product requires a hell of a lot more than any one genre would ever presume, but it more than delivers back on the investment with significant interest.

When [he appeared on *Drycast*](https://anchor.fm/extratone/episodes/Electronic-Producer-Yzome-and-his-Alien-Sound-e1lmcj/a-a41qc5) in January 2015, we failed to achieve any descriptors more sophisticated than “alien sounds,” but perhaps that’s all they need: the inner worlds into which yzome invites us are of manic, unpredictable arrhythmia which poses an unapologetic, yet magically lighthearted challenge to any cohesive theory. It’s very rare that his proudly-ungenreable exploration of the fringes does not demand the listener’s full attention, yet it always manages to be *inoffensively aggressive* like **nothing** else, which suggesting promise for the possible upheaval of a long-upheld natural law among electronic dance music: yzome doesn’t need to be a shithead to challenge the listener intellectually.

<iframe style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=586326190/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=641807133/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://yzome.bandcamp.com/album/yvette">YVETTE by yzome</a></iframe>

Play *[YVETTE](https://yzome.bandcamp.com/album/yvette)* for any boomer you know with that classically impenetrable disgust for *all* electronic music, and you’ll witness firsthand how special yzome’s particular innovation truly is. No, they’re not going to be *sexually liberated*, or anything—it’s still going to be alarming—but you’ll notice that the swift and overwhelming fury which sample and break-heavy dance music has always awoken within them has been miraculously circumvented. Instead of immediately storming off, they’ll be paralyzed in an existential fugue state from which they may never quite fully emerge. I’ve seen it firsthand. It’s witchcraft.

There is no other across the (especially-wide) electronic spectrum who can so loudly go so far, so fast without any insincerity, whatsoever. His arrangement seems mischievous and all over the place, but really listen and you’ll hear rips of recognizable patterns playing peekaboo in willy-nilly bursts that reveal his dynamic mastery of the dance music space through Breakcore, Juke, Footwork, and Techno sampling. All of this is to say, really, that yzome’s music represents a level of boundary-pushing which only a niche audience tends to truly appreciate, yet is undoubtedly worthy of an elegantly-presented host like Bandcamp.

"Like thank god I don't have to look for a label to release this. It's seen as a legitimate platform (by people who might actually care about what I’m doing, at least,) which I think is less offputting than uploading things to Mediafire or whatever else. It’s populist and boutique at the same time."

***Populist, yet boutique***. Can we really be expected to exceed this summation? Well, nobody’s said much at all in the mainstream press, but what *has* been said is 1) unusually misplaced in the spaces of those least likely to find it relevant and 2) *way* more insightful than you’d expect. 

“Bandcamp has an independent-artist identity because of practicalities: Independent artists from Web-centered subcultures need it most,” observed an especially savvy online aside from by [Ben Ratliff](http://benratliff.net/)—jazz and pop critic for *The New York Times—*asking “[Is Bandcamp the Holy Grail of Online Record Stores](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/arts/music/bandcamp-shopping-for-music.html)?” So why aren’t we talking about it? The other important takeaway: founder Ethan Diamond told Ratliff that “the company has never spent money on promotion.” This is largely why I’ve invested so much time and affection into this piece—gratitude is not often sellable incentive for mainstream coverage. 

The truth is, the continued obscurity of Bandcamp’s story despite all it’s done comes down not to any malpractice by the company (in fact, it would likely be more visible had it fucked up more,) or even to its prevalence in the careers of big industry names (whom I will address in detail shortly,) but because it simply operates too magnanimously for its customers to be taken seriously as a newsworthy business, which is problematic and personally infuriating. In November, 2015, Bandcamp made mention in *The New Yorker* via the openly diminutive context of *Car Seat Headrest’s* [origin story](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu), describing it as “a charming alternative,” and “a casual, low-risk approach.” Granted, it’s worth noting that the platform did not address its lack of “editorial guidance” until a year later, with the [launch](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/06/13/welcome-to-bandcamp-daily/) of the excellent *Bandcamp Daily* blog, but I think you’ll agree it’s in poor taste to argue against the legitimacy of a *music* distribution platform because it’s *too democratic.* Perhaps it’s still just beyond reasonable expectations to get a top-of-the-foodchain music writer’s head wrapped around the idea that such products on The Internet can easily—even optimally—service both hobbyists and professionals.

Last year, Bandcamp was responsible for [$270 million in payments](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2018/02/12/the-bandcamp-2017-year-in-review/) to artists like Jlin,the genius commonly associated with Footwork (certainly Chicago’s most underreported and popularly underrepresented movement,) for pushing its expressive boundaries both in theory and geography further than any other, and who’s so far produced two of the most “[aggressively](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/qvv37m/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively-beautiful-music-youve-ever-heard)[ beautiful](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/qvv37m/jlin-is-making-the-most-aggressively-beautiful-music-youve-ever-heard)” records you’ll find anywhere in the process.[[i\]](#_edn1) Type her name into any search engine and her Bandcamp page is *always* the first result, yet Cntrl-Fing for “Bandcamp” will yield 0 results from her interviews with *The Fader*, *FACT Magazine*, *Pitchfork*, *The Seventh Hex*, *Passion of the Weiss*, *PopMatters*, *Crack Magazine*, *DUMMY*, *The Guardian*, *The Quietus*, *BOMB Magazine*, *Ableton Blog*, *The Creative Independent*, *Rolling Stone*, *SPIN*, *No Fear of Pop*, *self-titled magazine*, *Circulation Magazine*, *The New Yorker*, *Cyclic Defrost*, *Mixmag*, or *melting bot*, and only one in *Interview Magazine*. To be clear: I am **not** arguing that Jlin—a black female music artist—should be profusely thanking Bandcamp—a service founded largely by white male programmers—for hosting her most visible page but rather that the more independent of these publications, especially, should mention its role in her story or—at the very least—be hyperlinking to [her Bandcamp page](https://jlin.bandcamp.com/) first, for both her’s and their readers’ sake—Bandcamp’s cut of album purchases is half of iTunes. From the user experience perspective, it’s absurd that those of these pages including embedded music players chose to use SoundCloud’s—which is more resource heavy (yet of noticeably lesser streaming playback quality) and visually disruptive—instead of [Bandcamp’s](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2013/06/12/all-new-players-up-twitter-too/).

<iframe style="border: 0; width: auto; height: auto;" src="https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=2765736108/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=00006b/tracklist=false/transparent=true/" seamless><a href="http://jlin.bandcamp.com/album/black-origami">Black Origami by Jlin</a></iframe>

The two services were launched the same year—that fateful 2008—but comparing them is complicated. They are clear opposites in at least one principal: how they’ve defined their mission. Bandcamp has changed less throughout its history than any other Web service that comes to mind (see below,) but SoundCloud has struggled with identity issues, to their vastly-superior success (in terms of user statistics, anyway.) *The New York Times* [reported in June, 2011](https://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/soundcloud-an-audio-sharing-site-hits-5-million-users/) that they’d reached 5 million users, citing their decision to expand focus beyond “popular music” to explain the milestone. “We’re building a sound platform that’s not just about music,” said Alex Ljung – a SoundCloud co-founder and the company’s chief executive at the time – and its present landscape certainly reflects a diverse offering of uses, but ultimately, any . Today, both SoundCloud and Bandcamp have premium subscription plans for artists which are at least *perceived* to be competitive with one another—[SoundCloud Pro](https://blog.soundcloud.com/2013/03/11/introducing-soundcloud-pro/) and [Bandcamp Pro](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2012/06/25/new-features-up/), respectively—along with free base experiences, which we’ll compare first.

**Free Bandcamp Account
 Uploads**: quantity unlimited, size of each file limited to 291mb.
 **Distribution**: unlimited streaming, up to 200 free downloads per month.

**Free SoundCloud Account
 Uploads**: total of 3 hours uploaded at any given time.
 **Distribution**: unlimited streaming, unlimited downloads.

Both offer access “basic” statistics for their tracks at this tier which most of the creators I know consider more than enough—the usefulness of any playback/download stats is negligible when you’re publishing within tight niches—and each has had about 5 years to fine-tune their free offerings so that they feel as complete as possible. If you’re planning on publishing a podcast on SoundCloud, you’re obviously going to have to upgrade your upload limit even beyond Pro ($8/month, 6-hour upload limit) to Pro Unlimited ($16/month, unlimited uploads,) though I would suggest a plethora of alternative methods before you got that far. Unfortunately, they would not include a free Bandcamp account. While [there ](https://bandcamp.com/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover)*are* [podcasts on Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/?g=podcasts&s=top&p=0&gn=0&f=all&w=0#discover), they’re completely separate the platform’s aspirations and without support for the basic requirements of podcast distribution (namely, RSS feeds.)

Bandcamp’s Pro option is $10 a month and includes a custom domain, batch file uploading, private streaming (for press and/or fans) plus the ability to disable *free* streaming (requiring listeners to actually buy the music to enable any playback,) ad-free video hosting (which nobody uses, to my knowledge,) extended fan interaction tools, and a broader statistics suite that includes Google Analytics support. SoundCloud’s Pro and Pro Unlimited options are complimentary, but a full-time independent artist could justify maintaining Pro accounts on both services or neither—one does not necessarily replace the other, but the contrast in their chosen presentations has led to a divide in the cultures of the two communities so stark [it could be a punchline](http://www.thefader.com/2017/04/03/bandcamp-artists-vs-soundcloud-artists-meme) and/or simplified to say that *SoundCloud is for rap* and *Bandcamp is not*.

It’s not entirely shocking, then, that SoundCloud’s story has been more present in the greater conversation than Bandcamp’s. Frankly, its largest issues are directly related: compared to SoundCloud, **Bandcamp’s community is White As Fuck** (a claim I can only make on behalf of my own observations and those which a select few creators have seen fit to express to me over the years, considering that the company has yet to release any demographic information about its creators) which is a glaringly fundamental obstruction to the project’s broader mission to help music culture “[thrive](https://bandcamp.com/about).”

From a future historian’s perspective, the battle for the definitive name in independent digital music distribution has already won, largely thanks to its relationship with Chance The Rapper, who’s quickly become a “cultural influencer, thought leader, global star,” and one of my generation’s upmost celebrity champions. Obviously, there is little sense trying to determine whether SoundCloud *earned* his partnership or landed their popular association with his name as long as the artist maintains it publicly, while continuing to [give new meaning](https://soundcloud.com/pitchfork/pitchfork-presents-in-sight-out-chance-the-rapper) to the phrase “serially likable.” Thus far, his mythical power to exude purity has felt virtually 100% airtight Last year, his second album *Coloring Book* made history when it won the [first streaming-only ](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/12/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy/)[Grammy for Best Album](https://www.engadget.com/2017/02/12/chance-the-rapper-first-streaming-only-grammy/). In my personal favorite moment in recent popular culture memory, the fashionable-as-hell young man [accepted the accolade](https://youtu.be/FkAJ_BU66Zs) by looking the whole industry establishment in the face and proclaiming “this is for every indie artist—everybody who’s been doin’ this mixtape shhhh...*tuff* for a long ass time... shouts out to every independent artist out there; [shouts out to SoundCloud for holding me down](https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/12/14594672/chance-the-rapper-grammy-awards-2017-soundcloud).” Obviously, such significant, sentimental, and sincere sentiments are *never* expressed about tech companies by beloved darlings of the art world like Chance—especially not for Earth-encompassing awards show audiences.

After [last year’s massive layoff](https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/6/15928674/soundcloud-cuts-40-percent-staff), it was [Chance’s assurances](https://twitter.com/chancetherapper/status/885921220759355397) that “SoundCloud is here to stay” which the public took to heart. Even if the company *is* destined to fail within the next year (it appears to be as yet missing much of a verdict,) and it’s all still destined to fold at any moment, at least it’ll have the distinct pride of doing so having maintained his publicly-expressed respect and confidence, which is a damned fine legacy in my book. Meanwhile, Bandcamp has only made a few small tweaks to its basic infrastructure, and added new features very deliberately, which haven’t resulted in a single memorable controversy. Aside from [Amanda Palmer](https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/07/amanda-palmer-sells-15k-on-bandcampin-three-minute.html), perhaps, there has never been a single band or artist who’ve been known as “from Bandcamp,” leaving our only pitch to be something like *Independent Online Music Platform on Track to Complete 10th Year Serving Small-Time Artists, Continues to Look Pretty Good*.

Considering the significance of these contributions, it’s of a special wonder that they were made not by a non-profit organization, academic movement, or government endowment, but by a for-profit, California-based tech company that’s continued to thrive and innovate great content, entirely apart from mainstream coverage.

# The Future

It might seem a bit much on the surface, but in many ways, Bandcamp has spent the past 10 years showing us what a for-profit, Web-based, culturally-edging independent platform Can be, even in the Valley.

Though Bandcamp has embarked upon unusually sparse explanation of its editorial directive in the *Daily* blog and *Weekly* podcast, but regularly consume either for any length of time, and you’ll notice a particular savvy for Discovering technically-progressive Afrocentric projects: “[Black Experimental Music](https://daily.bandcamp.com/2016/08/05/a-guide-to-black-experimental-music/).”

On [last week’s episode](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/podcasts/still-processing-tin-house-inclusion-hannah-gadsby.html) of the excellent *New York Times* podcast *Still Processing*, co-host Jena Wortham “I’m thinking a lot about ways in which new culture, new cultural products, new cultural creators come to light in ways that sidestep these traditional means and don’t have to go through the traditionally very white, very male, very cis, very hetero hoops to prove worthiness.”

So, our greatest hope for the decentralization of the music industry in the 1990s ended up transforming before us to become the most effectively divisive Discovery barrier ever known to man because of its psychological influence sub-threshold at unprecedented scale over time, in parallel with so many other like horrific monstrosities we’ve discovered in anguish to be mutants of those final salvations from our atrocious history which we’d been so relieved to believe in. Surely, the turn of the millennia was destined to be our final turning point – the moment we’d finally use our new technology to discover a truth (or maybe just a really good clue,) that’d immediately unite our species in a deafening, worldwide aha moment when it would reveal a general abstract of whatever the fuck our deal was that was preventing our silent, dutiful, and 100% harmonious collective effort toward a utopia like *Star Trek: The Next Generation*’s, in which anyone is absolutely free of obligation or desperation from birth to pursue… whatever with their time.

# Google Will Soon Replace God and The Church

![Googleplex](https://i.snap.as/tCRNZM7.jpg)

## What I have long predicted is now coming to pass: Google believes it should assume control.

Out of all the technology companies that have made my knees knock and my voice hoarse and my [Tweets manic](http://bit.ly/bluegoogle) as a technoheretic in the past several years, Jumbo Google would easily take home the winning trophy for Dystopian of the Millennium. I have been rehearsing an especially dear pet prophecy of mine, unsolicited, to family, friends, and podcast guests since 2011 in which I end up arguing quite convincingly that Google is a dead ringer for the 16th-century Vatican: an inherently self-isolating organization with an absolute monopoly yielding *gargantuan* levels of essentially passive income from a service which nearly everybody transacts with, but only Google understands (and is therefore assumed to be its only possible provider,) which inevitably develops such a distance from the rest of the populace and their way of life (in tandem with total notoriety and celebrity among them all) not intentionally out of malice, but from the delusion of mythically-bestowed philanthropic duty that is borned of and compounded by this economic and cultural isolation in a perpetual accumulation of power and wealth that radicalizes the monopolizers — the majority already highly predisposed to zeal as they would’ve needed to be in order to find themselves in this singular, universally powerful position over every other class — and leaves their egocentric minds to wander exempt from all criticism save for that of fellow radicalized monopolizers, who together begin to feel more and more comfortable wondering aloud about themselves in increasingly fantastic presumptions: *what if all of this was bestowed upon us because we are superior to them? What if it is our* **divine responsibility** *as superior beings to take charge and shepherd the common people as our sheep — for they cannot possibly know as well as we what is truly best for them?*

You see it, right? And you can feel a very specific flavor of terror that is both awed by the scale of the circumstances created by so few human minds and sincerely amused by the absoluteness of your own inability to alter them in any way. Perhaps you even recognize this taste as one perfected by Christianity’s ancient advertising business, but Google knows so much about you that it’s rumored to’ve been selling user data *to* the Judeochristian God for some time now at a 10% discount, and so we extrapolate and anticipate, yes?

Of course, it’s admittedly satisfying for me to deliver you to this godfearing place in the most perverse *look what I saw first that you didn’t see because you’re just not as bright but lucky for you, I’m so fucking generous with my wisdom* sort of thinking around which the entire personas and livelihoods of fringe movement fanatics are built upon, but this is my *one* thing, okay? I’ve been waiting years for the right time to formally argue this theory in depth, and — thanks to this year’s public spotlight finally pivoting on the giants who’ve been silently swallowing their competition and relentlessly forcing their already ridiculous margins higher and higher in relative obscurity for decades, the time has come, indeed. The common people’s trust in Google had a godawful week.

## Don’t Be Evil

On Monday, [*Gizmodo*](https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300)[ reported](https://gizmodo.com/google-employees-resign-in-protest-against-pentagon-con-1825729300) that twelve frustrated Google employees were quitting the company in protest of their work assisting the Department of Defense to “implement machine learning to classify images gathered by drones” for the detail fleeting Project Maven, despite some [4000 employee signatures](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/technology/google-letter-ceo-pentagon-project.html) on a [letter](http://extratone.com/library/dearsundar.pdf) addressed to CEO Sundar Pichai requesting (in full) that he “cancel this project immediately,” and “draft, publicize, and enforce a clear policy stating that neither Google nor its contractors will ever build warfare technology,” citing the infamous “Don’t Be Evil” motto, which Google [**then proceeded to remove**](https://gizmodo.com/google-removes-nearly-all-mentions-of-dont-be-evil-from-1826153393) from its [code of conduct](https://web.archive.org/web/20180504211806/https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html) for the first time in 18 years **the day after** the *New York Times* article went to press, on April 5th.

On initial approach to the abstract of this story, from the ass to our thoughts arrives an easy narrative of a Silicon Valley mutiny comprised of twelve brave, conscientious souls who’ve been eaten up inside by their complicity in the filthy deals made by their power-obsessed CEO over scotch and cigars in a dark D.C. study — kept awake for months by the sound of his puffing cackles at satellite images of dead toddlers in a bombed-out street.

*Ah ha*, we say. *That man is no good, and he just wouldn’t listen! They knew they didn’t have a choice… They only did what they had to do…*

The reality of internal disagreements at Google, though, manages to be even more theatrical. The sheer volume of correspondence must surely be beyond anything capable of the enduser’s imagination, so let’s phone a friend: my favorite peek into the day-to-days of inter-Google existence is an [old blog post](http://bentilly.blogspot.com/2010/01/things-ive-learned-at-google.html) by [Benjamin Tilly](https://twitter.com/btilly) on his first month at the company in which he was compelled almost immediately to describe in great detail how best to “deal with a lot of email in gmail” at peak efficiency using shortcuts and labels.
“As you get email, you need to be aggressive about deciding what you need to see, versus what is context specific.”

Now we have a bit better idea of the *aggressive emailing* that was a sure constant on a normal workday at Google in 2010, so it must’ve been deafening after 8 years of Gmail development as 4000 employees no doubt vented, debated, and decided to organize last month, though without making much headway because the leadership’s response was apparently “complicated by the fact that Google claims it is only providing open-source software to Project Maven,” this new knowledge having *significant* effect on our mind’s image of Sundar Pichai’s activities in Washington: he is now swapping seats with a frustrated Colin Powell in order to install OpenOffice onto his desktop from a flash drive, and we recall that Google’s Googleplex headquarters resembles nowhere in modern life more than a brand new playground built in a design language borrowing heavily from *Spy Kids*. And though these Twelve disciples are unnamed for the moment, a few of them could immediately land book deals by going public, and every single one would always have by default not only the badge of “I landed a job at Google,” (which is really to say *I have hit Life’s maximum level cap*,) but “I worked at Google for a while, but ended up quitting to do something else,” which is guaranteed to make you the most interesting, intellectually superior person present in *whatever* crowd for the rest of your life. The ultra-cool [Sarah Cooper](https://twitter.com/sarahcpr) quit Google to become a comedian and even [got to talk to Kara Swisher](https://www.recode.net/2018/1/10/16871786/sarah-cooper-comedian-google-dick-costolo-kara-swisher-recode-decode-podcast)!
I won’t pretend to understand big tech’s diminutive bastardization of prestige, but “more than 90 academics” jumping to publish an [open letter](https://www.icrac.net/open-letter-in-support-of-google-employees-and-tech-workers/) (adjacent to a huge *DONATE: Support the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots* button) in which they “write in solidarity with the 3100+ Google employees” who’s terrible boss decided to help some lackeys in the Pentagon set up their email and didn’t text back for a whole hour doesn’t sound 100% sincere. Notably, I don’t know how *or why* the fuck 90 people would go about collaborating on a single document, but if it really was managed, they definitely used Google Docs…
At one point, it was fun to think about the history of the friendly side-scroller-playing garage ghouls and dorm dorks who gave *cooky*, *wacko* names to their dot com startups in parody and defiance of the lame-ass surname anagrams on the buildings of their established competitors, but those who’ve stuck around have only done so by becoming expert at SUCKING UP EVERYTHING around them, and it pisses me off every day how worried I am that my species will finally be done in by a company with a name like Yahoo! and be known only to a bunch of adolescent interdimensional silicon blobs 30 million years in the future as *that bipedal race who remained dignified until the last 0.01% of their reign on Earth, when in way less than a single generation, they all just went* **FUCKING INSANE** *and blew themselves up because they suddenly hated all sense.*

“Google” is perhaps the worst of these to have to shout in fear and/or anger in your last moments as it sounds in American English like you’ve startled your subject with a ticklish pinch followed so immediately by an esophagus-busting chokehold that the two events appear simultaneous, and in real English English, it almost always sounds like a parent speaking of a character on a pre-K children’s television programme whom they find quite foul and upsetting, but will manage to refrain from expressing so otherwise because they know that *Teletubbies* shit is the most quickly forgotten stage of television viewership. It’s fascinating how exclusive the word “Google” is to American English because in everything else it really *is* complete nonsense, but lets halt all etymological discussions right now because we’ve only now just finished with Monday.

## The Soul Ledger

On Thursday, all of my Google experiences, suppositions, and [soul-detaching screenshots](https://twitter.com/FickleCrux/status/914767928456749056) were usurped when a thoroughly alarming internal company video called [*The Selfish Ledger*](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/17/17344250/google-x-selfish-ledger-video-data-privacy) was leaked to *The Verge,* which I watched once then and do not want to watch again for the sake of this piece, but I will. Though the big V has been disappointingly timid for years about editorializing — when tech journalism desperately needs some confident, informed opinion more than ever — Vlad Savov’s accompanying article should be read in its entirety, to which I can add my own terror where he perhaps could not.
The production style is technically identical to that of the very popular thinkpiece-esque, motion-graphics-paired-with-obligatory-sharpie illustrated videos which you find playing at max volume on your mom’s iPad from where she’s fallen asleep on the couch at 9PM, but the repeating stock string soundtrack multiplies one’s discomfort as such that we would all end up in the fetal position without remembering the transition were it not for the appearance of trusty old Dank Jenkins, who’s face I thankfully associate heavily enough with [his infamous ](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352)[*down-and-out*](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352)[ Tweet](https://twitter.com/richarddawkins/status/389432783304548352) to be a welcome respite in attention before the very scary hypothesis for which it’s been buttering me up, as best summed by Vlad:

> The system would be able to “plug gaps in its knowledge and refine its model of human behavior” — not just your particular behavior or mine, but that of the entire human species. “By thinking of user data as multigenerational,” explains Foster, “it becomes possible for emerging users to benefit from the preceding generation’s behaviors and decisions.” Foster imagines mining the database of human behavior for patterns, “sequencing” it like the human genome, and making “increasingly accurate predictions about decisions and future behaviors.”  

The next time the *what if they do something scary* question comes up in a casual conversation about Google, you’ll have something a lot more substantial than just speculation. Or will you? *The Verge* reached out for comment and got an awfully convenient response.

> This is a thought-experiment by the Design team from years ago that uses a technique known as ‘speculative design’ to explore uncomfortable ideas and concepts in order to provoke discussion and debate.  

Wow! Leave it up to grand ole Googe to reveal the ultimate excuse for just about any suggestion or behavior, though it does seem almost *deliberately* uncomfortable, doesn’t it? No matter — whether or not this video was ever about a project or tangible product development, or simply to *explore uncomfortable ideas* because it is proof that the company has reached that critical Vatican stage — if you’ll remember — where they now feel comfortable *exploring* Very Bad, but Very easily made Real Ideas amongst themselves about what would happen if they allowed their system to *nudge its users* around a different, slightly less optimal route to the bar, let’s say — without their knowledge — in order for the system to collect traffic data for the sake of its own interests? Which would be, technically, in the interest of all Ledger users now and in the future, so why not?

> The ledger could be given a focus, shifting it from a system which not only tracks our behavior, but offers direction towards a desired result.”  

This, my dear privacy-obsessed friends, is the *real issue* with data collection — its power over huge groups by way of their behavior and it is *never* going to be remedied in any significant way by ad-blockers or VPNs because the EndUser shall always out number you 50 to 1, even decades from now. EndUser does not understand — or, crucially, *have any desire* to understand anything technical about what leads to the PewDiePie videos playing on his filthy screen. Here’s a great opportunity to escape Silicon Valley’s technolibertarianism and resign your Darwinian empathy in favor of meaningful and truly-effective action: if you want to avoid a future Google Church (or Google Government, more worryingly,) you should invest your time, effort, and knowledge into electing officials more capable of understanding and regulating Big Tech.

## Google Government

The internet as it stands is made possible by Google as *the* goto resource for online advertising. In 2016, “Google held 75.8 percent of the search ad market, bringing in $24.6 billion in revenue from search ads,” [according to ](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth)[*Recode*](https://www.recode.net/2017/3/14/14890122/google-search-ad-market-share-growth). By 2019, “that’s expected to grow to $36.62 billion in revenue, or 80.2 percent of the market.” Google’s edge in user behavior and targeted advertising combined with their extensive resources available developers to integrate independent platforms with Google’s software services at various levels makes it very difficult for any advertising-funded individual or organization to compete online without dipping in to the Google universe. YouTube — a Google property since 2006 — has actively invested in and supported a new career path entirely within their own platform that is rapidly becoming [popularly aspired-to by young children](https://metro.co.uk/2018/01/19/children-now-more-likely-to-want-to-become-youtubers-than-actors-7241396/), while the reality of existence as a full-time YouTuber is [far less glamorous](https://medium.com/@robertoblake/what-nobody-tells-you-about-being-a-youtuber-the-youtube-middle-class-378b77eb8bc9) than the immediately-visible surface would indicate, and the effort already expended by my generation in its pursuit has already [made us insane](http://bit.ly/searchchildren).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en" data-dnt="true" data-link-color="#00006b"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">thanks google. <a href="https://t.co/1jRtrD77R3">pic.twitter.com/1jRtrD77R3</a></p>&mdash; David Blue (@NeoYokel) <a href="https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/914767928456749056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2017</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

So, what would the internet look like if Google didn’t exist? We know they’ve been working with the government now on various projects, but what if some terrible exposed transgression of theirs suddenly warranted an immediate shutdown and seizure of all Google properties? Well, we know from [a post on Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-would-happen-if-Google-were-to-shut-down-for-30-minutes) by Googler Ashish Kedia that even 5 years ago, the sudden absence of Google for “2–3 mins” set the internet into a bit of a panic, reducing overall traffic by 40%. In the time since, we’ve all grown exponentially more dependent on Google properties: billions of people rely on Google Maps for directions and, thousands of companies (including the Pentagon and other government institutions) rely on Gmail and GSuites for intercommunication, file sharing, task management, etc., and more and more academic institutions rely on Chromebook devices running connection-dependent operating systems. It’s not much of a stretch to argue that Google’s sudden disappearance would constitute a Civil Emergency in the United States, which will only become a stronger and more serious incentive for regulatory bodies to look the other way.

Though the tangible results of advertising have been quantified significantly in the past 20 years, one can’t help but wonder after watching YouTube ads for the new Mercedes-Benz S-Class on toy unboxing videos if the companies who spend big bucks on Google advertising understand where their money is going, but they know that if they *don’t* advertise there, their competitors will. This, of course, is a fundamental practice of a monopoly, and it’s yielded Google so much fucking money that they cannot possibly spend it fast enough, as evidenced by [their investments in life extension](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/4/27/15409672/google-calico-secretive-aging-mortality-research) — so that, perhaps, they will have more time on Earth to figure it out.

When you build a collection of the world’s smartest people in a [self-sufficient environment](https://www.newyorker.com/business/currency/googles-monastic-vision-for-the-future-of-work) that discourages exploration of other lifestyles and ideas, and you sustain the society with a gargantuan, relatively low-maintenance revenue stream, you create a culture which is not only well-primed for isolationism, but is also extremely inefficient. In fact, with its [vast collection of abandoned products and properties](https://www.computerworlduk.com/galleries/it-vendors/google-graveyard-3508070/), Google must surely be one of the most inefficient companies in history. Thinking back on recent software releases along with its [recent entries into the hardware space](https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16405184/rick-osterloh-interview-new-google-hardware-vision-htc-deal), Google is also one of the worst competing tech companies. Very little aside from Gmail, Google Photos, Google Maps, and Chrome have found their place or garnered significant usership. Google Play Music is unintuitive and impossible, Google Allo and Google+ are all but forgotten addendums to other services, and Google Search — its core, original function — has been [out of control](https://theoutline.com/post/1430/google-finally-realized-that-racist-search-results-are-a-problem) for years, and all of them are designed blandly and excruciatingly tiring to look at.

## Google Shun

If this all has stirred nothing more in you than a desire to eliminate Google from your own online life as much as possible, there *are* alternatives in almost every one of the sphere’s they dominate. As of late, [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/about) has accumulated a fair amount of [buzz and coverage](https://www.theguardian.com/global/2018/may/19/google-facebook-security-data-duckduckgo) as a private, more relevant alternative to Google’s plain old search engine. Though it is clever enough to list us as the first result for “extratone,” I’ve found it simply insufficient as a replacement in my own life because, essentially, it rarely delivers what I’m looking for. By contrast, [Dropbox Paper](http://dropbox.com/paper) is such an elegant cloud notetaking and word processing software that it makes Google Docs look simply idiotic (and warrants its own review very shortly.) For getting around, know that [MapQuest](https://www.mapquest.com) is not only [still around](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/does-mapquest-still-exist-as-a-matter-of-fact-it-does/2015/05/22/995d2532-fa5d-11e4-a13c-193b1241d51a_story.html) — it’s now a very competitive mobile navigation app.

I, myself, have allowed Google as complete of access to my information and behavior as possible because I believe “privacy” is a completely futile endeavor if one wishes to be a part of society, though I do often use alternatives to Google services simply because I *fucking hate* the way they look. If you want a more complete list of services and software that allow one to shun the Google God entirely, you’ll be forced to seek out less dignified sources like [*Lifehacker*](https://lifehacker.com/5876794/going-google-free-the-best-alternatives-to-google-services-on-the-web) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/antigoogle/) and decide if the additional time you’ll spend using most of them to accomplish the same tasks is really worth your digital angst.

If Google were to be more explicit with its users and staff about its aspirations to take over control of our lives, there will be little to do but accept the future they intend to create because they’ve long been too powerful to control. In the meantime, I’d suggest you continue to use whatever software works best for you and refrain from wasting your time fretting on conspiratorial suppositions of what the tech industry may be doing to “invade your privacy,” because there is no longer any such thing, nor will there be ever again. However, I would also urge to you worship your own Gods, whomever they may be, for Google will never be worthy. I, for one, shall only pray to our Mother Sun.

# Mark Fuck and the Goofy Godheads

![Mark Fuck](https://i.snap.as/TP5r1uV.jpg)

## The monumental amount of unsubstantiated gossip and conjecture enabled every day by Facebook is lethal to the human intellect. Can fire be fought with fire?

Today, after positing on whether or not a pastry was in fact the namesake of the battleship *Bismarck*, I was told by its owner - a local woman of a far-from-excusable age - that "[I] should be on that big bang show." Upon such fuckery, I looked her in her eyes and informed her that she'd just changed my plans for the night: I was now going to go home, wrap my lips around the barrel of my Beretta, and blow my brains out. I should've known better than to so jest with a boomer immediately after receiving such glaring indicators of minimal intellectual function, but I fell for the hope - as I often do, to no avail - that such a jarring reaction would encourage reflection on her foul, tragically misled sentiments regarding the general state of youth, and perhaps even spare a peer or two from future tribulation.

Instead, she called the police.

Three round cops found me, an hour later, approaching hesitantly. Strangely enough, they were chuckling - maybe to a little joke about all the recent hubbub on the radio covering a recent wave of blatantly negligent medical care in American prisons, though I hope nervous laughter is just *SOP* when responding to a suicide threat. As all Columbia cops always are toward me, they were aggravatingly genuine and hilariously understanding. I began by simply recreating my interaction with their summoner, quoting her word-for-word, and - I swear to my new Lord - all three immediately released a choral "ohhhhh" in unison. I'll never know for sure if they actually assimilated the reality of the situation so quickly, but it'd certainly seem that way.

Clearly, I should've threatened *her* life.

Despite the day-to-day expression of our recurring wisdoms, habits, instincts, patterns and cycles of cultural metamorphosis in the discourse, the stream of "well, you know they were sayin' the world was going to end when *I* was in elementary school" to my ear has fallen abruptly silent since the inauguration. Our parents and grandparents are both impossibly fortunate and unfortunate, having to duck out as the most multiplicative (read: sickest) cerebral orgy in the history of mankind will just've begun nibbling on the slope to its climax. We'll be lucky if we'll still be able to articulate our goodbyes by the time they reach the door. Nonsense does a fuckin number on perceived wisdom, but the gaps *are* widening at a dangerous pace. Tectonic or domestic, we are all straddling expanding space, and the chill of its draft is now stealing too much of our heat to ignore.

Though it is entertaining in the moment (and otherwise redundant,) it would not be *well-to-do* of me now - nor was it, then - to leave the conversation in edgy absurdity. Yes, a part of me would like to campaign for *Sheldon* to be reclassified as an expletive, in disgust, but - as an adult in all-out sprint to make up for stalled emotional development - I must note that such a display of concern should've been at least reciprocated with a bit of explanation, if not appreciation. Still, there are much more appropriate reasons and situations in which to waste public servants' time.

It's not news - the *Theory* is providing *some* ghoulishly skewed portrayal of less-than-forty pseudointellectuals. Obviously, my savior's time was worth very little to her, but the fact that she spent any quantity of anything at all engaging with even a decidedly mainstream generationally ambassadorial bridge could be regarded - if stretched - as the result of a curious seed, which has skyrocketed in human value, as of late. It is undiscouragable. Read the trail a bit, and you'll find that your frustration is simply an expression of the terror that's ignited by the stagnancy of their pace.

*It's great that you've managed to inch over to modern-ish sitcoms from Judge Judy and* Independence Day *, mom, but you're gonna have to* ***really pick up the pace*** *and work on following a few body modification communities on the darknet.*

If an absence of *solutions* are the crux of the *blog*, here I'm now gloating.

To whom does the commoner look to for such solutions when they'd prefer not to terrorize their kooky middle age parents into a half century of brutal fasting under vows of silence?

The Big Thinkers!
The Men of the Hour.

Yes, *men.* All Big Bumbling Billionaire Imbeciles.

Elon Musk *cannot* be the Nicola Tesla of the 21st century, or even the *20th*, for that matter, because literally *every* mechanically-minded professional I've ever heard talk about battery technology has condemned it in some manner as an inescapable dead end, developmentally. Perhaps, then, the champion of electrochemical storage is *the* False Prophet.

No, I'm not capable of citing research or conjuring Mars-capable spacecraft, but I've been a bit too preoccupied with my country's class war and its [10% adult illiteracy rate](http://bit.ly/unescoliteracy). It's all well and good to be privy to romanticism, but it's not the 1960s anymore. Even Howard Hughes would be more concerned for the wellness of the species than our continued reach for the stars, were he still alive.

Well. Maybe not...

Charles Lindbergh would be, though.

We spent the 1990s preparing to rid ourselves of history because the smartest among us foresaw some facsimile of the renaissance we are currently experiencing. If they'd been shown a glimpse of [some statistics](http://bit.ly/measuringconsumerinfo) on the volume of media we consume, they'd exclaim of their pride - no doubt - in their species' capability to progress, and perhaps even their own contribution to it. However, extended observation of an average American's day-to-day life would be lamented, in disgust, and a [huge portion](http://bit.ly/millennialspew) of the blame can be placed on one t-shirt-touting cyberyokel: Mark Zuckerberg.

His name is stupid, his spawn is ruining my life, and he continues to insist upon saying shit that frightens the bejesus out of me.

[Zuckbrain](https://backchannel.com/we-are-entering-the-era-of-the-brain-machine-interface-75a3a1a37fd3) is fucking scary.

"[Wiring the globe](http://bit.ly/zuckfuck)" is fucking scary.

[Jarvis](http://bit.ly/zuckbot) is fucking scary.

But Fuck, himself wouldn't be at all intimidating without his money. The scariest bit is the lack of *class* in the criticisms of his intellectual influence. Farhad Manjoo's [attention](http://bit.ly/fuckbug) has been diligent and premium as a *Times* er's should be, but the same occupation bars him from authoring with the color of unsubstantiated claims.

Mine does not.

Elon Musk is not an apologetic genius. He's willing to [joke](http://bit.ly/aloofmusk) about his intellectual distance from the planet and its populace on Twitter. Apparently, his mind's even surpassed the need to punctuate. Crazy.

Google is well on it's way to becoming the neo-Vatican... yada yada yada, but they're too far gone - I do not have the expertise to address them. Fuck, though, is a singular short-sleeved, *Even Stevens* -haired young man [without](http://bit.ly/crowdfuck) so much as private office space (even though his sentiments on breathing room at home are [obviously inverse](http://bit.ly/fuckflex).)

Clearly, it's all just to protect him from the truth: **The Apostle John's** ***Book of Revelation*** **is about Facebook**. Fuck's cyberchild is the horseman, the beasts, *and* the plagues, stuffed into one tyrannical website.

> And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever: and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

If I can *repeatedly* trigger accidental voice calls on Fuckbook Messenger, don't tell me it's not possible to inadvertently live stream myself on the pot.

> The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

Of course, it's unlikely that Mark's essence was bred entirely of evil, but - like Tump, in many ways - he is an excruciatingly wealthy idiot. Though he *is* spending 2017 touring the United States, he [doesn't seem](http://bit.ly/fucklearning) to be all that interested in *actually* closing the gap between himself and the rest of us, which suggests that he only wants us to throw us off his extra-terrestrial, xenophobic scent. I can't imagine what *The Mothership* would really want with my Amazon browsing history, though.

> And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest of the earth is ripe.

Just to be clear, **he is not** ***The Antikhristos***.

He'd better not be, anyway.
I'd be absolutely Livid with Lucifer if his choice of a figurehead for his Big Plan was such a Fucking dork.

I mean... if Fuck wanted to spend his time crafting 6000-word essays, why the Fuck didn't he just build a Fucking CMS back in his Jesse Eisenberg era instead of *the actual* weekly-updated tower of digital Babylon? Surely, Satan would know better than to waste resources and pulverize creativity by ordering his Demonic Dev team to release regular builds for build's sake rather than on a per-need basis, but that'd be because The Tempter is an authority on *incentive* s as thoroughly as Fuck isn't.

If you’re equipped with the privilege of literacy, you’ve been reading a lot about Fuckbook’s political consequences, recently. Frankly, *it’s about Fucking time*, but I’m compelled to emphasize that the most significant motor driving the politik is fueled by the eldest, fossilized portions of our thought meat. According to Manjoo, "the News Feed team’s ultimate mission is to figure out what users want," dipping in Facebook's ocean of action data, searching for a soul.

Yet another Fuckism that suggests he's an alien: everybody knows that *nobody* knows what they want. 

There's a central mechanic of our brains that by nature wreaks a whole helluva lot of contradiction. If you've ever mentioned ADHD with your doctor, or know a hypochondriac/adderall fiend who has, you may have heard it described as "the lizard brain." Simply put, it's the brain stem, and it's responsible for the most basal and primitively emotional instincts and habits; an anti-intellectual agitant, arguing at all times for the course of action with the most immediate gratification. *The Great Clickbait War* of 2013 was a startling demonstration that revealed the strength of the hold Fuckbook had (and still has) on these reptilian bits - the true location of its power.

"In surveys, people kept telling Facebook that they hated teasing headlines. But if that was true, why were they clicking on them?"

*Volition* is the Word of the Day. Here, we must once again invoke an ancient parable from the wise foretellings of the Disney film, *Smart House*: **when dealing with human beings, boundless compliance quickly leads to abject misery for all parties involved.**

Mindlessly, habitually, endlessly clicking... **this is how we die**.

Something about Fuck's direction is fundamentally poisonous to the human mind. Yes, he *is* assuredly too Fucking democratic, but misinformation is far from the only form of evil his creation has assumed. If you can jog your memory back a bit, you'll remember a much wider variety of brain-rotting filth.

In lapses of their existences' finitude, the 40-something second cousins of the world may still send you the occasional *Can Crunch Saga* invite, jarring you back to Jr. High in 2009, and forever associating themselves in your mind with the horrors of mortality and **f u c k b o o k  g a m e s.**

Elon is a more likely candidate, but I'll leave those differentiations to the not-idle cult masses.

More than one sixth of all living eyes [see](https://newsroom.fb.com/company-info/) Fuckbook every single day, placing its consumption behind only eating and drinking as the most universally human activity.

Mr. Fuck achieved his vision and became perhaps the greatest purveyor of words who's ever lived. He's taught (or... is teaching) us something very profound about ourselves: capability is not the whole of the equation. Ability on its own cannot guarantee growth, but it can often result in decay. Discussion does not inherently lead to *connection*. Population is not a cure for isolation.

That said, I must begrudgingly admit to you that I, myself am one of the 100 million users who've depended upon a "very meaningful" Fuckbook group for a "physical support structure" for which I have Fuck to thank.

I've spent half of my existence watching cheesy barnstorming movies, whirling around die-cast biplanes, seeking out stories from old pilots - military and commercial, and eventually trained to become one myself. As regular activities at young ages do, aviation became deeply ingrained into my identity, but my local community is *very* sparse - it's not exactly *cool*, these days. On Fuckbook, an unofficial group for members of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association has allowed me to stay connected to the rest of the world's Soaring Nerds, which is no small deal. It's the only forum which I am compelled to participate in with 100% sincerity and emotional effect.

Photos of members standing proudly next to their first airplane, or of adolescent students in a similar pose after their first solo, or of three old white rubes on a hangar picnic, laughing around a fold-up table full of rudimentary ham sandwiches in front of two gleaming Stearmans...

They tug around on my heart like nothing else in life can.

I stopped flying lessons at 16 because I began to see behind the naivety of my childhood perception of what it meant to fly commercially and realized that I was unequipped for- and uninterested in the sort of challenges it presented. I haven't flown in seven years, but the community will *always* have a tremendous dividend of my core being. 

These days, not a single person in my day-to-day life knows or cares about aviation, which wouldn't be laudable whatsoever - it's not exactly the most relevant goingson at the moment - were it not so *emotionally* necessary for me. 

A few days ago, a member shared a photo with the group of Charles Lindbergh's modified Ryan cockpit, captioned "what airplane am I?"

In my youth, Lindbergh filled my closest equivalent to the 'childhood hero' role. My grandmother bought me a first-edition copy of *The Spirit of St.Louis* from a small town bookshop when I was six or seven, and I carried it *literally everywhere* with me until middle school. I watched the Jimmy Stewart film tens and tens of times, and I cried when I saw the *Spirit* in the flesh at the Smithsonian, yet I've *never* had an informed conversation about any of it with another human being. It really warmed me to see how many of the comments were correct answers. 

Breaking news: it's nice to know that there are other people on Earth who give a shit about the same things you do.

Again - aspiration should always be encouraged. This is Fuck's vision for his creation, and it *is* feasible, even for myself. At least his public persona - however valid or invalid it may be - is making a huge effort to have positive consequence, even if his idiocy is imbuing itself within all of humanity.

Fuck is too powerful to be exempted from responsibility for what Fuckbook's done to the Western psyche over the past decade, but - like the Christian god - perhaps all we need require is his repentance.

# Why I Write About Technology

![Why](https://i.snap.as/OXW0FOqh.jpeg)

[May 22nd, 2018](https://bilge.world/why)

## An autobiographical overview of my personal history with technology and its contributions to my current perspective.

Incalculable odds were against my arrival in this world happening in early 1994, positioning my life within a timeline that would allow me to bridge my two species’ most significant millenniums in the first grade as a student in the first class at Fairview Elementary school to receive curriculum-mandated exposure to brand-new Windows 98 PCs in its brand-new, fluorescent-lit computer lab in the center core of its 50-year-old rectangular brick structure. The lab also meant that ours was the first Fairview class to have the available relief of air conditioning during the school day. It’s unlikely that I would be home sick and watching the last television ever allowed in my mother’s living room as the second plane hit.

My peers and I would form a picogeneration without a name (perhaps we should be called the 9/11ers) — 91s and 92s wouldn’t have regular access to public school machines until they’d eclipsed the true prime of their development, and were just that much further along, mentally, to being able to comprehend the huge and terrifying concepts of 1) New York and 2) burning alive — while 98s like my niece were spared any such comprehension of death at all, yet now have to face the existentially future-sundering, darkly-mirrored reality of the Trump Presidency during the most critically uncertain period in the last stage of their brain’s transition to adulthood.

If there is truth in the cross-cultural supposition that souls have some sort of choice, pre-conception, over when they’re born, my own must have either cleaned out the house, or lost horrible, though I suspect I’ll never be able to confidently wager either way. This question of *how lucky or unlucky am I to be alive right now* is one which I find most fascinating — not just within myself, but within others my age. I declare us a generation largely because of my experiences under the assumption that my mid-Missouri upbringing represents the ultimate average in the American experiences of the time as the area has been a reliable sample of the clearest average of the country’s cultural, political, and economic life. Technically, it was quite unlikely that I arrive here as a new human being instead of China or India, and what if that, too was my choice?

Though less so, it was still against chance that I would be born to parents who would divorce very quickly after my birth, before my mind was able to form any tangible long-term memories, sparing me whatever pain could’ve resulted from their greater togetherness later nullified in front of me. I could’ve chosen them as well for the variety of experiences their situation would allow me as I grew up between my father’s 800-acre farm and my mother’s suburban house in Columbia, the college town an hour’s drive south. I write about my experiences now — so young — because I’ve likely already born witness to more extraordinary changes in human development than your parents, their parents, and their parents’ parents combined. At 24, my life has already spanned by far the most profound and expedited informational renaissance in human history — greater progress was made between the day I first rode a bicycle and the one on which I took my driver’s test than in thousands of years before it.

The sum of my father’s ordeals between 1950 and 1974 — from his birth until the age I am now — would indeed include watching a man set foot on a spatial body other than Earth for the first time, but would be mostly defined by work on the family’s soybean, corn, and wheat farms in central Illinois, driving carbureted tractors pulling cultivating equipment of the same basic design and function as had been pulled by horses, mules, and oxen for hundreds of years, and other implements — like the mechanical multi-row planter — that were new technology at the beginning of the century. For neighbors, he would walk behind the path of a square hay baler next to a moving flatbed trailer, upon which he would throw the 70–100 lb. rectangles of dead compacted grass by their twine through thick cowhide gloves. All of this I would get to experience in the next century on *his* farm, using the exact same equipment.

At home, he would watch NBC, ABC, and CBS on a CRT TV, as I would for several years until wireless television was legally transitioned to digital statewide in the summer of 2009. As an adolescent, he would form a business with friends cleaning out old abandoned barns in exchange for the rights of ownership to any finds inside, which led to his discovery of a hay-preserved 1929 Buick Sedan containing hand-written records of its every service. This car would change hands into his Uncle’s care as he went off to school in Champaign, married in Georgia, and eventually settled on the flat clay soil of the farm where I grew up, right on the border between Audrain and Monroe counties, Missouri. I was about 10 when we drove back to the family hub with a trailer in tow to collect the car from my Great Uncle, to my manic excitement.

Up until my mid-teens, my life was defined by my extreme reverence for historic cars, airplanes, tractors, and watercraft, and the time I spent operating, maintaining, restoring, or simply studying the assortment of these which I was allowed — often because of extraordinary circumstances — would form the component of my psychology which seeks to experience different cultures, ideas, and eras through the medium of engineering and design and relies on these to understand them. Like my father in his youth, I would learn to clean water out of a carburetor after the Oliver 88 had sat silent for too long, and I would piss in a chamber pot to avoid waking up my Grandfather by walking down creaking attic stairs and turning the lights on. I would learn how to shoot and drive before 10-years-old, and I would have the freedom to do both as I pleased on the miles of gravel roads that ran around home.

Though my stepfather bought me a PC of my own just as my first-grade computer class was ending, I could not conceive of a reason to occupy the dial-up line and block his incoming calls or faxes, so my use of the machine was limited to sparse writing and aggravating attempts to run Microsoft Flight Simulator 98 at approximately one frame per second on a 300MHz single-core Pentium II CPU. Though I was *extremely* fortunate compared to most middle-class kids my age at the time to have my own computer in my room, my relationship with it was not significant or particularly involved. I would leave it powered down for weeks at a time until my last two grades at Fairview, when homework assignments began to require it.

Perhaps the greatest gap between my mostly-suburbanite classmates and I was an exposure to Japanese entertainment and video games. I was once disallowed from a lunch table because I’d never heard of Pokémon or Luigi, but I *did* have a Sony Playstation at home on which I occasionally loaded *A Bug’s Life* to wander around its first level, perhaps in basal awe at the idea of manipulating what I saw on a screen in realtime. In self-imposed isolation from children my age, I wouldn’t develop any need to be socially competitive with video games as many of my peers would to carry with them into adulthood. I thought my interests in mechanical engineering to be above all of them, so I spent my time alone with heavy picturebooks on 20th century cars, tractors, and airplanes.

On the farm, my consistently agriculturally-proactive father was one of the first to have satellite internet for farm futures and weather reports on a pre-GUI machine which I don’t remember. As I was becoming computer literate in school, he would become extremely frustrated with the Windows XP-running machine he’d bought from a one-man, one-room computer shop in Centralia, and I would often solve some problem with bloatware or the goddamned printer. He would also subscribe to and install a first-generation DirectTV receiver, which had the first on-screen program guide I’d ever seen. In the evenings, I would watch hours of *Modern Marvels* on The History Channel, which presented the history, abstract functional theory, and implementation of a particular technology, both past and future. This single program — which has aired nearly 700 episodes since 1995 — is probably responsible for the majority of my at least rudimentary general knowledge in a variety of historic and “future” technological schools, and my curiosity about culture’s relationship with innovation.

Though my father’s interests differed significantly from mine — he thought more about growing and raising than of the tools one used to do it — he would indulge my many questions about how engines, hydraulics, and electrical systems worked, and indulged my curiosity by exposing me to the hidden communities of the most elderly, most obscure historic machinery enthusiasts like those of the Midwest Old Threshers Reunion in Mount Pleasant, Iowa — the Concours d’Elegance for antique tractor and reciprocating engine collectors. It was a similar event closer to home where I first operated a steam tractor — great, field-going locomotive-like vehicles that supplanted a need for horsepower in the late-1800s up until the Great Depression which chug, whistle, and puff along just like rail locomotives with a huge, gritty, iron steering wheel. As I recall, I was also given the opportunity to drive an unrestored Model T truck around the grounds that day — the knowledge from which I gained I cannot imagine being of much use ever again.

I was proud to the point of arrogance of my technical knowledge and experience in all the different things I had driven and operated, which my schoolmates were in no position to understand. I was elitist and anti-social about this as late as 8th grade, when I had just moved in to stay with my mother, who bought me a first generation iPhone which I proudly wore in a leather belt holster to Junior High. It would represent a shift in my fascination from very old technology toward the present and future.

I started talking online with a friend I’d first met years before at Fairview, who spent most of his time fiddling with his first-generation MacBook Pro. He originally exposed me to gadget bloggers on YouTube like Mark Watson and Jon Rettinger (both of whom are still full-time tech personalities.) My mom bought me a 13-inch aluminum-bodied MacBook (which would be sold as MacBook Pro after a single year,) and my lifestyle radically shifted inside my room, my computer, and my Xbox 360. My friend and I would both obsess together over software, design, and gadget - experimenting with our own tech YouTube channels until high school, where I would be adopted by a new friend group who would finally socialize me.

Recently, I have written about the contrasts and discrepancies of consumer technology development as its progress has disconnected from the upward linear trajectory in use, quality, and genuine innovation for the End User in a departure which has been especially visible from my perspective as an academically-untrained, but intensely demanding user in the past five years. When hardware was still the industry focus before ~2012, there was a tremendous amount of optimism among journalists and enthusiasts because each successive generation of devices had added more tangible capabilities. Publications like *Gizmodo* and *Engadget* made a fortune publishing reviews and comparison tests of hardware offerings across every segment of tech, and the discourse they generated had a noticeable influence on design. I remember this time well because it accented my last few years before adulthood, when I had plenty of spare time, energy, and curiosity to keep up.

The general consumer technology narrative since Steve Jobs’ death has become increasingly more about the companies who design and sell hardware and software than about how and why their consumers actually use them, and the result has been a series of new product segments with little defensible place in my own linear timeline of innovation, especially where productivity is involved. Augmented and Virtual Reality are quite explicitly escapist industries, yet to fill any significant need which was before unfilled. The same could be argued about voice assistants and smartwatches — neither of which *remove* obstacles in most users’ day-to-day lives but instead *contribute* to the array of tasks and devices which already seek their attention.

Of course, there are defensibly sound business incentives behind the industry’s new, fragmented direction, but I would also argue that there are those, too, for genuinely revisiting both _what we should be doing_ and what we should be seeking to _learn to do_ with technology. In a more abstract sense, I have written about whether or not we should want to be living in this particular now, and how the way we feel about the future should inform what we do in the present.

I cannot help but observe human progress from a perspective of powerlessness, acute alienation, and amused awe, which has already lent to a significant quantity of occasionally original thoughts as I watch, having witnessed an odd diversity of American life and culture. I’ve published them to entertain and to demonstrate a few methods of reflection on what it is *you* really want from the times you are living.
# iPhone and Music: For Artists, Curators, and Enthusiasts

![Music on iOS](https://i.snap.as/mTEozs2r.png)

## Reporting from deep within the iOS cult on essential apps/methods for real-life music people.

As you may or may not be aware, I’ve spent all of my 2021 so far diving real deep into iOS, considering all that has changed since “an iPod, a phone, a personal computer.” I’ve tuned in to the output of explicitly Apple-adjacent publications both old (*MacRumors*, *Apple Insider*, *9to5 Mac*, etc,) and new (*Apple Scoop*, *MacStories*,) which have all metamorphosed in huge, mostly-redeemable ways just as their primary subject has. I have my own pubescent stories of Mac occultism, but I do not consider my relationship with the brand to be an essential part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc’s story is spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain “the most valuable company in the history of the world,” as I so love to describe them. Like many of you, I’m sure, I am often compelled to bring up the humongous contrasts in the historical context of the company - to scream infinitely many variations of the observation that Apple was basically the fucking *indie*, premium-tier consumer tech manufacturer owned by the Creative Class for the first half+ of their existence, and have somehow maintained that *Think Different*™ brand narrative as they have definitively become the Big Blue of their time.

From my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of this utterly-delusional, occasionally very dangerous sentiment actually lies fairly squarely on those of us who consider ourselves *better than all of that* because of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line utilities. (For the record, this is also 100% delusional as things stand in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge, though, is that Apple’s image has been inextricably bound with *musicmaking*, throughout, far more than any other even remotely comparable tech company. Naturally, the business still loves to bring this up all the time in big, glossy gestures. The topical example of note would be the only worthwhile content I’ve yet to encounter on Apple TV+: [*Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry*](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq), which documents the highlights of the young, beloved musician’s prodigious ascension. For what it’s worth, I appreciate some special insights I gained thanks to the film, which I do not actually consider at odds with the truth of its super on-brandness for Apple.

An interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice on the *business* end of tech reporting: “[How Music Drowns Apple’s Innovation](http://thein.fo/8dba9a5022e1d273)” by *The Information*’s Jessica Lessin portrays Apple’s relationship with music distribution and the music industry as a sort of compulsive distraction from its ambitions in serving video content, namely. Lessin points out the everpresent reminders of this obsession:

>  And so it is no wonder that Apple’s first forays into original video content fall under Apple Music. It’s worth noting that the first series the company announced—“Carpool Karaoke” is literally about singing; “Planet of the Apps” features rapper Will.i.am as a judge.

I think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I suggest that the targets of Lessin’s cynicism would be more than welcome, if they were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable company in all of history retaining an “emotional” attachment to the welfare of music creators might be described as *charming* or more. As is often the case on *The Information*, the comments from readers often offer noteworthy insight. In this case, Kevin Swint - who has apparently worked as an executive for both Apple and Samsung, according to [his profile](https://www.theinformation.com/contributors/458) on *The Information* - responded with an important consideration: “…it's possible that Apple's behavior around music has more to do with the company's overall tendency to stick with its past successes a bit too long rather than music really being a core part of its DNA.”

In terms of business, that’s all I have to contribute, and I shall do my best not to evangelize Apple Music (or more likely, disparage Spotify as one of the most destructive cultural forces of our time,) here. However, I would like to respond to a particular Jimmy Iovine quote from the original Apple Music announcement amid the [2015 WWDC Keynote](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000430692668):

> There needs to be a place where music can be treated less like digital bits and more like the art it is, with a sense of respect and discovery… and if that place could actually accommodate and support the artists who make the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their bedrooms too, provide them all with a home and a way to engage with their audiences, that would be pretty great.

*Boy, this service Iovine describes sounds an awful lot like Bandcamp, no?* The suggestion that **Apple should have purchased Bandcamp** is a very scary one, from my perspective, but I am reassured by the likelihood that the notion did indeed occur to someone at Apple, Inc. at some point in the past, and was quickly discarded, for whatever reason. I promise not to mention Bandcamp again in this Post, aside from its own two iOS apps: for [listeners](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp/id706408639) and for “[Artists/Labels](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp-for-artists-labels/id1185670538)” as creator/curator tools. 

I’m going to be focusing largely on the iPhone-bound experience, here, though I did borrow my mom’s MacBook Pro for a weekend to explore the state of music on MacOS and (accidentally) played around with Apple Music on The Television. On that note, I’ll hurry up and get specific…

## Apps
Assuming you’re already an Apple Music user, it’s very possible that you’ve been deprived of the “true” experience on the service provided by the variety of actively-developed but woefully-undercovered app store entries that integrate directly with Apple Music. One of the most glaring discoveries I’ve made so far in my iOS deep dive, this year, has been the absolutely horrific state of Discovery on Apple’s App Store. If you’d thought to search the top charts under the store’s Music category, you wouldn’t find any of the gems I’m going to highlight, here. The credit for exposing me to their existence, in fact, lies with *MacStories* - a hard-hitting, well-established Apple-adjacent media company piloted by [Federico Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci). At this very moment, their app-centric podcast, *App Stories*, is in the midst of [a special mini-series](https://appstories.net/episodes/212/) devoted to Music on iOS/Mac, from which this Post draws upon heavily. For better or worse, they represent the definitive authority on this subject (among many others, naturally,) though I wouldn’t necessarily recommend their various publications be added to the reading lists of any but those most invested in iOS.

![MusicHarbor on iPhone](https://i.snap.as/4agfF1nW.png)

### [MusicHarbor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750)

There is something uniquely concrete about a purely-chronological feed which we’ve lost in the past 5-10 years in favor of algorithmic curation, generally. The [next item](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review) in _this_ particular feed, in fact, includes my attempt to explain why Twitter’s hard-chronological Lists feature has sheltered me from the anxiety of the service’s main timeline, now ordered by proprietary (and obscured) formulas. I’d been aware of that dynamic in my own Twitter consumption for years, though. I certainly did _not_ anticipate the impact of the music release equivalent of a chronological timeline as provided by [**MusicHarbor**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor/id1440405750) - an app for iOS and MacOS that acts as a frontend for one’s music library across both Apple Music and Spotify. 

It's hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without embarking upon some gargantuan _A Complete Visual History of Apple Music_-like document, but it must be said that Tim Cook's "next chapter in music" has become a sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the "streaming war" between Apple and Spotify has long since gone definitively to the latter in statistical terms, which I'd suggest to be an overall positive outcome for Apple Music subscribers, generally. The self-perception within the heavy music consumer crowd of "niche," "underground," "obscure" cultural minority should - in theory - push those who believe themselves _destined to be different_ away from Spotify into the handy care of Apple, the absolute champion of this particular self-deception. To be honest - though I write this for _all_ listeners, sincerely - I have found myself in a sort of utopian echo chamber of my own design in music culture terms. My days of waiting through 4+ hours of local openers before rap shows are far behind me, and I consume and engage exclusively with music I find personally redeemable. 

My Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I lost my entire physical music collection along with the external drives containing my accumulated digital music library in 2017. Still, after more or less starting anew this past December and casually, deliberately adding digital files back into the accursed, ancient iTunes desktop application and restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of shared curatorial playlists thanks to SongShift (which we'll glance on later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artists represented across my Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify libraries. I know this because of [a very simple Siri Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8935/) I modified which returns a text list of all Artists in one's MusicHarbor library in Quick Look. ([Here is my result](https://gist.github.com/extratone/32763d8d2d6a71ab0fe4e045a6fb4441) as of this moment in GitHub Gist form.) According my App Store receipts, I first downloaded MusicHarbor on March 26 - 20 days ago - which is mentionable because of how much I've accomplished with very minimal time investment in terms of curating my own music library thanks to MusicHarbor. As you'll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshots embedded above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my library - a single function which alone justifies the app's one-time $5.99 "Unlock Everything" fee, to my sensibility. I've also been able to begin following all the artists represented in a few of my favorite playlists with a handful of taps - a task which would literally require hours in the native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow artists, there.) On that note, it's time to cite the primary _MacStories_ article you should read, entitled "[How I Keep Track of New Music Releases](https://www.macstories.net/ios/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases/)," regarding Apple Music's performance as a release tracker:

> The ‘New Releases’ section is tucked at the very end of the For You page and laid out as a horizontal carousel that requires a lot of swiping; you can view the ‘New Releases’ page as a grid, which has sections for different weeks, but, in my experience, it only aggregates highlights for new releases from some of my favorite artists. The ‘New Music Mix’ playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded with stale data – songs I’ve already listened to multiple times and which shouldn’t qualify as “new” weeks after their original release date. Furthermore, I’ve found notifications for new releases for artists in my library unreliable at best: I occasionally get notifications for new albums, but never for new singles or EPs.

Here, Federico Viticci is riffing off [a newsletter issue](https://chorus.fm/features/liner-notes-november-1st-2019/) written by music blogger Jason Tate, in which he describes the service's missing tracking functionality as "the single most frustrating part of Apple Music." Though these points in the conversation are both almost two years old, MusicHarbor remains the ultimate means of tracking new music releases chronologically on Apple's platforms. Though I am personally just three weeks in, the confidence this app has given me in the certainty of its chronological release feed is quite profound. Its integration with one's calendar to track _upcoming_ releases is a bit much for my own needs, but I know personally enough invested curators for whom it'd be a godsend to mark it no small addition.

![MusicHarbor on MacOS](https://i.snap.as/UxLBTYvL.png)

MusicHarbor’s only downside is entirely excusable/understandable, in context: it’s a bit clunky. For the sake of this work, I set up [a shared Apple Music playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/musicharbor/pl.u-2aoq40vTaR0XmA) so I could further demonstrate all the new music I discovered in MusicHarbor. Adding whole albums to this playlist with a single tap _feels_ powerful because it _is_ - I’ve no idea what sort of developer wizardry is involved in such an action, but the Wait Wheel doesn’t feel like too much to endure. Adding a release to one’s library - the other in-MusicHarbor accumulative function - is a bit quicker. It’s important to remember that this piece of software was/is created and maintained by a single human being, though I would expect nothing but improvement, going forward.

![Adding to MusicHarbor Playlist](https://i.snap.as/yN3nbcdR.png)

That’s all I have to report on MusicHarbor, for the moment, but I’ll add further _MacStories_ praise from their [2019 MacStories Selects](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2019-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#app-of-the-year-runner-up) app rewards:

> What makes MusicHarbor special – and, ultimately, the reason why we all use the app here at MacStories – is just how much developer Tanaka understands what someone who wants to know about new music releases is looking for.

![Albums for iOS](https://i.snap.as/KylIYzaI.png)

### [Albums](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986)

On the other end of the spectrum, exploring new digital manifestations of _The Music Collection_, is [Albums](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986), which actually functions as an entire replacement frontend player for Apple Music. Reviewed [much more recently by _MacStories_](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers/), it really is best-described as “opinionated, favoring album playback over individual songs or playlists.” Considering that I installed the app just a week ago and have focused most of my attention on MusicHarbor in that time, I’ll leave most of the commentary to John Voorhees. All I can say, really, is that I see an extremely powerful application, here, for a fairly specific use case: someone who’s listening is largely occupied by albums they already “own” in Apple Music and treasure deeply. The ability to set an individual record’s “Immersive UI Tint” down to the hex (in “Album Settings”) is as in-depth a tool of adoration as I’ve ever seen in a digital music service. Combined with Albums’ presumptuous takeover of actual playback from the Apple Music app, I think I can rightfully say that it was built for the _extremely serious_ music consumer.

My favorite part so far: the app knew well enough to offer me THE ZRO BUTTON. Telling, I think. 

![The ZRo Button - Albums App](https://i.snap.as/9pNf178x.jpeg)

### Others

Since it’s already quite clear how much this Post draws from _MacStories_, I’ll let [their review of Soor](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/soor-2-review-magic-mixes-and-release-alerts-elevate-the-beautiful-apple-music-client/) stand on its own (I couldn’t quite justify spending $6.99 just for review purposes.) In the episode embedded above, they also mention [Denim](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/denim-playlist-cover-maker/id1532250420) - a playlist cover creator I am not personally all that impressed with. There’s also MusicHarbor’s sibling, [MusicSmart](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/musicsmart-puts-the-spotlight-on-music-credits/), which manages the tricky but essential task of adding the metadata retrieval Apple Music should have included all along. The rest can be found in [the episode’s show notes](https://appstories.net/episodes/213/). I’m not done with them, but the rest are what I would differentiate as _services_…

## Services

### [Odesli/Song.Link](https://song.link/ivyhollivana)

One of the bewilderingly undercovered digital music sharing tools of our kind, Odesli has been [my preferred method](https://twitter.com/search?q=song.link%2C%20%40neoyokel&f=live) of sharing tracks/albums/EPs since I first discovered it in 2018. It is _not_ specific to iOS but it _is_ **essential** for competent music sharing, anywhere, these days, in its magical ability to _correctly_ intersect any given piece of music’s links across all streaming services, known and unknown. To be honest, I thought everybody would be using it by now, but it’s continued to develop with [minimal attention](https://twitter.com/odesli_/status/1383100269320409095) aside from [Siri Shortcuts developers](https://www.notion.so/iOS-Shortcuts-0efaf0ef92c0467aa6fc201b78c8499e). Thanks to [Odesli’s Public API](https://www.notion.so/Public-API-d8093b1bb8874f8b85527d985c4f9e68), dozens of Music-centric Siri Shortcuts have emerged over the past few years, resulting in one of the most useful Siri Shortcuts integrations to be found for real, reasonable human beings. Here’s where Apple-adjacent media and I part ways…

While current common conversation might point you to Federico Viticci’s [MusicBot hyper-Shortcut](https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-musicbot-the-all-in-one-apple-music-assistant-powered-by-shortcuts/) and/or @gianflo6’s 600 action-strong [Song.Link Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5134/), I (perhaps expectedly) would point you to [my own, 17-action Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8940/) which spares you any selections and simply opens the Song.Link URL of the track currently playing in Apple Music (while also copying said URL to the clipboard.) It’s not that MusicBot isn’t massively impressive and still useful, but it represents a class of super/hyper-Shortcuts which (from my perspective) _far_-overreach beyond the intended use case for Siri Shortcuts and end up immediately bewildering/alienating potential new users. Truthfully - as Federico singularly acknowledges - they are full _applications_ built atop a less-than-ideal platform designed for relatively simple, _repeatable_ automations. I’ll spare you further opining on this idea until another, potential Post, and instead demonstrate my personal solution.

In the clip above, you can see I was working on this very draft when LoneMoon’s “[kawAii @F](https://song.link/i/1554970332)” started playing. Naturally, I was compelled to share it on Twitter, so - without leaving Drafts (my writing app) - I called the [type-to-Siri](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/siri-iphaff1d606/ios) prompt by holding the Sleep/Wake button on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and simply typed “sl” (I renamed my Shortcut for this use,) running the Shortcut, which opened the track’s Song.Link page in Safari - very much an optional step, mostly just to make sure the match is correct - and copied its URL to my clipboard, from which I could share it anywhere. Since the advent of widgets in iOS’ [Today View](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-widgets-to-the-home-screen-iphb8f1bf206/ios), I’ve also kept a button for this Shortcut in one of four precious slots in a box at the very top. For those willing to play around a bit, it should be fairly straightforward to configure the end bits to your liking, but it should work out of the box for even those least interested in Siri Shortcuts/automation in general.

![SongShift Playlist Transfer](https://i.snap.as/64kwh52h.png)

### [SongShift](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/songshift/id1097974566)

As I confessed before, it is only thanks to SongShift that I was able to recover anything of my original, prized, deeply-considered Apple Music playlists. The [standalone _MacStories_ article](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/songshift-3-0-and-switching-between-apple-music-and-spotify/) on this one is a bit dated, but I don’t see much change in function in that time. For most people, SongShift’s free service is simply the best way to transfer a playlist between music streaming services. If you find yourself genuinely sold by the features offered by [SongShift Pro](https://songshift.com/pro), I suspect you know more about playlist manipulation than I could ever learn you by diving in any deeper.

![Lastfm on iOS](https://i.snap.as/HLJEWX0B.png)

### [Last.fm](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/last-fm/id1188681944) (I s2g.)

Yup… Believe it or not, Last.fm is _still fucking scrobbling_ after 19 fucking years (almost to the day,) and its iOS app still fucking works. What’s most bizarre about this truth is that I did not encounter mention of Last.fm for _years_ until I started noticing it as an integration option in the settings menus of _these premium iOS apps_. Is this some sort of conspiracy? I’m not sure, but I suppose I might as well insist you follow my ancient account, if you’re still using it. 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1383167889583214592

I should also note that not only is the Last.fm iOS app still working, it’s _working well_, from all appearances, anyway. Though the service no longer includes hosting, itself, it’s apparently still a prime player in the world of **playback tracking**.

## Music Creation

### DAWs

What if you actually want to “make” music with your iPhone? We’ve seen iPhone television ads for years featuring amalgamations of musician-looking types playing instruments with cables attached to their handsets, but is the iPhone now a reasonable platform for any sort of serious sound capture? The short answer is **no**. Who am I to proclaim such an absolute? None other than the motherfucker who’s been messing around with mobile DAWs for [10 whole years](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/150752825129971712). I even “released” an “[album](https://dieselgoth.bandcamp.com/album/holistic-compliance-portal)” on Bandcamp made exclusively with Apple’s own GarageBand for iOS and inspired by the dangerous life of the contemporary raw milk smuggler. I wouldn’t call it “music,” per se, or an example of what a _real_ electronic producer could pull off in the app, but it does represent its capabilities in the hands of the average user, using mostly default loops.

https://soundcloud.com/dieselgoth/wurlie-jam

While Apple does publish an Apple Book entitled “[Everyone Can Create Music](https://books.apple.com/us/book/everyone-can-create-music/id1434741739)” about GarageBand on iOS, it is specifically directed at _iPad_-bound use. Any serious DAW user uses keyboard shortcuts, which I admit I only discovered recently in GarageBand for iOS. The [official documentation](https://support.apple.com/guide/garageband-ipad/use-keyboard-shortcuts-chs88452c59a/ipados) is - once again - for iPad, specifically, but most of them still work on iPhone.

[**FL Studio Mobile**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fl-studio-mobile/id432850619) - the original third-party iOS-bound DAW - is still going, apparently. While I did, indeed purchase the original version on my iPhone 4, I remember absolutely nothing about it, suggesting I was over my head, even then. There’s also [**Auxy**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/auxy-music-beat-maker/id1034348186), as covered recently in [this App Store Story](https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1478814064) and [**Reason Compact**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reason-compact-make-music/id1253419004). I’ve played around with these more recently - since they’re both available in their most primitive forms as a free download - with little to report. 

### Capture

Disappointingly, Apple’s own Music Memos - as demonstrated by Chris Welch from _The Verge_ in the embed, above - is currently in the process of being [officially sunsetted](https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168102/apple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export,) and is now no longer available for download on the App Store. As that article notes, users are instead directed toward GarageBand or ye olde native [**Voice Memos**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/voice-memos/id1069512134) to record high quality audio. _However_, if you want to take advantage of the **stereo audio recording** capabilities included in iPhones after the [11 Pro](https://www.dxomark.com/apple-iphone-11-audio-review/), you must either use the native Camera app to capture video (and extract the audio later,) or [**Dolby On**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dolby-on-record-audio-video/id1443964192) - Dolby’s own iOS app for recording which - if I’m completely honest - will do nothing but _utterly frustrate_ anyone trying to capture the truest digital audio possible.  

https://youtube.com/watch?v=GhAknEKy9Ig

As part of my [iPhone 12 Pro Max Review](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/45), I’ve accumulated quite a few audio files in various formats testing its capture abilities and stashed them in [this folder](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/tree/main/audio/Capture%20Testing) on _The Psalms_’ GitHub Repository. Probably the most relevant of these, though, is embedded just above. If you’ll forgive my pajamas, ridiculous piano faces, and general rustiness with the instrument, it demonstrates the “**Audio Zoom**” feature found in the iPhone 11 Pro and up, which I’ve found to be unfortunately underdocumented by Apple, itself. I added my own inquiry to [this post on the official Developer forums](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/124512?answerId=671299022#671299022) asking about it, but don’t really expect anything back. According to “[What is Audio Zoom for smartphones](https://www.dxomark.com/what-is-audio-zoom-for-smartphones/)?” published on the site _DxOMark_:

> The main technology behind audio zoom is called beamforming, or spatial filtering. It allows changing an audio recording’s directivity (that is, the sensitivity according to the direction of the sound source) and shape it in any way necessary. In this case, the optimal directivity is a hypercardioid pattern (see illustration below), which enhances sounds coming from the front direction — that is, from the direction in which your camera is pointed — while attenuating sounds from all other directions (your background noise).

My testing has suggested that **the best means of recording unfiltered-as-possible stereo audio with an iPhone is to record video at 1x zoom with the native Camera app** and extract the audio from the video file. In the [Bandcamp track embedded below](https://davidblue.bandcamp.com/track/-), I “mounted” my 12 Pro Max right above my old upright’s soundboard and extracted audio directly from the video file with Audacity. It was then amplified slightly, saved to a FLAC file and uploaded directly to Bandcamp. Of course, it’s worth qualifying that - while I have extensive experience with audio - I have neither professional training, nor any professional monitoring equipment.

# Underdocumented Maneuvers in iOS

## Peep this dope listicle of iPhone Pro Tips

It became most apparent during my research for my iPhone 12 Pro Max Review that Apple’s mobile operating system and all that it entails has changed profoundly over the course of its history even moreso than is immediately obvious. The operating system that thwarted the very idea of the Power User currently has numerous features that were added explicitly for them. (One might suggest this really began in iOS 12, with [Siri Shortcuts](http://bilge.world/siri-shortcuts-ios12-review).) The trouble is that many of these features overlap into what the most average user might use in their day-to-day operation of their handsets and tablets. **Showing timestamps in iMessage**, for instance, is a function which one should not have to stumble upon or take to an internet search to find. (_Swipe from right to left in a conversation_.) Little functions like this are incredibly poorly documented, considering iOS is maintained by the most valuable company in the history of the world.

Apple does make an effort to educate new users, mainly through the [Tips app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tips/id1069509450), which has indeed become more useful and insightful over time, but still leaves a whole lot to be desired. They also publish an owner’s manual-esque *[**iPhone Users Guide**](https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewBook?id=1515995528)*, which is unfortunately completely inaccessible in any format outside of the native Books app. (I made a not-insignificant effort to convert the volume to a PDF for your sake, but found myself completely defeated by DRM, hilariously.) Some of the functions listed in this post are accompanied by links to Apple Support web pages, but far too many have no such entries, which - from my perspective - is absolutely inexcusable on Apple’s part. Inexcusable, but perhaps not inexplicable. 

It would seem that the vast ecosystem of both professional and amateur technology media which reports on iOS has inadvertently filled in for Apple in the role of documentarian. Search YouTube for “iPhone Tips” and you’ll manifest a multitude of results with titles like *[16 ACTUAL iPhone Tricks You Didn’t Know Existed!](https://youtu.be/YKOY6-ZdUo8)* which haphazardly (and often distastefully) do the company’s job for them.

![Music on iOS](https://i.snap.as/mTEozs2r.png)

## Reporting from deep within the iOS cult on essential apps/methods for real-life music people.

As you may or may not be aware, I’ve spent all of my 2021 so far diving real deep into iOS, considering all that has changed since “an iPod, a phone, a personal computer.” I’ve tuned in to the output of explicitly Apple-adjacent publications both old (*MacRumors*, *Apple Insider*, *9to5 Mac*, etc,) and new (*Apple Scoop*, *MacStories*,) which have all metamorphosed in huge, mostly-redeemable ways just as their primary subject has. I have my own pubescent stories of Mac cultism, but I do not consider my relationship with the brand to be an essential part of my identity, as so many do and have. Apple, Inc’s story is spectacular and infinitely-relevant so long as they remain “the most valuable company in the history of the world,” as I so love to describe it. Like many of you, I’m sure, I am often compelled to bring up the humongous contrasts in the historical context of the company - to scream infinitely many variations of the observation that Apple was basically the fucking *indie*, premium-tier consumer tech manufacturer owned by the Creative Class for the first half+ of their existence, and have somehow maintained that *Think Different*™ brand narrative as they have definitively become the Big Blue of their time.

From my perspective, the responsibility for the wellbeing of this utterly-delusional, occasionally very dangerous sentiment actually lies fairly squarely on those of us who consider ourselves *better than all of that* because of our Debian workflows and their ancient command line utilities. (For the record, this is also 100% delusional as things stand in 2021.) One thing I think we can all acknowledge, though, is that Apple’s image has been inextricably bound with *musicmaking*, throughout, far more than any other even remotely comparable tech company. Naturally, the business still loves to bring this up all the time in big, glossy gestures. The topical example of note would be the only worthwhile content I’ve yet to encounter on Apple TV+: [*Billie Eilish: The World’s a Little Blurry*](https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/billie-eilish-the-worlds-a-little-blurry/umc.cmc.5waz3hfo9r1133t8arap8b6nq), which documents the highlights of the young, beloved musician’s prodigious ascension. For what it’s worth, I appreciate some special insights I gained thanks to the film, which I do not actually consider at odds with the truth of its super on-brandness for Apple.

An interesting take I found from 2017 from a new favorite voice on the *business* end of tech reporting: “[How Music Drowns Apple’s Innovation](http://thein.fo/8dba9a5022e1d273)” by *The Information*’s Jessica Lessin portrays Apple’s relationship with music distribution and the music industry as a sort of compulsive distraction from its ambitions in serving video content, namely. Lessin points out the everpresent reminders of this obsession:

>  And so it is no wonder that Apple’s first forays into original video content fall under Apple Music. It’s worth noting that the first series the company announced—“Carpool Karaoke” is literally about singing; “Planet of the Apps” features rapper Will.i.am as a judge.

I think I can speak for the majority of my audience when I suggest that the targets of Lessin’s cynicism would be more than welcome, if they were The Whole Truth. Indeed, the most valuable company in all of history retaining an “emotional” attachment to the welfare of music creators might be described as *charming* or more. As is often the case on *The Information*, the comments from readers often offer noteworthy insight. In this case, Kevin Swint - who has apparently worked as an executive for both Apple and Samsung, according to [his profile](https://www.theinformation.com/contributors/458) on *The Information* - responded with an important consideration: “…it's possible that Apple's behavior around music has more to do with the company's overall tendency to stick with its past successes a bit too long rather than music really being a core part of its DNA.”

In terms of business, that’s all I have to contribute, and I shall do my best not to evangelize Apple Music (or more likely, disparage Spotify as one of the most destructive cultural forces of our time,) here. However, I would like to respond to a particular Jimmy Iovine quote from the original Apple Music announcement amid the [2015 WWDC Keynote](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665?i=1000430692668):

> There needs to be a place where music can be treated less like digital bits and more like the art it is, with a sense of respect and discovery… and if that place could actually accommodate and support the artists who make the music, not just the top-tier artists, but the kids in their bedrooms too, provide them all with a home and a way to engage with their audiences, that would be pretty great.

*Boy, this service Iovine describes sounds an awful lot like Bandcamp, no?* The suggestion that **Apple should have purchased Bandcamp** is a very scary one, from my perspective, but I am reassured by the likelihood that the notion did indeed occur to someone at Apple, Inc. at some point in the past, and was quickly discarded, for whatever reason. I promise not to mention Bandcamp again in this Post, aside from its own two iOS apps: for [listeners](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp/id706408639) and for “[Artists/Labels](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bandcamp-for-artists-labels/id1185670538)” as creator/curator tools. 

I’m going to be focusing largely on the iPhone-bound experience, here, though I did borrow my mom’s MacBook Pro for a weekend to explore the state of music on MacOS and (accidentally) played around with Apple Music on The Television. On that note, I’ll hurry up and get specific…

<iframe allow="autoplay *; encrypted-media *; fullscreen *" frameborder="0" height="175" style="width:100%;max-width:660px;overflow:hidden;background:transparent;" sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin allow-scripts allow-storage-access-by-user-activation allow-top-navigation-by-user-activation" src="https://embed.podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/213-music-part-2-music-discovery-playback-and-utility-apps/id1227872143?i=1000516779249"></iframe>

## Apps
Assuming you’re already an Apple Music user, it’s very possible that you’ve been deprived of the “true” experience on the service provided by the variety of actively-developed but woefully-undercovered app store entries that integrate directly with Apple Music. One of the most glaring discoveries I’ve made so far in my iOS deep dive, this year, has been the absolutely horrific state of Discovery on Apple’s App Store. If you’d thought to search the top charts under the store’s Music category, you wouldn’t find any of the gems I’m going to highlight, here. The credit for exposing me to their existence, in fact, lies with *MacStories* - a hard-hitting, well-established Apple-adjacent media company piloted by [Federico Viticci](https://twitter.com/viticci). At this very moment, their app-centric podcast, *App Stories*, is in the midst of [a special mini-series](https://appstories.net/episodes/212/) devoted to Music on iOS/Mac, from which this Post draws upon heavily. For better or worse, they represent the definitive authority on this subject (among many others, naturally,) though I wouldn’t necessarily recommend their various publications be added to the reading lists of any but those most invested in iOS.

![MusicHarbor on iPhone](https://i.snap.as/4agfF1nW.png)

### [MusicHarbor](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor-track-new-music/id1440405750)

There is something uniquely concrete about a purely-chronological feed which we’ve lost in the past 5-10 years in favor of algorithmic curation, generally. The [next item](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review) in _this_ particular feed, in fact, includes my attempt to explain why Twitter’s hard-chronological Lists feature has sheltered me from the anxiety of the service’s main timeline, now ordered by proprietary (and obscured) formulas. I’d been aware of that dynamic in my own Twitter consumption for years, though. I certainly did _not_ anticipate the impact of the music release equivalent of a chronological timeline as provided by [**MusicHarbor**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/musicharbor/id1440405750) - an app for iOS and MacOS that acts as a frontend for one’s music library across both Apple Music and Spotify. 

It's hard to remember how we (Apple Music) got here without embarking upon some gargantuan _A Complete Visual History of Apple Music_-like document, but it must be said that Tim Cook's "next chapter in music" has become a sad afterthought. As far as I understand it, the "streaming war" between Apple and Spotify has long since gone definitively to the latter in statistical terms, which I'd suggest to be an overall positive outcome for Apple Music subscribers, generally. The self-perception within the heavy music consumer crowd of "niche," "underground," "obscure" cultural minority should - in theory - push those who believe themselves _destined to be different_ away from Spotify into the handy care of Apple, the absolute champion of this particular self-deception. To be honest - though I write this for _all_ listeners, sincerely - I have found myself in a sort of utopian echo chamber of my own design in music culture terms. My days of waiting through 4+ hours of local openers before rap shows are far behind me, and I consume and engage exclusively with music I find personally redeemable. 

My Apple Music library has become quite fragmented after I lost my entire physical music collection along with the external drives containing my accumulated digital music library in 2017. Still, after more or less starting anew this past December and casually, deliberately adding digital files back into the accursed, ancient iTunes desktop application and restoring some (outdated) versions of my handful of shared curatorial playlists thanks to SongShift (which we'll glance on later,) MusicHarbor currently lists 1433 artists represented across my Apple Music and (very sparse) Spotify libraries. I know this because of [a very simple Siri Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8935/) I modified which returns a text list of all Artists in one's MusicHarbor library in Quick Look. ([Here is my result](https://gist.github.com/extratone/32763d8d2d6a71ab0fe4e045a6fb4441) as of this moment in GitHub Gist form.) According my App Store receipts, I first downloaded MusicHarbor on March 26 - 20 days ago - which is mentionable because of how much I've accomplished with very minimal time investment in terms of curating my own music library thanks to MusicHarbor. As you'll note in the 3rd of the 4 screenshots embedded above, I was able to delete System of a Down from my library - a single function which alone justifies the app's one-time $5.99 "Unlock Everything" fee, to my sensibility. I've also been able to begin following all the artists represented in a few of my favorite playlists with a handful of taps - a task which would literally require hours in the native Apple Music app of old (when one could actually follow artists, there.) On that note, it's time to cite the primary _MacStories_ article you should read, entitled "[How I Keep Track of New Music Releases](https://www.macstories.net/ios/how-i-keep-track-of-new-music-releases/)," regarding Apple Music's performance as a release tracker:

> The ‘New Releases’ section is tucked at the very end of the For You page and laid out as a horizontal carousel that requires a lot of swiping; you can view the ‘New Releases’ page as a grid, which has sections for different weeks, but, in my experience, it only aggregates highlights for new releases from some of my favorite artists. The ‘New Music Mix’ playlist is not terrible, but it often comes loaded with stale data – songs I’ve already listened to multiple times and which shouldn’t qualify as “new” weeks after their original release date. Furthermore, I’ve found notifications for new releases for artists in my library unreliable at best: I occasionally get notifications for new albums, but never for new singles or EPs.

Here, Federico Viticci is riffing off [a newsletter issue](https://chorus.fm/features/liner-notes-november-1st-2019/) written by music blogger Jason Tate, in which he describes the service's missing tracking functionality as "the single most frustrating part of Apple Music." Though these points in the conversation are both almost two years old, MusicHarbor remains the ultimate means of tracking new music releases chronologically on Apple's platforms. Though I am personally just three weeks in, the confidence this app has given me in the certainty of its chronological release feed is quite profound. Its integration with one's calendar to track _upcoming_ releases is a bit much for my own needs, but I know personally enough invested curators for whom it'd be a godsend to mark it no small addition.

![MusicHarbor on MacOS](https://i.snap.as/UxLBTYvL.png)

MusicHarbor’s only downside is entirely excusable/understandable, in context: it’s a bit clunky. For the sake of this work, I set up [a shared Apple Music playlist](https://music.apple.com/us/playlist/musicharbor/pl.u-2aoq40vTaR0XmA) so I could further demonstrate all the new music I discovered in MusicHarbor. Adding whole albums to this playlist with a single tap _feels_ powerful because it _is_ - I’ve no idea what sort of developer wizardry is involved in such an action, but the Wait Wheel doesn’t feel like too much to endure. Adding a release to one’s library - the other in-MusicHarbor accumulative function - is a bit quicker. It’s important to remember that this piece of software was/is created and maintained by a single human being, though I would expect nothing but improvement, going forward.

![Adding to MusicHarbor Playlist](https://i.snap.as/yN3nbcdR.png)

That’s all I have to report on MusicHarbor, for the moment, but I’ll add further _MacStories_ praise from their [2019 MacStories Selects](https://www.macstories.net/stories/macstories-selects-2019-recognizing-the-best-apps-of-the-year/#app-of-the-year-runner-up) app rewards:

> What makes MusicHarbor special – and, ultimately, the reason why we all use the app here at MacStories – is just how much developer Tanaka understands what someone who wants to know about new music releases is looking for.

![Albums for iOS](https://i.snap.as/BxyH2mj8.png)

### [Albums](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986)

On the other end of the spectrum, exploring new digital manifestations of _The Music Collection_, is [Albums](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/albums-album-focused-player/id1469948986), which actually functions as an entire replacement frontend player for Apple Music. Reviewed [much more recently by _MacStories_](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/albums-4-0-a-must-have-app-for-music-lovers/), it really is best-described as “opinionated, favoring album playback over individual songs or playlists.” Considering that I installed the app just a week ago and have focused most of my attention on MusicHarbor in that time, I’ll leave most of the commentary to John Voorhees. All I can say, really, is that I see an extremely powerful application, here, for a fairly specific use case: someone who’s listening is largely occupied by albums they already “own” in Apple Music and treasure deeply. The ability to set an individual record’s “Immersive UI Tint” down to the hex (in “Album Settings”) is as in-depth a tool of adoration as I’ve ever seen in a digital music service. Combined with Albums’ presumptuous takeover of actual playback from the Apple Music app, I think I can rightfully say that it was built for the _extremely serious_ music consumer.

My favorite part so far: the app knew well enough to offer me THE ZRO BUTTON. Telling, I think.

### Others

Since it’s already quite clear how much this Post draws from _MacStories_, I’ll let [their review of Soor](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/soor-a-third-party-apple-music-client-for-iphone/) stand on its own (I couldn’t quite justify spending $6.99 just for review purposes.) In the episode embedded above, they also mention [Denim](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/denim-playlist-cover-maker/id1532250420) - a playlist cover creator I am not personally all that impressed with. There’s also MusicHarbor’s sibling, [MusicSmart](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/musicsmart-puts-the-spotlight-on-music-credits/), which manages the tricky but essential task of adding the metadata retrieval Apple Music should have included all along. The rest can be found in [the episode’s show notes](https://appstories.net/episodes/213/).

### [Odesli/Song.Link](https://song.link/ivyhollivana)

One of the bewilderingly undercovered digital music sharing tools of our kind, Odesli has been [my preferred method](https://twitter.com/search?q=song.link%2C%20%40neoyokel&f=live) of sharing tracks/albums/EPs since I first discovered it in 2018. It is _not_ specific to iOS but it _is_ **essential** for competent music sharing, anywhere, these days, in its magical ability to _correctly_ intersect any given piece of music’s links across all streaming services, known and unknown. To be honest, I thought everybody would be using it by now, but it’s continued to develop with minimal attention aside from [Siri Shortcuts developers](https://www.notion.so/iOS-Shortcuts-0efaf0ef92c0467aa6fc201b78c8499e). Thanks to [Odesli’s Public API](https://www.notion.so/Public-API-d8093b1bb8874f8b85527d985c4f9e68), dozens of Music-centric Siri Shortcuts have emerged over the past few years, resulting in one of the most useful Siri Shortcuts integrations to be found for real, reasonable human beings. Here’s where Apple-adjacent media and I part ways…

While current common conversation might point you to Federico Viticci’s [MusicBot hyper-Shortcut](https://www.macstories.net/ios/introducing-musicbot-the-all-in-one-apple-music-assistant-powered-by-shortcuts/) and/or @gianflo6’s 600 action-strong [Song.Link Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/5134/), I (perhaps expectedly) would point you to [my own, 17-action Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8940/) which spares you any selections and simply opens the Song.Link URL of the track currently playing in Apple Music (while also copying said URL to the clipboard.) It’s not that MusicBot isn’t massively impressive and still useful, but it represents a class of super/hyper-Shortcuts which (from my perspective) _far_-overreach beyond the intended use case for Siri Shortcuts and end up immediately bewildering/alienating potential new users. Truthfully - as Federico singularly acknowledges - they are full _applications_ built atop a less-than-ideal platform designed for relatively simple, _repeatable_ automations. I’ll spare you further opining on this idea until another, potential Post, and instead demonstrate my personal solution.

In the clip above, you can see I was working on this very draft when LoneMoon’s “[kawAii @F](https://song.link/i/1554970332)” started playing. Naturally, I was compelled to share it on Twitter, so - without leaving Drafts (my writing app) - I called the [type-to-Siri](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/siri-iphaff1d606/ios) prompt by holding the Sleep/Wake button on my iPhone 12 Pro Max and simply typed “sl” (I renamed my shortcut for this use,) running the Shortcut, which opened the track’s Song.Link page in Safari - very much an optional step, mostly just to make sure the match is correct - and copied its URL to my clipboard, from which I could share it anywhere. Since the advent of widgets in iOS’ [Today View](https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/add-widgets-to-the-home-screen-iphb8f1bf206/ios), I’ve also kept a button for this Shortcut in one of four precious slots in a box at the very top. For those willing to play around a bit, it should be fairly straightforward to configure the end bits to your liking, but it should work out of the box for even those least interested in Siri Shortcuts/automation in general.
# Apple’s C.E.O. Is Making Very Different Choices From Mark Zuckerberg
## Tim Cook views privacy as ‘one of the top issues of the 21st century.’ Other tech leaders don’t seem to agree.

(SINGING) When you walk in the room, do you have sway?

[MUSIC PLAYING]

Kara Swisher
I’m Kara Swisher, and you’re listening to “Sway.” My guest today is Apple CEO Tim Cook. He’s been at Apple for 23 years and at the helm of the company for almost 10, having inherited the reins from the late Steve Jobs. When Cook got the top job, Apple’s market cap was close to $350 billion. Today, it’s worth over $2 trillion. It churns out billions of devices that are hugely popular worldwide, but the company is also now in the crosshairs of antitrust investigators due to its massive size and power. Epic Games is suing Apple, for example, alleging the company is a monopoly. And other developers are also complaining to regulators. Meanwhile, some users of the so-called free speech network Parler have also taken issue with Apple for removing Parler from its App Store. It was a move made by Apple and by Google and Amazon after the Capitol attacks. They maintain that Parler failed to moderate dangerous content related to the attempted insurrection on January 6. Cook has also become a hero to some, doubling down in an impassioned speech and a major privacy conference recently, calling out the tech industry, especially social media companies, over misuse of consumer data.

Archived Recording (Tim Cook)
If a business is built on misleading users on data exploitation, on choices that are no choices at all, then it does not deserve our praise. It deserves reform. We should not look away from the bigger picture. At a moment of rampant disinformation and conspiracy theories juiced by algorithms, we can no longer turn a blind eye to a theory of technology that says all engagement is good engagement.

Kara Swisher
Tim Cook, welcome to “Sway.” That was quite a speech. I was surprised by how strongly you put it. You were talking about social media companies there and those that use data. You took Parler off. How did you think about that decision?

Tim Cook
Well, in some ways, it was a straightforward decision, because they were not adhering to the guidelines of the App Store. You can’t be inciting violence or allow people to incite violence. You can’t allow hate speech and so forth. And they had moved from moderating to not being able to moderate. But we gave them a chance to cure that. And they were unable to do that or didn’t do that. And so we had to pull them off. Now, having said that, Kara, I hope that they come back on. Because we work hard to get people on the store, not to keep people off the store. And so, I’m hoping that they put in the moderation that’s required to be on the store and come back, because I think having more social networks out there is better than having less.

Kara Swisher
The day of the attack, I was actually interviewing the C.E.O of Parler. It was quite an astonishing interview. Did you listen to what he said? He said, I don’t have responsibility. I don’t take any responsibility.

Tim Cook
And obviously, that doesn’t adhere to the App Store terms and conditions.

Kara Swisher
Yeah, you had been working with them previously on these issues, too.

Tim Cook
We believe that at a point in time, they were compliant.

Kara Swisher
And then they were not.

Tim Cook
And then they were not.

Kara Swisher
Yeah, and lots of tech companies acted at the same time, whether it was Amazon, Google, you, and others. It was sort of like a house of cards sort of fell in on them. Should it have been done before?

Tim Cook
It happened as soon as we became aware of it. And I’m not sure it would have taken the Capitol event for that to occur. We would have taken it off when we became aware. After giving some time to cure, we would have taken it off. And again, I can’t stress enough, I hope they come back.

Kara Swisher
Yeah, I want to talk about the hearings on Capitol Hill last month. You weren’t there, but the CEOs of three tech companies were — Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, Jack Dorsey of Twitter, and Sundar Pichai from Google and Alphabet. Congressman Mike Doyle asked all three tech executives to answer yes or no to the same question, which was a little reductive. I would have asked it slightly differently. But he wanted to know whether their companies bore any responsibility for spreading misinformation and planning the attack on the Capitol. They didn’t answer. They sort of tried to walk around it. Jack Dorsey kind of answered — said yes, but, essentially. How would you have answered for those companies or for Apple, or technology in general?

Tim Cook
Well, I can only speak for Apple. And from the very start, we’ve always believed in curation. And so we review every app that goes on the store. That doesn’t mean that we’re perfect at doing it. We’re not. But we care deeply about what we’re offering our users. And when we have a news product like Apple News, we have human editors that are selecting the key stories. And so, they’re avoiding all of the misinformation that is out there. The reality is that the web in some areas has become a dark place. And without curation, you wind up with this firehose of things that I would not want to put into an amplifier.

Kara Swisher
Right.

Tim Cook
Which is what tech is, in a large way. If you have a platform, you amplify things.

Kara Swisher
Do you consider Apple an amplifier?

Tim Cook
Well, I think in areas like the selection of stories on Apple News, we have human editors do that. Even though the App Store isn’t a push, so we’re not pushing things in your feed like a social media company would be, a lot of people are coming to the App Store. And so we want that to be a safe and trusted place to be.

Kara Swisher
What is the broader culpability of Big Tech in the context of things like the attack? Because you did actually address it in your speech on privacy. A lot of people give some culpability to social media sites. And Apple does not have one. Ping never sort of took off. I remember Ping was the social network Apple had that —

Tim Cook
Yeah, I do remember. I’m glad you reminded me.

Kara Swisher
Yeah, I remember Steve. He says, what do you think of Ping? It sucks. And he’s like, yes, yeah, it does. It really does. But do you think social media sites were culpable in the attack?

Tim Cook
I think that the amplification of social media is something that I deeply worry about. And the targeting tools, the same tools that are used to target in advertising can be used to target for misinformation purposes or extremist purposes. And so I deeply worry about that. The people I fault the most for the Capitol attack are the people that obviously were in the attack itself, that breached the Capitol. But I think it’s incumbent on all of us to take a step back and ask, what were the other contributing factors? Because we don’t want to repeat it. This was one of the darkest days in our history. And it played out in front of all of us. I felt like it was more of a movie or something, that it was something that was not real, that it couldn’t be happening in the United States of America. And so I’m hopeful that that deep inspection occurs.

Kara Swisher
So one of the things this calls for amending Section 230, which is, of course, the part of the Communications Decency Act that protects platforms from getting sued because of content of the user’s post. Do you think liability is important?

Tim Cook
I’m not big on suing as a lever. I think 230, it was written at a time prior to lots of things that have come into existence. And they weren’t envisioned. And so, I think it’s time to revisit 230. But I don’t have an answer of what the perfect way to revise 230 would be.

Kara Swisher
So let’s talk about the solutions. I want to get into privacy, which Apple has been pushing rather hard as well. How do you look at data and privacy bills that are being contemplated?

Tim Cook
Generally speaking, I think privacy is one of the top issues of the 21st century. And I think we’re in a crisis.

Kara Swisher
OK.

Tim Cook
Years ago, I thought companies would regulate themselves and sort of get better. I no longer believe that. And I’m not generally somebody that is keen on regulation, but I think that regulation is required.

Kara Swisher
What made you not believe it? What tipped you over?

Tim Cook
Because I saw companies continually going outside of what I thought were reasonable rails.

Kara Swisher
Mm-hmm. One of the things you said in that speech, if we accept as normal and unavoidable that everything in our lives can be aggregated and sold, we lose so much more than data. We lose freedom to be human. Talk about what you meant by that.

Tim Cook
If you think about a surveillance world, a world where you know somebody is always watching everything you’re doing — and in the case of a phone or a computer, it’s also what you’re thinking, because you’re typing in searches and so on and so forth. And so I think in that kind of world, you begin to do less. You begin to think less. Your freedom of expression begins to narrow. And the walls move in on you. And I start thinking about that at its natural endpoint. And I don’t want to be a part of that society.

Kara Swisher
And why is it important for Apple to speak up on this? You sell the phones that allow these apps to do those things. You’ve used it as a brand attribute in advertising, very strong advertising standing up for privacy. Why are you speaking out so strongly about it?

Tim Cook
It’s not about being a brand attribute, to be frank. For us, privacy is a basic human right. And it’s a right that other rights are built off of. It’s that kind of core. It’s bedrock. And it’s not something that I just decided a few years ago. As I remember, Steve commented on this with you over a decade ago. He said something like, privacy means people know what they’re signing up for in plain English, repeatedly. The individual should own their data. And they should own the ability to say who gets it and what of their data they get and what they use it for. And frankly, that’s not the situation of today.

Kara Swisher
Are you surprised by the amount of data thievery, essentially, that goes on?

Tim Cook
I’m appalled by it. And so we’ve got things coming out like a privacy nutrition label. Privacy policies have become these multi-page things that people just blindly say, I agree, so that they can go to the next screen and move on. A privacy nutrition label, much like a nutrition label on food, gives you at a glance some key information. We’ll improve that over time. And then the one, Kara, that’s probably gotten the most attention is called ATT.

Kara Swisher
Yes, we’re going to get into that.

Tim Cook
App Tracking Transparency, and what it tries to get at is companies that are taking advantage of tracking you across apps of other companies, and therefore putting together an entire profile of what you’re thinking, what you’re doing, surveilling you across the web 24/7.

Kara Swisher
Right, using devices you make as the vehicle to do so.

Tim Cook
They are using all technology for these, whether —

Kara Swisher
Yeah, right. I’m just saying in your case. So let’s make it easy for people to understand. When exactly is the new update coming out?

Tim Cook
It’s just a few weeks now.

Kara Swisher
All right, and it’s called ATT, which is App Tracking Transparency.

Tim Cook
That’s right.

Kara Swisher
Obviously, companies like Facebook and many others make a lot of money from data collected from those trackers. How will the consumers see it? What is going to happen?

Tim Cook
They’ll see a simple pop-up that basically prompts them to answer the question of, are they OK with being tracked or not? If they are, things move on. If they’re not, then the tracking is turned off for that individual with respect to that specific app.

Kara Swisher
Right, and will it tell them what’s tracking to let them make a decision? Because just saying, do you want to be tracked, most people are like, stopped? No, no thank you.

Tim Cook
The developer can put essentially other information in there. Maybe they say that it’s for better ads or better targeted ads or whatever. All we want to do is supply a tool so that the person that should make the decision can make it.

Kara Swisher
You’re guiding them there, though. You are guiding them to doing this. Why did you decide to do this now?

Tim Cook
Kara, every year, we add privacy features. If you look back in time, we’ve added some every year. It is not aimed at a company. It’s aimed at a principle. And the principle is that the individual should be in control over whether they’re tracked or not, who has their data. It’s that simple. And if you were designing such a system from scratch today, of course you would do this. Of course, it should be your decision of what happens to your data, not mine or somebody else. And people that argue against that choice is essentially saying that they didn’t have informed consent before. And I think that’s a powerful point in and of itself.

Kara Swisher
Right, but Facebook, the company’s privacy stance, Facebook said, was meant to benefit your own bottom line. And you’re in this fight with Facebook. And what is your response to Facebook’s response, which is quite vehement, calling you, essentially, an existential crisis to their business?

Tim Cook
All we’re doing, Kara, is giving the user the choice whether to be tracked or not. And I think it’s hard to argue against that. I’ve been shocked that there’s been a pushback on this to —

Kara Swisher
Really?

Tim Cook
— this degree. To this degree. Because I mean, how do you argue against that? It’s sort of like —

Kara Swisher
They have a lot of them. You’re hurting small businesses. That it’s part of your bottom line.

Tim Cook
But we know these things are flimsy arguments.

Kara Swisher
So you say you’re surprised by this pushback. I’m surprised you’re surprised, I guess. You’re aiming at the heart of those businesses.

Tim Cook
First of all, I don’t really agree with that — with that assertion. I think that you can do digital advertising and make money from digital advertising without tracking people when they don’t know they’re being tracked. And I think time will prove that out. I’ve heard this about other things we’ve done in the past that it’s almost existential and it wasn’t. I don’t buy that.

Kara Swisher
What will be the result of the impact on Facebook’s business, do you think? I’m going to use Facebook because they’re the biggest, and they’re the ones that collect the most data. But Google also does, and many others do.

Tim Cook
Yeah, Kara, I’m not focused on Facebook, so I don’t know. I’m just saying —

Kara Swisher
But they called you their “competitor,” so you don’t see it this way? You don’t view them as a competitor to Apple?

Tim Cook
Oh, I think that we compete in some things. But no, if I may ask who our biggest competitor are, they would not be listed. We’re not in the social networking business.

Kara Swisher
Mm-hmm. All right, let me ask you one more Facebook — I’m sorry to bug you about this. But we spoke three years ago on stage in Chicago. It was after Cambridge Analytica news broke when I asked you to imagine yourself in Zuckerberg’s shoes in his situation. I want you to hear this clip. And here’s what you said.

Archived Recording (Tim Cook)
We’ve always felt really responsible for —

Archived Recording (Kara Swisher)
Mark Zuckerberg — what would you do?

Archived Recording (Tim Cook)
What would I do? I wouldn’t be in this situation.

Archived Recording (Kara Swisher)
OK. [LAUGHTER]

Kara Swisher
People seemed to like that answer. Do you feel that way now?

Tim Cook
You know I can only talk about the choices that Apple has made.

Kara Swisher
Mm-hmm. And this is a good choice, this transparency tracker.

Tim Cook
I feel very emphatically that it is. That data minimization, getting as little as you need, making sure you need what you’re getting, challenging yourself to get less and less and less and less, and then security is the underpinning for privacy, right? And encryption and there’s a whole bunch of things we could talk about there by itself.

Kara Swisher
Well, let me ask that. Several years ago, you were in a fight over encryption. This is after the 2015 San Bernardino terrorist attack. The FBI asked Apple to build a backdoor to unlock the attacker’s phone. You opposed the order, citing the danger to privacy.

Tim Cook
Yes, we cited the danger to hundreds of millions of customers because you can’t build a singular backdoor. The backdoor that they were asking for was in the operating system and would affect everybody that owns an iPhone.

Kara Swisher
And then the Justice Department ended up unlocking the iPhone without Apple’s help.

Tim Cook
Yep.

Kara Swisher
Where do you stand now on that?

Tim Cook
I think it was the right fight. I think encryption is still under fire today. There’s still people that believe that the government should have a — should either have a key or have access to a key or have a door or access to a door. And our point of view hasn’t changed on that. It’s that once you have a back door, you have a back door for everybody. There’s not a way in technology today to have a back door just for the good guys.

Kara Swisher
All right, you’re being sued right now by Epic Games, which makes the wildly popular game “Fortnite.” Back in August, Epic tried to circumvent Apple’s App Store. Basically, they wanted to avoid Apple taking a 30% cut of the in-app purchase. So they introduced their own direct payment system. You kicked “Fortnite” off the store for breaking the rules. You may not be able to talk specifically, but what was the principle at stake here?

Tim Cook
It’s about living up to the rules and the guidelines of the App Store. And they had done that for years and then had decided evidently that they didn’t want to follow the rules anymore, and had passed something through app review and then after it had been through app review, changed it on the server side. So it was sort of a deceitful move. And so we’re going into court. We’re coming to tell our story. We’re going to talk about the privacy and security aspects of the store. And we’re confident in our case.

Kara Swisher
This trial is set for I think May 3, coming up.

Tim Cook
Yeah, it’s coming in a month.

Kara Swisher
So when you look at this case, one of the things is, it could be bad rules. This is what they’re trying to argue, I think, on Epic’s side, whether these rules where you take a certain cut and then, for example, Apple takes only 15% cut of Amazon’s App Store revenue for Prime Video, for example. Is there a reckoning for you all to think about changing these rules more significantly?

Tim Cook
Well, the App Store is not cast in concrete, you know? And so we’ve changed over time. And in fact, if you look at the commissions, Kara, and I would sort of reframe a bit from what you said, because the vast majority of people pay nothing. Because there’s not an interchange of a digital good, right? And so, like, 85% of people pay zero commission. And then with our recent move with small developers, developers earning less than a million dollars a year pay 15%. Well, it turns out that that’s the vast majority of developers. And then, we also have rules that say that if you have a subscription model in the second year and later years, you only pay 15% of those. And so we’ve only reduced the price over time. It’s only gone in one direction. It’s gone down. More apps were exempted. But those rules are applied equally to everyone. So you’ve mentioned Amazon getting 15%. That’s true for any kind of video streaming service that meets the guidelines of that program.

Kara Swisher
So it depends on what they’re doing — what they’re necessary —

Tim Cook
It depends on what they’re doing. Right.

Kara Swisher
Like Netflix and others, right. What’s wrong with Epic or any developer going their own way or allowing a direct payment system, instead of having to go through the App Store? Why should you have the control?

Tim Cook
Well, I think somebody has to. I think somebody has to curate, right? Because users aren’t going to come there and buy things if they don’t have trust and confidence in the store. And we think our users want that.

Kara Swisher
Why can’t there be more stores, other stores run by others?

Tim Cook
Because if you had side loading, you would break the privacy and security model.

Kara Swisher
On the phone itself, and the phone itself wouldn’t protect the user necessarily.

Tim Cook
Well, you’d be opening up a huge vector on another store.

Kara Swisher
Do you find this to be your most vulnerable part of your business, these issues with antitrust investigators looking into it?

Tim Cook
Apple has helped build a economy that’s over a half a trillion dollars a year, half a trillion, and takes a very small sliver of that for the innovation that it unleashed and the expense of running the store. I think it’s hard to argue that the App Store is not an economic miracle. I mean, you just look at it. There’s been over a million people in the U.S now have their livelihoods associated with the App Store. And they are not only selling in the United States, but they’re selling abroad. And this is one of the fastest growing job segments.

Kara Swisher
. But yet, you feel you have to have complete control over this economic miracle, or you can’t envision not having control of it?

Tim Cook
I think curation is important as a part of the App Store. In any given week, 100,000 applications come into the app review. 40,000 of them are rejected. Most of them are rejected because they don’t work or don’t work like they say that they work. You can imagine if curation went away, what would occur to the App Store in a very short amount of time.

Kara Swisher
We’ll be back in a minute. If you like this interview and want to hear others, follow us on your favorite podcast app. You’ll be able to catch up on “Sway” episodes you may have missed, like my conversation with former Parler CEO John Matze. And you’ll get new ones delivered directly to you. More with Tim Cook after the break.

You’ve acquired a lot of companies since 2015, but not big ones. Apple has still maintained it’s not in the big acquisition game. I think the last big acquisition was Beats Music and Beats Electronics in 2014 for $3 billion, which was a long time ago. Talk a little about where you think innovation is going for Apple itself.

Tim Cook
Obviously, I have a rule against talking about things in the future. But I’m very excited about AR. I’m very excited about AI.

Kara Swisher
What is your big interest in augmented reality? I remember we had lunch once, and again, you talked about football and augmented reality. That was all you talked about. So what was that? And I’m more interested in, as I told you, in augmented reality. What is the interest in it? Because Apple is holding its next Worldwide Developers Conference in June with the tagline “Glow and Behold.” I don’t know what that means. It’s rumored that Apple is expected to announce the first major new device since 2015, a mixed-reality headset. Can you talk about AR and this mixed-reality headset?

Tim Cook
Well, I can’t talk about anything that may or may not be in the pipeline. But in terms of AR, the promise of AR is that you and I are having a great conversation right now. Arguably, it could even be better if we were able to augment our discussion with charts or other things to appear. And your audience would also benefit from this, too, I think. And so when I think about that in different fields, whether it’s health, whether it’s education, whether it’s gaming, whether it’s retail, I’m already seeing AR take off in some of these areas with use of the phone. And I think the promise is even greater in the future.

Kara Swisher
So it’s a critically important part of Apple’s future.

Tim Cook
It is.

Kara Swisher
What about content? You’re in content. Why do you think you need to be in there competing against a Netflix? It seems like it’s a comma for you, like hardly any investment.

Tim Cook
Oh, no, not at all. Not at all. We’re making serious investments in Apple TV Plus. I assume you’re talking about video content.

Kara Swisher
Yeah, mm-hmm.

Tim Cook
For the same reason that we’re in products, we’re about making the best, not the most. And so in the TV Plus area, we’re about originals only on Apple. And so I don’t know if you’re watching, what you’re watching at all, but —

Kara Swisher
“The Morning Show,” just on yours. That’s all.

Tim Cook
You’re watching “The Morning Show.” I hope you love it. “Ted Lasso” — I don’t know if you’ve watched Ted Lasso.

Kara Swisher
I have.

Tim Cook
But there was no better show during COVID. I’m getting notes from a lot of different people that love it.

Kara Swisher
Right, how do you compete, though, against a Netflix? And you’ve got all these streamers, while HBO Max is making all this content. You have money. That’s what you have the most of, I think, compared to all of them.

Tim Cook
Well, hopefully, we have good ideas. But Kara, I don’t see it as a zero sum game. I don’t see that if a given user buys Netflix, that they can’t also buy Apple.

Kara Swisher
And you think content is critical as an area of focus for Apple.

Tim Cook
Yes, and we’re putting all of ourselves into it. It is not a hobby. It is not a dip your toe in. Because it’s an original focus, we don’t instantly have a catalog with 500 things in it. We’re going to build over time. We’ve gotten over 300 nominations now for awards and have won 80.

Kara Swisher
Yeah, you don’t strike me as a Hollywood guy, Tim. I don’t know.

Tim Cook
I’m not a Hollywood guy.

Kara Swisher
Yeah, I don’t see you, like, swanning around Hollywood.

Tim Cook
I’m not a Hollywood guy. But Kara, I love great content.

Kara Swisher
Mm-hmm. Last question on innovation, self-driving cars. One of the companies you acquired is Drive AI, a self-driving startup. Apple is testing autonomous vehicles. It was, reportedly. Last year, Elon Musk said he offered to sell Tesla to Apple for 1/10 its value. And he said you wouldn’t even take a meeting with him.

Tim Cook
You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon, although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built. I think Tesla has done an unbelievable job of not only establishing the lead, but keeping the lead for such a long period of time in the EV space. So I have great appreciation for them. In terms of the work that we’re doing there, obviously, I’m going to be a little coy on that. The autonomy itself is a core technology, in my view. If you sort of step back, the car, in a lot of ways, is a robot. An autonomous car is a robot. And so there’s lots of things you can do with autonomy. And we’ll see what Apple does. We investigate so many things internally. Many of them never see the light of day. I’m not saying that one will not.

Kara Swisher
Would it be in the form of a car or the technology within a car?

Tim Cook
Yeah, I’m not going to answer that question.

Kara Swisher
I think it has to be a car. You can’t just do the tech — you’re not going to let — you’re not Google.

Tim Cook
We love to integrate hardware, software, and services, and find the intersection points of those because we think that’s where the magic occurs. And so that’s what we love to do. And we love to own the primary technology that’s around that.

Kara Swisher
I’m going to go with car for that, if you don’t mind. I’m going to just jump to car. I wish you would make a car. I actually have been looking at electric cars and autonomous cars. Anyway, one of the things I want to finish up is you yourself in your sort of evolution, but politically, too, you were talking about voting rights, about the issues in Georgia. You did engage with Trump a lot. I didn’t call you “Tim Apple” once. Do you miss that, by the way?

Tim Cook
Being called “Tim Apple“?

Kara Swisher
Yeah.

Tim Cook
I changed my Twitter handle to “Tim Apple” for a while. So I leaned into it.

Kara Swisher
You leaned into it. And you just didn’t correct him. You just thought, why not? Why not just let him do it? How do you look at working with the Biden administration versus the Trump administration? Because you’ve become more political, I think.

Tim Cook
I don’t feel political. I feel that we focus on policies. And we believe strongly in an engagement. So whoever is in the White House, we’re going to seek to engage. And we’re going to seek to find areas of commonality where we can help the administration. And there will be areas that I’m sure that we are on different sides of an issue as well. But our focus is not on the politics of it. It’s on the policy. And so that’s what we did during President Trump’s administration. That’s what we’ll do during President Biden’s administration.

Kara Swisher
Talk about voting rights and what you said.

Tim Cook
Yeah, well, voting rights, I think voting rights are fundamental to democracy. You know, I think about my old friend, John Lewis. And sort of what John did to advance voting rights and the hard-fought wins there, we can’t let those go in reverse. And I think, just from a stepping back from it, I think we’re probably all having the wrong conversation on voting rights. We should be talking about using technology. How can we make it so simple that our voting participation gets to 100? Or it gets really close to 100. Maybe we get in the 90s or something. It’s pretty arcane.

Kara Swisher
Certainly, but when you introduce technology into voting when it’s already fraught with accusations of fraud, it’s sort of a really troublesome stew, politically speaking.

Tim Cook
I’m not sure. It may answer some of the issues. It may be something that is so different than the current —

Kara Swisher
So voting on phones? Is that what you’re talking about?

Tim Cook
You know, I would dream of that, because I think that’s where we live. We do our banking on phones. We have our health data on phones. We have more information on a phone about us than is in our houses. And so why not?

Kara Swisher
Well, it’s been a little politicized at this point. I mean, it’s interesting you’re saying policy versus politics, but you’re in the middle of politics right now. Are there any negatives to moving into the political space from your perspective as a modern CEO?

Tim Cook
It’s not something I want to do. The way that I look at it is, we want to advance some of our policies. We want to advance immigration. We want to advance on working on climate change. We want to advance job creation. We want to advance retraining because we see the need to retrain over a lifetime. And we want to find the administrations or representatives that believe in those things and work with them on those. It’s not really working against somebody. It’s working for those causes.

Kara Swisher
Is there a cost to a CEO inserting themselves in?

Tim Cook
Inserting themselves in policy? Oh, every time I say something, somebody will reach out to me and not be very happy.

Kara Swisher
Right, or not — or be very happy.

Tim Cook
Yeah.

Kara Swisher
You decided to come out in 2014 in a Bloomberg piece. I can’t believe you didn’t come to Kara Swisher, but that’s OK. That’s all right. I’m forgiving you. And you’re the first openly gay CEO of a Fortune 500 company. Do you feel the need to be an even louder voice now or a more prominent leader in this area? You just teamed up with non-profit Encircle to donate a million dollars. You’re serving as honorary co-chair.

Tim Cook
The way that I looked at this was I wanted to speak my truth because I saw kids struggling with who they were and maybe being disowned by their families, maybe being bullied — a set of horribles, if you will. And I felt that coming out and speaking my truth would help show them that there was a light at the end of the tunnel; that they could rise and do things incredible in life, that they were not capped in some kind of way because they were part of the LGBTQ community. And I feel like — well, I know because I’ve gotten so many different notes and people reaching out to me over time — that I accomplished that for a number of people. And I feel really good about that. I don’t feel like that’s all I need to do. I think to whom much is given, much is required. And so I’m going to continue. Encircle is a great example. I don’t know if you’re familiar with that organization.

Kara Swisher
I am. They build homes.

Tim Cook
But they build homes. They have kids that come to these homes. They have programs built around. It’s a safe place to be. I think that program is scalable. And so we want to help that in any way that we can. And I’m going to speak out on laws and regulations that pop up that are discriminatory to the community.

Kara Swisher
What about Arkansas? Arkansas has passed a bill allowing doctors to refuse to treat LGBTQ patients. How do you look at issues like this?

Tim Cook
This is, everybody should be treated with dignity and respect. If you go in to a doctor, they should treat you. I’m surprised we’re even having to say that. It’s disappointing.

Kara Swisher
Yeah. Are you worried?

Tim Cook
I’m worried that there seems to be more of a move afoot in a number of states in this front, uh, very focused on transgender and then some focused on the broader community. And I think this encroachment needs to stop.

Kara Swisher
All right, so 10 years. Are you going to be at Apple 10 more years?

Tim Cook
10 more years, I probably not. But I can tell you that I feel great right now. And the date’s not in sight. But 10 more years is a long time and probably not 10 more years.

Kara Swisher
What would you do if you weren’t running Apple?

Tim Cook
I don’t have a clue, because I love this company so much, that it’s hard to imagine my life without it.

Kara Swisher
Right.

Tim Cook
And so I don’t think I will know that until after I’m not here. Because I think I’ll run so fast that I’ll never really think about it until I’m not running anymore. Does that make any sense?

Kara Swisher
Maybe just go on vacation.

Tim Cook
[LAUGHS]

Kara Swisher
Something like that. All right, Tim, thank you so much.

Tim Cook
Kara, it was great talking with you. Good seeing you.

Kara Swisher
All right, bye.

Tim Cook
Bye-bye. [MUSIC PLAYING]

as a former auto journo & also longtime iJustine fan, I’d just like to express my full support & enthusiasm about automakers finally realizing they should have been treating y'all tech youtubers as real tech journos this whole time. I know there's some bitterness about it from legacy auto media (which I understand but lament,) but it's very important for all of us to take this opportunity to *discuss how we can work together* toward a better future for the whole industry spectrum. 

also, 

FLEX!! 👏 🙌 🔥🔥
# Engagement RE: Jessica Lessin on attribution and perception

"[Why Media Brands Aren't Dead](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/why-media-brands-arent-dead?eu=2hSdiCtqrT1mBm2v93IlhA&utm_source=ti_app)" | _The Information_

A slight addendum: while I think we (folks who are professionally, emotionally, or even recreationally invested and engaged with the media industry) should proceed under the assumption that readers are intelligent and discerning, the reality (as I have observed, living and working among working-class Midwesterners) is quite different. We know this, already, but specifically regarding **bylines**… From what I have observed in the wild, the majority of casual news consumers rarely if ever notice them. As far as they're concerned, anything they happen to read on the new york times dot com, or from their various social accounts, is most definitely written in the voice of *the brand*.

Obviously, much has been said on this issue by meta media authorities here and elsewhere, but the disconnect remains glaring and alarming from where I sit. 

I vaguely remember a conversation I had with a partner on this subject when I was attempting to build a unique digital media company circa 2017: We were tossing very *technical*, UX-ey design solutions around. As in the CSS style of the byline element on an article's webpage… We dropped it, but I think it's worth thinking about **visually reengineering our methodologies of attribution**.  

also worth considering: uploading to youtube even if you are audio-only. I could’ve sworn youtube briefly allowed users to just straight upload audio files, but my YouTuber friend just corrected me on Twitter (apparently not) so I might be delirious.

I do know that it was possible - even explicitly supported for a good while - to embed YouTube as an audio player with HTML, but isn''t anymore. 

you can find various custom workflows folks have developed that take audio files and render them to a video with a static image in a way that's relatively frugal, bandwidth-wise.

I know this point in tech/media is basically the *well, you might as well do it* era because of exponentially improved network/GPU speeds, but we're going to have to reckon with the environmental consequences of all our bandwidth pretty soon and… idk…

last thing: as someone who's listened to podcasts since the internet radio days that I have no desire to see video of the process, nor would actually watching fit in any of the different day-to-day contexts in which I consume them. I would rather creators enjoy the little freedoms that come from audio-only (recording in sweatpants among a few other perks).
# David Blue on Vine: The Platinum Collection

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/350714498?autoplay=1&color=ff401a&title=0&byline=0&portrait=0" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Yes, I am still managing to waste my time digging up and re-arranging some *very* old content, but I just couldn't resist. Somehow, it didn't occur to me until yesterday evening that I could sort through the original video files of my old vines fairly easily in fucking Google Photos and blast them through iMovie for iOS into a full montage relatively easily. 

Some of these are very cringey... 

Yes, I'd love to finally get around to my ultimate romantic editorialization on that most dearly departed social network, but things are way too jumbled right now, obviously.
