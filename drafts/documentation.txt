* [x] Relative link to messages that don't involve complex scripting.
* [x] Unlimited file upload limit - **2GB PER FILE LIMIT**.
* [x] Cross-platform as all fuck.
* [ ] Every programming/scripting language ever has at least a few (probably unfinished and abandoned) projects in the wild building support for Telegram APIs.
* [x] Drafts as a safe dependable space to compose text does not have a windows equivalent, but Telegram can sort of function in that regard, largely because it continuously saves what one types in the text field. 
* [ ] Element … or Matrix… or whatever the actual protocol is called… is nothing but a great way to waste your time and the planet’s energy in obfuscating willy nilly. 
* [ ] Perhaps I should have accepted long ago that my particular priorities are *not* as resonant with other users as I would like to believe.
* [ ] Notification management in Telegram as well considered as I’ve ever experienced, which makes a lot of sense now that I am a long time user.
* [x] When I lost all my shit in Portland, much of what was saved was thanks to Telegram.
* [ ] The particular features that define Telegram’s competence are not immediately obvious, for the most part. Being able to quickly change the recipient of a forwarded message, for instance,
* [ ] Telegram is notably lacking in translation support considering it's such an international space.
* [ ] Microsoft Teams needs to be considered as an alternative since it's being so heavily emphasized for *personal use* in Windows 11.
* [x] The **cost** of Telegram vs. Discord Nitro, now.
* [ ] [[SI on Discord Regarding Objective-C and Swift]]
* [ ] "Last seen within a week will be kicked."
* [ ] As far as I’m concerned/as far as I live, now, Telegram is a required utility for using iOS.
* [ ] The ever-greater value of the ability to [**send silent messages**](https://telegram.org/blog/channels-2-0#silent-messages).

> A single boost costs $4.99 a month, and any member of the Discord Server can contribute. If you’re a Discord Nitro subscriber, you get a 30% discount on all Discord Server Boost purchases. Recently, Discord introduced lower thresholds for upgrading Discord Server Levels. Before, it takes 15 server boosts to achieve Level 2, and 30 server boosts to reach Level 3. But in a recent update, it will now only take 7 server boosts to reach Level 2, and 14 boosts to reach Level 3. That’d be a total of $34.93 for Level 2 and $69.86 for Level 3. That’s $24.45 for Level 2 and $48.90 for Level 3 for Nitro subscribers.

## How my particular

It’s been three years since I first discovered iPhone-bound personal automation in a late build from iOS 12’s *Public* Beta channel, having skipped pout on the entire cycle for the first release in a good while. I’d been more occupied than ever before with my failing attempt to move myself and *Extratone* to the West Coast, and my news consumption was more focused than ever on *media* instead of consumer technology. Somehow I missed not only the news of [Workflow’s acquisition by Apple](https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-acquires-workflow/,) the previous Spring, but its hasty, surprisingly [well-covered](https://www.macstories.net/stories/shortcuts-a-new-vision-for-siri-and-ios-automation/) (by *MacStories*, anyway) “adaptation” of most(?) of their application’s extensive GUI-based script builder into the Shortcuts app, associated with Apple’s voice assistant as an “end around for the problems with Siri,” [as suggested by Dieter Bohn](https://pca.st/episode/9d2ada21-dc11-41a4-b000-1aefcdd641ca?t=361.0) along with the lion’s share of greater tech media supposition.

# Min Discord

Hello Min folks! I haven’t been so excited to find out about a project’s Discord server launch in a long time! 

If I’m not mistaken, Min’s developers live in Missouri? Don’t want to make anyone uncomfortable, but I live in Columbia, MO, and would basically love the opportunity to frame it as …. not like “grass roots software,” or anything… idk. I guess I would like to think the fact that Min’s developmental priorities make so much more sense (for my own use, yes, but also for the average user’s) than any other web browser I’ve ever encountered might have something to do with its creators’ distance from the Wacky Fantasy World on the West Coast. 

anywho, I’m David Blue and I’ve put off writing about Min for far too long. very glad to be here.

I also wanted to say:

I’ve taken the opportunity provided by a membership discount to give 1Password a chance again (which is not going well, in case you were wondering lol,) so I took a sec to try out your integration with it last night… and my god… utterly genius. notably the most abstracted installation/integration with a CLI I’ve ever seen, generally, which is. incredible because it actually works!! (so far.) just makes everybody else’s insistence on using browser extensions to accomplish this look utterly daft lmao

# SI on Discord Regarding Objective-C and Swift

* [Original Post](https://discord.com/channels/836622115435184162/837345707395907635/898349119725269053)

In the case of Tweetbot and Drafts, they have been around long enough that they simply were originally written in Objective-C (because Swift wasn’t a thing yet) - but they both contain some parts in Swift (especially Drafts).

It’s important to note that Swift, Objective-C and C are interoperable, meaning you can use them together without much effort. So it doesn’t really matter (though a well written purely C app will probably perform better than a well written Swift app, but writing a well written C app is harder)

This isn’t the case with other languages, like for example JavaScript, since it requires a JavaScript engine (written in C, probably) to run the code. That’s also the reason why Electron apps usually use more resources, etc.

> hey thank you! I did not know that regular C was also tossed into the mix. I suppose I was asking under the narrative context of iOS’ transition to Swift from  Objective-C. when I asked the Tapbots guys about whether or not Tweetbot was written in Objective-C, they responded as if there was no other way for them… as if Swift is icky. idk I could have misinterpreted.
> I was also under the impression that Tweetbot 6 was entirely rewritten from scratch… in Objective-C. which seems like a very opinionated choice.

You’re welcome ☺️ Happy to share my knowledge <:goodstat:879872135068262401> Different developers have different preferences and usually care deeply about the way they like to work - so it’s very possible you interpreted them correctly 😅

Even if it was rewritten from scratch in Objective-C, it’s not purely Objective-C, since the widgets for example can only be written in Swift (and SwiftUI, not UIKit)
# Windows 11 Family Message

So Windows 11 updates are going to be available starting *tomorrow*! I’ve been playing with it on and off for much of this year but there’s not too much to say other than… beneath the few flash features (trying widgets again, better desktop zones, a new look all-around,) Microsoft really did invest time in actually fixing/smoothing out stuff to an extent that - in my opinion, at least - a much smoother, more robust feeling Windows *is* the headline feature.

The one thing I’d note - they’re relaunching their store as the “Microsoft Store,” and it’s going to be pretty well saturated with scammy paid apps. I would STRONGLY suggest ultra-hesitance before spending any money on the new store. The vast majority of the legitimate applications (including an Alexa app, which I have yet to try) are completely free - you shouldn’t even need to set up billing information to download them. If you do find a paid app that looks worth it, make sure you verify the publisher is legit both within the store *and* on the publisher’s website. 

Notably, **I will literally do this for you any time**. It’s not knowledge-heavy work, or anything, but it can be tedious. It’d be a bonus if you could share prospective software with me here so that others can refer back in the future.

I don’t think any of you have any Windows-running computers old enough for their Windows 11 eligibility to be in question, but let me know if you do and I’ll check.

If you’re like me and hate system update prompts just appearing out of the blue, I’ll do my best to let you know as soon as it becomes available in the Windows Update settings menu in Windows 10. When that time comes, all you’ll need to do is start a search for “update” or “windows update” in the Start menu and the only result should be the right one. From there, using the `Check for updates` button should get the process started, though it might take a while.
# ColumbiaMO Telegram Chat Rules

*Version 1.0 - 2021-10-02-20.15.17*

Hello, chat! I’ve finally drafted a presentable copy of the Big Bad Chat Rules.

You can find a revision-tracked version of this document on the GitHub repo I created, [here](https://github.com/extratone/columbia/blob/main/rules.md).

1. **ColumbiaMO Local Chat** is a place to discuss current events and culture in a friendly, collegial way. We invite you to be smart, kind, welcoming, funny, charming, incisive, prescient, skeptical: whoever you are on your best day.
2. **ColumbiaMO Local Chat** is reserved for people who live, have lived, or intend to live in mid-Missouri as well as travelers through the area. 
3. Share news, opinions, personal experiences, charts, data, photos, tweets, and other media. Do not share misinformation, disinformation, or spam — including in DMs to other members.
4. Do not promote your own hustles — or your clients’ hustles — more than **once per day**.
5. Disruptive off-topic posts (random interjections) are discouraged and unwelcome.
6. Discuss subjects in good faith. Do not troll, mock, or harass other members of the community.
7. Pseudonyms are welcome, and you do not have to disclose where you work, but do not impersonate anyone.
8. Keep it safe for work. **ColumbiaMO Local Chat** is not the place for disturbing images, racy pictures, or anything else you wouldn’t want to share with your coworkers or family.
9. Be inclusive of all people and points of view. This is particularly true for Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and people in the LBGTQ+ community. We will remove any homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, or racist content without discussion.
10. If someone is bothering you or you would like to report a post or member who you believe is violating these rules, please contact one of the Administrators or Moderators.
11. Final moderation decisions are subject to the whims of the Admins and Mods.
12. We expect to update these rules as necessary. When we do, you’ll see a notification attached to this message.
13. Follow the spirit of these rules as well as the letter of them. Do not become an edgelord. We err on the side of removing borderline content — and borderline users — from the channel.
# Highlights x Hypothes.is Feedback

so this is a big stretch, but I thought I’d mention it considering my doing so in the Command Browser Discord seemed to provoke a somewhat-constructive discussion.

there’s a service called *Hypothesis* (https://web.hypothes.is) which has been my personal favorite attempt to create a universal “social annotation” service. they’ve got browser extensions but are (imo) in serious need of *any* support on iOS/iPadOS. I’m not a developer, but from what I can deduce, it looks like their APIs are well-documented and just waiting for an auspicious developer to come along and utilize.

I know I would personally *kill* for a smoother method of using Hypothesis on my iPhone…

just a thought.

## [SYSTEM COLORS Telegram Themes](https://telegra.ph/SYSTEM-COLORS-Themes-for-iOS-Bound-Telegram-09-27)

Make no mistake - I did virtually nothing to create the following themes, nor do I know anything about Telegram theme development, generally. Frankly, I shouldn’t have even taken the time to whip *these* up, but I wanted to at least dip my toe in the experience for [a strangely sentimental essay I’ve been working on](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/issues/228) about the service’s service in my working life.

https://t.me/extratone/6496

The one thing I *did* do is track down the most accurate translation of [iOS’ core system colors](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/ios/visual-design/color/) in hex I could find, which I spammed in each reasonably-generateable format all over every dead end group chat and channel I once created and have (shamefully) subsequently neglected and forgotten on this service.

```
--color-pink: #ff2d55;
--color-purple: #5856d6;
--color-orange: #ff9500;
--color-yellow: #ffcc00;
--color-red: #ff3b30;
--color-teal-blue: #5ac8fa;
--color-blue: #007aff;
--color-green: #4cd964;
```

I originally started using the [Big Boy Editor](https://themes.contest.com) and immediately realized that there is no apparent means of translating the iOS themes I’d found recently into .tdesktop themes without 1.) implementing an unofficial, but highly tedious translation matrix between the entirely different formats, or just 2.) fuckin eyeballing it.

* [SYSTEM RED](https://t.me/addtheme/systemred)
* [SYSTEM GREEN](https://t.me/addtheme/systemgreen)
* [SYSTEM ORANGE](https://t.me/addtheme/systemorange)

I started with [perhaps the best light theme for this app I’ve ever found](https://t.me/addtheme/tgbetacore) in terms of ultimate legibility in blinding sunlight, loading its (apparently early iOS-inspired?) style as a duplicate in the Bitch Mode “editor” found within the iOS app, itself. Then, I simply replaced its singular hex color asset with the equivalents you see above in the three classes to which it was assigned…

# Safari Tab Groups Idea

An idea for a useful configurable behavior in Safari: **assigned default bookmark folders per Tab Group**. 

As in, when in one’s Technology News category, they might configure it so that trigging the Add Bookmark dialogue with `⌘ + D` has their “Tech” bookmark folder selected by default.
# Circling Back to Tweetbot 6.3

![Harvest Theme - Tweetbot 6.3](https://i.snap.as/3Q0YFS3h.png)

## As the increasingly haphazard work of native Twitter software collapses around us, let us recognize yet again Tapbots’ sure footing.

No, I can’t quite believe it, either, but I am investing *two whole*, precious items in this feed to a single application in the same calendar year.

# Circling Back to Tweetbot 6.3

![Harvest Theme - Tweetbot 6.3](https://i.snap.as/3Q0YFS3h.png)

Several weeks ago, after finally taking the taking the time to explore the modernizations shipped with TweetBot 6.2 [in mid-August](https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/17/tweetbot-6-2-update-timeline-widgets-multiple-windows-support-ipad), it occurred to me that it might be an ideal time to follow up on a brief exchange I’d had with Tapbots support in mid-February concerning a single, single key Bluetooth keyboard shortcut, ultimately - using the F key to favorite (and now `Shift + ⌘ + L` to “like”) which then seemed to have been lost in the transition from Tweetbot 5 to Tweetbot 6. If you’ll recall from [my first stupidly time-consuming big Post of 2021](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review), our conversation was left open ended with “thanks, we’ll take a look at these.” You might also recall a very specific pledge of mine which I just rediscovered:

> Without being verbose, I’ll just tell you that if a near future update to the app fixes the `F` and `⌘ + R` shortcuts, I 𝒲ℐℒℒ shit out my whole ass.

The amount I’d learned about iPhone History and its operating system’s coinciding development in the since this exchange felt absolutely ginormous… So frighteningly great was it to behold, that I actually included a lame suggestion in my reply, that it might have *something* to do with Objective C vs. SwiftUI (god y’all are so cliquey though,) in what I also decided would be the last time I bothered them about it. 

![Second Email to Tapbots](https://i.snap.as/SRNCTVev.png)

Just *twenty-one* minutes later:

![Tapbots Reply](https://i.snap.as/r663eKgV.png)

Naturally… They were 100% correct… I just somehow managed to skip the crucial step of actually *trying the shortcuts in the app* before reaching out. Very likely the least competent behavior possible from *The iPhone Hardware Keyboard Guy*, yeah? 

https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1427679138572390400

Anyway, though their spare release notes don’t mention it, the Tapbots guys obviously hooked a keyboard up to an iPhone recently. I’m actually not quite sure how many of these I missed before, but using the `R` key to Retweet, `Q` to Quote Tweet, and `L` to like have all been re-implemented. (You’ll need to confirm Retweets with the `Return` key.)

# iOS 15 Reviewed for My Family

![iOS 15 is Not His Year](https://i.snap.as/X3rV4nPq.png)

## It's been a tough summer for the *Always Feature-Focused* Tribe.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/106/928/540/559/240/957/original/664eede6fbba4c53.mp3">
</audio>

Eighty days ago, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering ~~stood up in front of a crowd of~~... 

No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother’s basement, on a Monday morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of the Apple community’s unbelievably unreserved, almost *spiritual* volume of **pure hype** from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage. (Hilariously, *all* of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in 2015 and [kept comparing to Slack](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison), but like an actual madman.)

Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:

> For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...

I’m dwelling on them because they are **patently meaningless**. Very little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call *ease-of-use-centric*. Some of it - namely controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari - feels almost maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of [**the full feature list**](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/) are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

![The Foundation Image](https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png)

This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone’s billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig *should* be referring to with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or “end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a *utilitarian* device, above all else. They don’t have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn them off. Realistically, they don’t even have time to read this whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.) 

Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users’ devices over the Find My network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple Maps’ live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.

![Testing Home Screens for iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/eBBnwCIn.png)

What I *will* dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple’s automation knows better than us users when something should happen or change. A great example: using [a simple Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c) to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead of trusting the [unnecessarily complex conditions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086) of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons. 

Quite simply, the more automated iOS has become, the less comfortably in control I have felt. For myself, at least, every single functional automation Apple has introduced has drastically failed to simplify my own using life, and the vast majority have in fact complicated it dramatically. Apple-adjacent publications and greater tech media have ceased all-out criticism and instead resorted to justifying and explaining (or attempting to, anyway) just about all of Apple’s subtle retractions of user control over the years, but apparently, I am too much of a control freak to let it go. I have been here since the very beginning, have bitched loudly all along, and do not plan to go quietly into that automated night. This theme pervades throughout this review, so for any of you who *do* feel like iOS’ automations fit comfortably into your life, please keep this in mind. 

![Safari Settings in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/oHqejXq1.png)

## The Gist

Rounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode immediately after installing iOS 15, you’ll notice that Notifications and other elements have had their rounded corners *further* rounded, for some reason. Assuming Safari ships with its new look turned on by default, the screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to change) where one can switch it off. (Your best bet is to visit [**its menu in Settings**](prefs:root=SAFARI) as displayed on the right in `Settings ⇨ Safari`.) As of this writing, at least two of iOS 15’s “headlining” features have been pushed to further iterative updates: [SharePlay](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/ios-15-apple-shareplay-tv-delay-b1904548.html) and [iCloud Private Relay](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/). I suspect you will be prompted to explore Focus Modes upon initial installation, which I will eventually analyze in relative detail. Ideally, you’ll also be prompted to explore “Shared With You,” which I personally believe to be the release’s most significant addition for most people, by far. 

As far as "meaningful ways iPhone could help you," I see little more than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not so complex to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this moment) a pretty hopeless implementation of a theoretically useful concept. Some additional filters in Apple Maps search will prove useful so long as the associated metadata has been updated for locations *other* than San Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.) Optical Character (text) Recognition has been implemented “system wide” under the feature Apple terms “Live Text,” and translation has finally been extended to the places where it’s most useful (think: Safari.) 

In general, though, most of what’s coming with iOS 15 has little real value in the day-to-day experience for most iPhone users. A complete inversion of Craig’s phrase feels significantly more accurate: *This year, we were inspired to create even more superficial ways iPhone could temporarily dazzle tech media*. 

And now, I’d like to take you through what I feel are the considerations I’d like my family to know - namely my 70-year-old mother, who depends 100% on her iPhone and MacBook Pro every day to run her private practice - but also my ~8 nieces and nephews spanning 6th grade-graduate school, who all - if I’m not mistaken - have iPhones.

```markdown
Worthy of note: this “review” is very heavily focused on *iOS* - which is to say *iPhone* - to the point where any overlap with iPadOS/MacOS/WatchOS/HomeOS/any other goddamned operating system is purely coincidental. For coverage of those changes, please seek your regular sources.
```

![Shared With You - Photos App in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/5otqrdNU.png)

## Photos

### Shared With You

The single most important/welcome feature addition to iOS 15 for most people, I believe, is found in Apple’s native Photos app and entitled **Shared With You**. This view - found in the second tab in the bottom navigation row (“For You”) - is a reverse-chronological timeline of every bit of media (photos & videos) you’ve ever been sent over iMessage. For those with a lot of iOS-using friends (unlike myself,) I would imagine the list will take quite a while to populate. 

### Memories

I find Alex Guyot’s bit on changes to Memories (from [his iOS 15 overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/)) much more concise than what I’d written, so here it is almost in full:

> Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple Music, and can be customized with color filters. Setting different filters will result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on Memories videos.  

> While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn’t transition away. The song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically altered to match back up with the song’s beat.  

> If you don’t want to go with the song that was chosen automatically, you can tap the new Music button to get a pop-up interface into Apple Music, allowing you to choose a song manually. This interface will include smart suggestions for other songs that Apple thinksd you’ll like which would also fit the vibe of your video.  

https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg

Yeah. I hope you’re at least half as amused as I have continued to be by algorithmic video generation. [The above result](https://youtu.be/7uFR_bSxhTg) was created with absolutely zero modification from an album of images and videos which Photos automatically created via face recognition. The only other coherent option from my own limited set of photos is really the only one that matters, I think you'll agree. "Pet Friends" yielded [inevitably uplifting results](https://youtu.be/-1bA7-oslkc) in all three of my test renders, but - given a crop of cute dog photos - little intelligence is necessary to produce.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1bA7-oslkc

If you're experiencing any sort of Déjà vu from the idea of auto-generated slideshows with rights-free soundtracks in the Photos app, it's because Apple has made several distinct attempts to implement very similar iterations of the feature throughout iPhone's history, which has involved iMovie on iOS and MacOS once or twice. I have fiddled with every one - including iOS 15's - and my (truly sound and original) advice is to **avoid spending time trying to customize auto-generated videos** in general. If you explore one of the suggested Memories and find the software's default result satisfactory, of course you should save it, but be wary of any attempts to take editorial control yourself.

![Visual Lookup Indicator in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/74HOlnLP.png)

### Visual Lookup

Perhaps the most unjustifiable background use of your phone’s resources introduced in iOS 15, “Visual Lookup,” seeks to identify “popular art and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers out in nature, books, and breeds of pets” present in your photos so that you might… identify them more swiftly(?) The only means of distinguishing photos on which Visual Lookup has been applied is to look for the modified ⓘ symbol at the very bottom of your screen in the photo browsing view (see the screenshot embedded above.) As you might notice in the screenshots *below*, not one of its analyses on my own images was usably accurate. 

The decision to target the feature on identifying domesticated pets, specifically, is more universalizing than historic landmarks, for sure, but it also immediately sets up the technology (at least this preview of it) for failure.  

![Visual Lookup in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/AtxzN45h.png)

### Metadata

Hooray! You can now view an image's basic details in the "Info pane," by swiping up on an image or using the ⓘ button. This includes the extension (type) and size of the image file, camera identification and configuration details, and -  as part of Shared With You - from whom/where you got the image. Bizarrely, the "Adjust" tool also lets you alter a given image's timestamp and location information. While I can imagine infinitely many reasons why you'd want to *omit* or *delete* such information, I cannot conceive of a single wholesome reason why one would chose to *change* it, instead. 

![Photo Stacks in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/93BGmX4I.png)

### Messages

Just a few weeks shy of [iMessage's tenth birthday](https://web.archive.org/web/20120308031950/https://www.apple.com/ios/features.html), Apple has finally added a button to save incoming photos directly in Messages conversations. It's about as blatant as Apple interface design gets - you'll spot it opposite others' images. Tapping it saves the appropriate photo(s) directly to the Recents folder before a silly animation vanishes the button itself.

Once again, from Mr. Guyot:

> Groups of photos that you send will now be shown as stacks instead of in a long list, allowing you to more easily swipe through the images without losing track of the conversation around them. Tap on a stack to open a grid view where you can see and select multiple photos at once.  

I took the screenshot embedded above in iOS 15 Developer Beta 5, and… Do “stacks” not look hilariously janky as fuck? 

![Live Text in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/DNJOKq85.png)

### Live Text

For someone like myself, iOS 15’s system-wide integration of Optical Character Recognition is undoubtedly its most useful addition by far. Throughout the Developer Beta, it’s moved up this list gradually as I’ve come to see how it could be useful for *you*, as well. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3kj0-q4k9k

The [video embedded above](https://youtu.be/y3kj0-q4k9k) is a very rough demo, but I suspect it’s more “authentic” than most you’d see elsewhere. The ability to *accurately* capture text right from the camera is invaluable, but for most folks, *line breaks* are going to be a real problem. I’m working on a way to address this with a Siri Shortcut, which I’ll obviously share here when/if I succeed. 

## Audio

https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhxtfW0taIY

### Background Sounds

My eldest sister has used a sound/noise machine to sleep for as long as I can remember, so I was especially excited to show her iOS 15’s native “Background Sounds” feature, but she was distinctly unimpressed, noting that her iPhone-based sound generation needs were well met by third-party apps she’d already discovered.[^1] I didn’t have time to try out her recommendations, but I’m going to assume they aren’t able to operate “behind” *additional* audio playback like the “new” native feature is.

![Background Sounds Interrupt Remedy](https://i.snap.as/SGQt93K4.png)

My personal (hopefully insightful) anecdote: Background Sounds appear to be impervious from the audio interruption issues iOS has struggled with since its origin, which makes them a partial remedy to the discomfort of sudden, unexpected silence when using headphones with active noise cancellation. As configured in the screenshot embedded above (the menu found in `Settings ⇨ Accessibility ⇨ Audio/Visual ⇨ Background Sounds`) - with “Use When Media Is Playing” toggled `OFF`- your selected Background Sound *should* fade in when normal playback from another app is interrupted.[^2] 

### “Spatial Audio”

Just to be clear, I strongly believe that normal users should basically ignore all mention of Apple’s “Spatial Audio” (read: don’t worry about it) for a few reasons, most of which aren’t all that interesting. Since [one of my very first written works on tech](https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback) was/is directly related to the subject, though, indulge me for just a moment for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note that only two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms you’ve certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are) are necessary for audio to become “spatial.” If you’re curious about this, [my favorite all-time web experience from *The Pudding*](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/) is an absolutely impeccable next destination. Secondly, the actual technology behind Apple’s title was not developed by Apple, but by Dolby. It’s not that Apple doesn’t acknowledge this thoroughly in [their explainer docs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182), nor is Dolby by any means a wee organization in need of my amplification, but this is one of those Apple habits that’s become a particular peev. If you’re interested, [here is the actual spec sheet for Dolby Atmos in PDF](https://professional.dolby.com/siteassets/cinema-products---documents/dolby-atmos-specifications.pdf).

![Control Center Decibel Meter](https://i.snap.as/1vGTW0Iz.png)

If you happen to have either AirPods Pro or AirPods Max devices, an iPhone 7 or later, *and* an Apple Music subscription, you might want to disregard my cynicism at least long enough to try "[dynamic head tracking](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182)."

### SharePlay

*The Verge*’s Chaim Gartenburg did [an excellent - if a bit precocious - job of explaining](https://www.theverge.com/22577178/shareplay-how-to-apple-facetime-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-apple-tv-video-music) what he describes as iOS 15’s “headline feature,” called SharePlay:

> It’s a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends and family while video chatting.  

In my opinion, SharePlay represents one of those great, well-thought solutions to some notably youth-specific challenges which nobody (even the youth) will see as more worthwhile than their own. By that I mean, one ear bud per person… now, an ancient tradition. I’ve deprioritized it, in contrast to Chaim, because I’d bet it’s also one of those things one can only learn themselves.

![Notifications in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/TFWvW1b6.png)

## Notifications, Focus, and Attention

Yes, notifications have gotten *even rounder still* for some reason in iOS 15. Contact photos and “larger app icons” also “make them easier to identify,” according to Apple. (This is the one point in my whole writing life where the phrase *well I’ll be the judge of that!* is 100% valid and applicable.) There’s also a new feature called **Notification Summary** which is an absolutely useless and unnecessary complication, at least at the moment. Honestly, the one bit of solid advice from [*The Social Dilemma*](https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma) was… Just turn all Notifications off, or at least as many as possible. Notifications Summary feels like a near direct response to that one goddamned film, and its new Focus Modes do even more so.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=YZCx-9wF3ow

### Focus(es)

The most glaringly standout parallel between Microsoft’s Windows 11 release (which I have also been beta testing much less dutifully for most of this year) and Apple’s stated goals in iOS 15’s design centers around the design supposition that maximum malleability of the “spaces” in which one dwells on their operating system - namely, the “desktop(s)” and/or “home screen(s)” - lends toward a more healthy digital occupancy of them, especially in terms of attention. Unfortunately, both of them chose respective solutions which - from my view, anyway - **add complexity** more than anything.

[*The Verge*’s guide](https://www.theverge.com/22665196/ios-15-focus-modes-custom-icons-widgets-how-to) frames Focus as a customization feature to be used in tandem with [custom app icons](https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change) to fiddle your way into your own *bespoke iPhone experience*. I could be wrong, but I suspect very few among my family will find the time investment required worth the end result, but we’ll see.

![Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/mxwVtN7p.png)

I chose to embed [Matt Birchler’s guide to Focus](https://youtu.be/YZCx-9wF3ow) above because it’s by far the most succinct and helpful video I’ve yet seen on iOS 15, generally, and demonstrates how a working person might actually use Focus. My one addendum to this (and any other Focus) guide: **proceed *without* the automated bits** by avoiding anything under the `TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY` subsection of the menu. For whatever reason, location-based automation triggers on iPhone, especially, have literally **never** functioned usefully (or *reliably*) in my experience. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40y7iLdfOnM

## Maps & CarPlay

(I *am* going to do a bit of editorializing on this subject, specifically.) If the video embedded above is confusing, know that it's a very insular joke - over six years ago, in [my video review of the Nissan Juke NISMO](https://bit.ly/JukeHonk), I praised its integrated navigation screen specifically for its frugality. 

> I'm not old. I don't need a gigantic nav screen. I don't need to see a 3D rendition of the whole Earth and my position relative to it.

...and yet, a playful, exploratory experience is what Apple has in mind for Maps, apparently. Here's their description of the new "Interactive globe" feature:

> Discover the natural beauty of Earth with a rich and interactive 3D globe, including significantly enhanced details for mountain ranges, deserts, forests, oceans, and more.

In the footnotes, it’s explained that the feature will only be available on "iPhone with A12 Bionic or later," meaning the iPhone X range, basically, which makes sense considering the extent of animation and touch manipulation technology present in this view. It’s an entertaining plaything, but not much more, which is strange and frustrating. If I could gather the usage statistics across all my family’s iPhones, how much time would you suppose they’ve spent in Apple Maps to date *screwing around* as opposed to *searching and navigating*? 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1437519482428272641

Put another way - Apple’s developmental direction for Apple Maps as a service seems distinctly toward a travel/entertainment application (notably, like [Google Earth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097),) instead of a utilitarian navigation app (like [Google Maps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354), [Waze](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106), or [MapQuest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapquest-gps-navigation-maps/id316126557).) It’s not just the Interactive globe. One of the most exciting features in last year’s release (iOS 14) was the ability for Maps users to create custom Guides. I created [my own](https://bit.ly/columbiaguide) containing a few local spots I believe to be especially relevant for first-time travelers/new residents of *my* area. Clearly, I misinterpreted the intended function of Guides entirely - continuing without a means of discovering *user-generated* guides, whatsoever, iOS 15 cements (in my view) that they’ll instead continue to be left to travel magazines, none of which I recognize save for *Atlas Obscura*, who’s “[Hidden Wonders of Chicago](https://guides.apple.com/?lsp=9902&pg=15126682529740253227)” guide appears to be the single worthwhile representation of the Midwest on the service.

![Apple Maps User Account in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/TxDuz5nb.png)

One welcome exception to this absence of investment in user-generated content is the new, unified “user account” view, which aggregates one’s curation (both private and public) along with travel preferences and a list of one’s **contributions** to Apple Maps - another new feature for the app. 

![Place Cards - Apple Maps in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/LX5HW4T3.png)

Above is a screenshot of my first test contribution to Apple Maps (my [mom’s private practice](http://bit.ly/elonglcswam),) which also serves as an example of Maps’ new “place cards.” As of this writing, all of my test contributions are still held "Pending Review," yet navigating to [the share link](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1714%20Oak%20Cliff%20Pl,%20Columbia,%20MO%20%2065203,%20United%20States&auid=6487223830929868055&ll=38.933965,-92.387854&lsp=9902&q=Eileen%20Long,%20MSW%20LCSW&_ext=CjIKBQgEEOIBCgQIBRADCgQIBhByCgQIChAACgQIUhAECgQIVRAACgQIWRAGCgUIpAEQARImKZSjW/v4dkNAMW0PujQxGVfAORJ5gVcfeENAQd9/R/9zGFfAUAM%3D&t=m) with a desktop browser indicates they've already been made public.

![3D Hy-Vee](https://i.snap.as/SILn5LmG.png)

### CarPlay

As of this writing, it’s unclear how much of the Maps features I’ve used will be carried over to CarPlay upon iOS 15.0.0’s official release, but I know for *certain* that CarPlay is a weekly (if not daily) used feature by virtually all of my family members. With the additional variable of [differences in support between given automobile marques/models](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/) - including which support [Car Key](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211234) - it’s difficult to say definitively what will have changed about your personal CarPlay use. What experience I do have using CarPlay has been exclusively with my mom’s [2019 Volkswagen Jetta](https://youtu.be/hqQqfdHsGx0,) and documented visually in [this photo gallery](https://snap.as/extratone/ios15) as well as [on my alt Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dieselgoth/channel)’s “iOS & iPhone” IGTV Series.

![Apple Maps Night Navigation](https://i.snap.as/iQD53oId.png)

To once again cite from [the official full features list](https://hyp.is/Cbc_LBUmEey4S4Mcwd1lKA/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/):

> An all-new driving map helps you see traffic, incidents, and other details that affect your drive at a glance. See incredible road details like turn lanes, bike, bus, and taxi lanes, medians, crosswalks, and much more. When approaching a complex interchange, Maps switches to a 3D road-level perspective to help you find your way."

"It's faster and easier to report an issue in Maps" is a standout, literal statement. Once you've navigated to the menu in the screenshot below (via the chatbox with exclamation point icon,) touching any of the three options will *immediately* report its respective information without confirmation.

![Report an Incident - CarPlay in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/VKfuhJvH.png)

The default **Driving Focus** can be configured to activate automatically as soon as CarPlay connects which *would* be the single exception from my earlier advice against automating Focus modes at all were it not for the mode's lockout from the Lock Screen (as shown in the first of the three screenshots embedded below.)

![Driving Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/m5974FcB.png)

Once you've locked your device with the Driving Focus on, you must clear an extra step to unlock it by selecting "I'm Not Driving," which then turns the Focus off. In my (unsolicited) opinion, this renders the Focus unusable at best and arguably downright dangerous. "Hey Siri!" is an option most folks I know leave off and I can't imagine a single reason to add such an obstruction. 

![Custom Car Focus - iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/xcNfKv6g.png)

I *can* offer a solution, however, in the form of my custom Car Focus, which only allows calls and texts from my mom, open a single, otherwise-hidden custom (work-in-progress) Home Screen with exclusively driving/nav/travel-relevant apps, and even activates automatically via a very simple automation in [the Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752). Technically, the only feature it's missing from the default Driving Focus are automatic text replies, which (as of beta) weren't working anyway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hNCsS4I0uk

For those new to Siri Shortcuts completely, I recorded a [rough video guide](https://youtu.be/-hNCsS4I0uk) on how to set up both the Focus and its automation.

![Reminders in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/0tsmBGe3.png)

### Reminders

“A to-do list is, ultimately, nothing more or less than an attempt to persuade yourself” concludes [a feature by Clive Thompson](https://www.wired.com/story/to-do-apps-failed-productivity-tools) in the most recent issue of *WIRED*. In the face of a literally indigestible volume of available (and *award-winning*!) Task Management applications found on iOS - [Microsoft To Do](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-to-do/id1212616790), [Microsoft Lists](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-lists/id1530637363), [Todoist](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855), [Things 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743), [Fantastical](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190), [GoodTask](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-to-do-list-tasks/id1068039220), [OmniFocus 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-3/id1346190318), and on… - Apple’s Reminders app has always had perhaps the most insurmountable task of all its native applications in remaining competitive. Up until I wrote this review, my personal list in the app was nothing but a wasteland of forgotten, out-of-context items from up to 7 years ago (!) which I’d obviously set with Siri without bothering to correct its voice recognition.

Before you proceed to experiment with Reminders, I’d recommend using my [Reminders Backup Siri Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10118) to create a .zip file of *all* existing items in your Reminders app, even if there are just a few. I insist upon this largely because it’s so fast and so frugal. (Here’s [how to allow the addition of Siri Shortcuts from third-party sources](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/enable-shared-shortcuts-apdfeb05586f/ios).)

For a particularly positive - but very trustworthy - perspective on the additions to Reminders coming in iOS 15, [John Voorhees’ overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/reminders-smart-lists-put-unprecedented-control-in-the-hands-of-users/) is succinct and informative.

https://imgur.com/gallery/u8HxROl

An opportunity for an anecdotal, but genuinely exciting! demonstration is allowed us in Reminders: **Drag & Drop** is, indeed, [*finally here*](https://imgur.com/gallery/u8HxROl).

## Safari

```markdown
Before you read on… If you’re just wondering how to make Safari go back to the way it was before, refer back to the first subhead on this page (“The Gist.”)
```

The one commonality in the experience of every single person finishing up their iOS 15 review/overview/guide: we’ve all saved Safari for the very last minute. I am 99% certain the saga surrounding changes to Apple’s native web browser - along with my personal, reactionary gripes spewed along the past two months of iOS 15’s Developer Beta cycle - were the overwhelmingly affirming factors that led to me pursuing this very review. I have rewritten this portion over and over again, but now that you know how to disable the new look, I’m going to as briefly as possible summarize the changes that are actually relevant to you.

* You can now **pull down to refresh**, which apparently the youths *actually* refer to with the acronym “PTR,” these days.
* **Safari Extensions** might be worthwhile. I **absolutely insist** that everyone reading this install one called **Overamped**, which I have been testing. Basically, you’ll never need to think about Google AMP again, which is an absolute gift, I promise.
* **Tab Groups** will almost certainly be nothing but a nuisance for all but the most ridiculous iPhone poweruses like myself.[^3]

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438980179712479241

If, like me, you’ve always found Bookmark/Favorites management in Safari utterly impossible, you’ll rejoice at the implications of Drag & Drop as demonstrated in the [Twitter video](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438980179712479241) embedded above. 

## Baubles

![OMNIMEMOJI](https://i.snap.as/p8U6kW1g.png)

### Memoji

Finally, the great, terrible Apple God has granted its bizarre animated minimes a torso! I have always found memoji [alarming](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/he03xb), mostly, but now that I’ve paid them mind, I would like to express my sympathy for those of you who enjoy using them. I’m sorry to report that you will still need to go to `Messages` and open the compose window in a conversation in order to select the emoji iMessage app. Though iOS 15 adds full bodies to memoji (and clothes to cover them, as required since Adam & Eve,) as well as “accessible accessories,”[^4] there’s not as yet any way to actually *see* a memoji in full-body view other than the editing interface (as far as I could tell.) You can also choose to separately color your memoji’s eyes. 

![Facetime in The Browser Comedy](https://i.snap.as/vBw0CNhW.png)

### Facetime in The Browser

Yes, you can *technically* Facetime with non-Apple devices thanks to iOS 15's changes. In fact, you'll be able to "Facetime" any device with a web browser! *However*, in doing so you will be forgoing every single one of Facetime's advantages: call quality, "privacy," ecosystem integration, etc. Without these, it would be silly to use Facetime over literally *any* other video calling service. What an immense waste of time, eh?

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430679850399014912

For the sake of thoroughness, though, I should note that I appear to be alone in this view of the new Facetime changes. *MacStories* founder and Ultimate iPad Sage Federico Viticci’s [report on the subject](https://www.macstories.net/stories/facetimes-audio-and-video-take-a-leap-forward-with-apples-upcoming-iphone-ipad-and-mac-os-updates/) was one of mostly satisfaction.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/MicModeTest.flac">
</audio>

I will note, too, that [my test](https://whyp.it/t/testing-the-mic-modes-coming-in-facetime-with-ios-15-54749) of the new “Mic Modes” function yielded impressive results (along with a few other experiences I’ve had so far,) especially in the “Voice Isolation” mode’s performance, but - [as I lamented on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430680198442332160) - its association with FaceTime makes it unavailable where one actually could make use of it on iOS.

## Omissions

I know it probably doesn’t mean much to you, but in my lifetime of beta testing iPhone updates, I have never experienced such a disastrous cycle as 15’s. [*MacWorld*’s outline](https://www.macworld.com/article/353957/ios-15-features-missing-at-launch.html) of the expected features *not* coming in today’s release from the 7th of this month has no less than *eight* headings: *SharePlay*, *Legacy Contacts*, *App Privacy Report*, *3D CarPlay navigation*, *Universal Control*, *IDs in Wallet*, *Custom iCloud email domains*, and *CSAM scanning features*. 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438960700286717955

For us powerusers, Siri Shortcuts are absolutely fucked and Apple Dork Twitter is livid about it. Personally, I find these to be the least problematic of the unfixed bugs, and I can only hope it means that Apple has prioritized fixes for the features most relevant in *your* life. I will be updating this Post as actively as I can in the coming weeks and always appreciate any questions or thoughts you might have about how I could make it more useful.

[1] If you’re reading this and happen to be looking for app recommendations, let me know and I’ll ask her. 
[2] This wasn’t working reliably in the last Developer Beta, but I’ll do my best to check back for the normal release.
[3] This is one of those things I can’t say more about until I actually hear from other folks… I’ll check back in a month or so.

I am 99% certain the saga surrounding changes to Apple’s native web browser - along with my personal, reactionary gripes spewed along the past two months of iOS 15’s Developer Beta cycle - were the overwhelmingly affirming factors that led to me pursuing this very review. 

Though I’ve disagreed with *a lot* of what John Gruber has had to say lately, [his constructively critical post about “Safari 15”](https://daringfireball.net/2021/07/safari_15_public_betas_for_mac_and_ios) from early July became an important foothold of affirmation for my sanity as greater tech media went *alarmingly* quickly from shock to justification and then to celebration (one not-unpopular take I saw literally called Apple’s decisions “brave.”) I found this passage especially resonant:

> One can only presume that Apple’s HI team thinks they’re reducing needless “clutter”, but what they’re doing is systematically removing the coherence between what apps look like and the functionality they offer.

"There always has to be something up our sleeve," said Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview I happened to catch in [a bait re-broadcast YouTube stream](https://youtu.be/ki81PEZ3q2U) while writing this. I find it poignant, indeed, recalling my first experience with the new Safari in Dev Beta 1, this past July. I literally thought I'd opened the wrong app. Specifically, the entirely-redesigned interface I saw reminded me a lot of a (living) ghost of [quaint browser concepts past](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/cake-raises-5-million-for-a-swipeable-mobile-browser/)...The general layout of an experimental app called [Cake](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cake-web-browser/id1163553130).

![Cake Browser vs Safari in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/nJ6h60ql.png)

I won't bore you with any parallels, but I do enjoy the (very fantastic) mental image of Apple Devs huddled around good ole' Cake for inspiration. If you're wondering why I haven't actually named a single one of the *changes* I've been referring to, I thought I might present the entirety of [the Safari section in the full iOS 15 features list](https://hyp.is/c_RW3hWqEeyuMqOqKTovnQ/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/features/) sandwiched between a set of screenshots from iOS 14.8’s Safari and a set of the same locations in the browser as it stands in the iOS 15 Release Candidate.

I think the greatest catalyst for the *emotional* component of the controversy lies in the fact that it represents the first complete redesign in the *entire*, 18-year-long history of the software. Since [Safari 1.0 Beta for Mac](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/62233/safari_1_0_beta_mac/) in the Spring of 2003

# “Drafts 28” | Tim Nahumck"

In the past few years, after a summer of running and testing beta software, I often find it difficult to sit down and think about what is new. Don’t get me wrong: it’s not because there isn’t anything, but rather that it’s become second nature to the way I’m working with my systems. This is probably why I don’t do massive reviews of iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, or macOS every year: having to keep all this straight in my brain – given everything else I have going on in my life – just isn’t going to happen. But every fall, I do enjoy writing about the latest version of [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471?uo=4&at=1001l4VZ) and how it’s improving my daily life.

You’re going to notice something here: this isn’t going to be a big, extensive review: there’s no actions, no crazy automations. This isn’t for a lack of updates, but it’s rather a reflection of where my life is at the moment. I actually think that if I’m going to continue to share content – especially with Drafts, Shortcuts, productivity, journaling, etc. – I need to approach everything I do from this point on from a smaller perspective, rather than an all-encompassing viewpoint. I think that many of you would appreciate shorter, easier-to-digest posts that can give targeted use cases/actions/automations going forward. _This is the way_.

Drafts, of course, provides the compatibility you’ve come to expect with the new iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and macOS updates that occur every fall. This year is no different, but one important thing is that some of what Drafts now provides is further extension of already existing functionality. Some of the new features have existed on one part of the platform and not the other due to OS limitations, but now they are synchronized in iOS/iPadOS 15 and macOS Monterey. It brings a sense of cohesiveness across your devices that previously wasn’t there, and I think will open the doors to a lot more possibilities for both iOS/iPadOS and macOS users alike.

For example, one of the biggest parts of this year’s fall update is the all-new watchOS app, completely rewritten in Swift. This isn’t a small undertaking, but it takes the already fantastic watch app and adds additional functionality. It retains everything that it had before, but adds the ability for multiple compilation types. If you really want, you can now have an all-Drafts watch face. Another nice feature, and one I’ve wanted for a while, is the inbox count reflecting the default workspace options; this means I no longer need to see 60+ drafts in my inbox, but rather only a handful that I want to keep in an inbox.

![](https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Watch-Faces.png?resize=1024%2C547&ssl=1)Ok, an all-Drafts watch face might be a _bit_ too much, even for me, but it’s possible.

Another huge update is the incorporation of Shortcuts for the Mac. As I don’t use a Mac, I’m not the expert here, but you can use a lot with it. All of the same features you’ve come to love on iOS are available – even if Shortcuts is buggy – and the Mac adds a few specific items like AppleScript and shell scripts. Hopefully someone out there writes this up nicely: should they do, I will link it here.

While I do use the watch and not the Mac, those aren’t the big things for me this year, despite the massive efforts of the AgileTortoise himself to bring both of them forward. He’s not only been working hard on those, but many others across the other parts of the ecosystem. One of the big features in iOS/iPadOS is the implementation of Live Text. This feature is great, as you can select text from images and scanned documents. Drafts takes advantage of this feature in iOS by providing a menu option to scan a document directly and import the text right on the iPhone. This, like dictation before it, has been a game changer for me when I’ve needed it for work, personal, or legal things over the course of the beta. The fact that I don’t have to manually transfer something into Drafts is huge: from a small bit of text I want to use later to a large document, I can tap (from the widget!) and import the text right into my text editor of choice.

In iPadOS, the support for the latest implementation of the keyboard shortcut menu overlay is there, which mirrors the awesome [Global keyboard shortcuts](https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/06/think-globally-the-ipads-new-universal-keyboard-shortcuts/) introduced this year. You already had something similar in previous releases when you pressed the command ⌘ key, but it was a jumbled mess of what the keyboard shortcuts where. Now, you get a tabulated overlay in easy-to-locate divisions. Given that I have a ton of actions and tried to set up the best keyboard combinations that I could, this is very helpful for me since I might forget them if they are infrequently used. There are 4 categories that are default – file, edit, editor, and view: the remaining sections are all of the actions which have your keyboard shortcuts assigned. Once you invoke the menu, you can either enter the keyboard combination or, my personal favorite, tap the keyboard shortcut in the menu overlay to run it. Saves me some clicks, and I love it. There’s also a search feature where you can search the menu overlay, which is nice for someone like me who has a lot of actions to search.

![](https://i2.wp.com/nahumck.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Drafts-v28-Keyboard-Shortcuts.png?resize=1024%2C187&ssl=1)As you can see, I have a lot of keyboard shortcuts.

The share extension has been updated to include the recently used drafts for easy selection and re-use. While this isn’t the Quick Note feature we’d all love,

it is going to be helpful for when I’m writing/researching a topic I want to investigate and/or write about. Another fantastic usability improvement is the new tag selection interface, which lets you select from your current tags as you type so you don’t duplicate them in weird ways (think: post, posts). In the last few years, I’ve actually pared down my usage of tags because I didn’t want them to proliferate too much; now that this feature is there, I might tag my drafts with more than a singular tag. I like this interface so much that I’m hoping Drafts adds this same functionality for creating `[[wiki-style]]` links, as it’s something I’m using a lot more for my own personal uses. I know that this would be a massive undertaking like folding headers would be, but I can’t help but want both in the future. 

Speaking of wiki-style linking, there are a few new ways to interact with them. You can now right-click/long tap on them to give a quick look of the text as well and commands for wiki links: open the draft in the current or new window, preview in a new window, or a series of copy commands for the content, title, link, or UUID. I really like the new expandable/collapsible menus in iOS/iPadOS 15, which Drafts takes advantage of here; it’s a great way for Drafts and other apps to add a lot of functionality at your fingertips.

Folder bookmarks are a feature that have been included in apps like Scriptable for a long time. But they are now included in the File action and File Manager scripting. This will allow those that like to write in other apps – say Obsidian or iA Writer – to save to a specific location outside of the Drafts sandbox. You can also use the scripting to _read_ as well as write to a location, making it possible to use Drafts with apps like Working Copy on iOS/iPadOS or Taskpaper on the Mac.

I think this will open a door to those that love using Drafts on iOS/iPadOS and then might want other tools on the Mac. It’s not using the file manager to store the files, but it does give the option to use it through actions. I can see where someone might use this to run a single action on files with a specific tag, and have them saved to a specific location in Files; they might also run another action to import those files back into Drafts. It’s not something built in and requires manual syncing but it’s very possible to create now. I hope to see it taken that last step further to open up Drafts to more people who are searching for their [ideal solution](https://sixcolors.com/post/2021/03/searching-for-the-perfect-ios-markdown-writing-tool/). 

There’s a new “What’s New” screen where you can find all of the high-level features as well as a link to the full change log to see the small improvements to things like interface updates, automations, bug fixes, share extensions, and more. You can find this in the Settings (gear) menu in the bottom right of the screen, just under where you can manage your subscription.

You can interact with this new what’s new screen and even jump to the Drafts website to check out specific features or the full change log. And I almost forgot the best part of this update by far: the two new icon choices. I really adore the color palette of both of them and think they are fantastic additions. 

The biggest thing that strikes me with this release is the continued customization and usability enhancements update after update with Drafts. Going all the way back to the initial [Drafts 5 launch](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-5-the-macstories-review/), the customization was further refined from Drafts 4; workspaces created a customizable, modular interface to make that app yours. In [Drafts 15](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-15-review-multiwindow-shortcuts-and-more/), contextual menus and updated icons further extended the customization to pick just the right look for workspaces and actions; Multiwindow support brought more power to the user by navigating back and forth through their drafts. [Drafts 22](https://www.macstories.net/reviews/drafts-22-review-widgets-scribble-and-more/) brought us widgets to customize our home screens and quickly jump into the app or use an action directly. In [Drafts 26](https://nahumck.me/drafts-26-the-customization-update/), the ability to completely [customize the interface](https://tools.getdrafts.com/themes/theme-builder) and create your own [syntaxes](https://actions.getdrafts.com/syntax_definitions) was introduced, spawning completely unique apps from user to user. And now with Drafts 28, we get more integrations in actions to make Drafts yours and be more extensible. This is yet another solid release in a long string of updates since April 2018. I’m looking forward to what’s coming next.

just a thought on *simple as possible*:

## …Safari

I’m sorry, Mom… I really did ask just about everyone I know how on Earth I was going to explain what the fuck happened to Apple’s web browser. I don’t have any explanation and I find little validity in [Apple’s](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc21/10029), but Safari is absolutely fucked, and that’s essentially all that is useful to say. I have personally grown to accept it, but I have been groomed by a penchant for experimental mobile browsers like Cake, and this sentence simply does not stand up for my family members who have depended on Safari to… just work well. For them, I have a (personally unbelievable) alternative, after having tried literally every single browser available on iOS. I wish I could say Edge was the all-around winner, but - bizzarely - it’s [Brave](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/brave-private-web-browser-vpn/id1052879175), hands down. For better or worse, turn off all the stuff that makes Brave actually unique in any way (all iOS browsers are actually built on the exact same platform that doesn’t have anything to do with their desktop counterparts,) and it is my pick for the best balance of speed and competency.

### Facetime in The Browser

Yes, you can *technically* Facetime with non-Apple devices thanks to iOS 15's changes. In fact, you'll be able to "Facetime" any device with a web browser! *However*, in doing so you will be forgoing every single one of Facetime's advantages: call quality, "privacy," ecosystem integration, etc. Without these, it would be silly to use Facetime over literally *any* other video calling service. What an immense waste of time, eh?

A few weeks ago, I came across [a post on Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/shortcuts/comments/d4fzyk/you_can_currently_open_specific_pages_in_the/) claiming that Apple had restored the ability to launch specific sections of the Settings app via Shortcuts in iOS and iPadOS 13.1. I was inspired by that discovery to finish working on a project I had long been putting off: documenting **all the URLs supported by the Settings app** in iOS and iPadOS.

After <del>some</del> a _lot_ of trial and error, I’ve collected 120+ URLs that can open individual pages and sub-sections of the Settings app. In this post, I’m going to share the complete list of URLs that are supported as of iOS and iPadOS 13.1 (specifically, iOS 13.1.2), as well as a custom shortcut to launch them.

The ability to open specific sections of the Settings app isn’t new in iOS 13.1: for [several years now](https://holgr.com/no-jailbreak-necessary-how-to-quickly-access-ios-settings-on-your-ipad-iphone-or-ipod/), Apple has offered a `prefs:root` URL scheme designed to launch the Settings app at a specific path. For instance, `prefs:root=Bluetooth` can open Settings’ Bluetooth page, while `prefs:root=ControlCenter&path=CUSTOMIZE_CONTROLS` can navigate directly into Settings ⇾ Control Center ⇾ Customize Controls. You get the idea.

Historically, Settings URLs have been affected by two main problems: Apple’s tendency to either break them in new versions of iOS or [reject](https://github.com/dpa99c/cordova-diagnostic-plugin/issues/262) apps that [implemented them](https://cromulentlabs.wordpress.com/2017/08/22/on-upcoming-changes-in-ios-11/) citing usage of private APIs, and the inconsistent text format used in the URLs themselves. The `prefs:root` URL scheme goes back several years in iOS’ history, and we’ve seen apps (such as the popular [Launcher](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id905099592?at=10l6nh&ct=ms_inline)) implement support for them by letting users open the Settings app at a specific path. A quick Google search demonstrates how, over the years, [others have tried](https://gist.github.com/deanlyoung/368e274945a6929e0ea77c4eca345560) to put together a list of all (or, at the very least, the most popular) URLs supported by Settings.

Following [two](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-13-the-macstories-review/) big [launches](https://www.macstories.net/news/introducing-macstories-shortcuts-icons-300-custom-home-screen-icons-for-your-shortcuts/) on MacStories last month, I needed to work on something different and fun1, so I decided to spend a few days documenting all the Settings URLs – for main pages and sub-sections – that I could reliably open in iOS and iPadOS 13.1.

I used pre-existing work as the foundation for my research: I went through old lists of `prefs:root` URLs (primarily [these](https://gist.github.com/deanlyoung/368e274945a6929e0ea77c4eca345560) [two](https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/manually-creating-settings-launchers-in-app-launching-apps.2037291/)) and re-tested each URL for iOS and iPadOS 13.1; some of them were still working, others required an update. Then, I turned my attention to finding the URLs for _new_ Settings pages Apple added over the past couple of years and – the most time-consuming task of all – I tested every single sub-page too.

There is no automated method for discovering Settings URLs or scraping the Settings app: I had to _guess_ each one by starting with the title of each page (in English), trying different encoding and capitalization formats, and attempting to launch it via Shortcuts. It took a while, but it was exactly the kind of boring, repetitive task I needed to take my mind off the iOS 13 review.

Below, you’ll find a list of the 120+ Settings URLs I was able to test in iOS and iPadOS 13.1, grouped by section and listed in the same order they appear in the Settings app.

Some notes on these URLs:

  * They can be launched using the ‘Open URLs’ action of the Shortcuts app as of iOS and iPadOS 13.1.2. Apple may kill this functionality again in the future; hopefully, they won’t.
  * You may be able to launch these URLs without the Shortcuts app, but I haven’t tested it.
  * The URLs are written in English, but they should work for every language you can assign your iOS or iPadOS device. I’ve tested them both in Spanish and Italian and they continued to work.
  * I may have missed a few URLs supported by Settings. If you know of any other URLs that are working in iOS or iPadOS 13.1, feel free to get in touch (either via email or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/viticci)) and I’ll add them to the list below.

In addition to the complete list available below, I’ve also put together a shortcut to launch any of these Settings URLs by picking from a list in the Shortcuts app. The shortcut, called ‘Open Settings’, contains the full list of 120+ Settings URLs and can be used both in the Shortcuts app and widget.

Open a specific page or sub-section of the Settings app. This shortcut contains over 120 Settings URLs, and you can choose which one to open from a list. You can also create standalone shortcuts for each URL.  
The shortcut works in the app, widget, and Siri.

[Get the shortcut here.](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/58ae614ca5ba4958900fcbeb8c1854aa)

I’ve created a shortcut with every URL for reference purposes but, honestly, the best way to launch these URLs is with dedicated shortcuts. Grab the Settings URL you want, create a new shortcut with two actions (‘URL’ and ‘Open URLs’), paste the URL, and you’ll have a custom one-tap launcher to open _any_ section of Settings from anywhere.

![This is all you need to do to open a Settings URL with Shortcuts.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2019-10-01-02-58-50.jpeg)

This is all you need to do to open a Settings URL with Shortcuts.

My favorite way to launch specific pages of Settings is via our own **[MacStories Shortcuts Icons](https://www.macstories.net/pixel/shortcuts/)**, which I’ve assigned to different shortcuts on my Home screen. In the screenshot below, you can see a few examples of my Settings launchers for Control Center, Camera settings, and Software Update based on MacStories Shortcuts Icons (including one that will be part of the next free update to the pack).

My Home screen is still in flux (mostly because [Silvia](https://twitter.com/_silviagatta) made too many icons to choose from, which is a good problem to have), but I like where this is going:

![Settings shortcuts on the Home screen \(right\). The "info" icon will be part of the next free update to MacStories Shortcuts Icons.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2019-10-01-16-43-51.png)

Settings shortcuts on the Home screen (right). The “info” icon will be part of the next free update to MacStories Shortcuts Icons.

_You can buy MacStories Shortcuts Icons using the button above, or read more details [here](https://www.macstories.net/pixel/shortcuts/)._

It is my goal to keep this list of Settings URLs up to date over time, and I hope that Apple won’t remove the ability to launch `prefs:root` URLs via the Shortcuts app in future iOS or iPadOS updates.

You can find the full list below.

# iOS 15 Reviewed for My Family 2021-09-14-04.29.08 Backup

![iOS 15 is Not His Year](https://i.snap.as/X3rV4nPq.png)

## It's been a tough summer for the *Always Feature-Focused* Tribe.

Eighty days ago, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering ~~stood up in front of a crowd of~~... 

No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother’s basement, on a Monday morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of the Apple community’s unbelievably unreserved, almost *spiritual* volume of **pure hype** from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage. (Hilariously, *all* of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in 2015 and [kept comparing to Slack](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison), but like an actual madman.)

Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:

> For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...

I’m dwelling on them because they are **patently meaningless**. Very little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call *ease-of-use-centric*. Some of it - namely controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari - feels almost maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of [**the full feature list**](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/) are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

![The Foundation Image](https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png)

This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone’s billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig *should* be referring to with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or “end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a *utilitarian* device, above all else. They don’t have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn them off. Realistically, they don’t even have time to read this whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.) 

Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users’ devices over the Find My network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple Maps’ live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.

![Testing Home Screens for iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/eBBnwCIn.png)

What I *will* dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple’s automation knows better than us users when something should happen or change. A great example: using [a simple Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c) to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead of trusting the [unnecessarily complex conditions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086) of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons. 

Quite simply, the more automated iOS has become, the less comfortably in control I have felt. For myself, at least, every single functional automation Apple has introduced has drastically failed to simply my own using life, and the vast majority have in fact complicated it dramatically. Apple-adjacent publications and greater tech media have ceased all-out criticism and instead resorted to justifying and explaining (or attempting to, anyway) just about all of Apple’s subtle retractions of user control over the years, but apparently, I am too much of a control freak to let it go. I have been here since the very beginning, have bitched loudly all along, and do not plan to go quietly into that automated night. This theme pervades throughout this review, so for any of you who *do* feel like iOS’ automations fit comfortably into your life, please keep this in mind. 

![Safari Settings in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/oHqejXq1.png)

## The Gist

Rounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode immediately after installing iOS 15, you’ll notice that Notifications and other elements have had their rounded corners *further* rounded, for some reason. Assuming Safari ships with its new look turned on by default, the screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to change) where one can switch it off. (Your best bet is to visit its settings menu as displayed on the right in `Settings ⇨ Safari`.) As of this writing, at least two of iOS 15’s “headlining” features have been pushed to further iterative updates: [SharePlay](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/ios-15-apple-shareplay-tv-delay-b1904548.html) and [iCloud Private Relay](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/). I suspect you will be prompted to explore Focus Modes upon initial installation, which I will eventually analyze in relative detail. Ideally, you’ll also be prompted to explore “Shared With You,” which I personally believe to be the release’s most significant addition for most people, by far. 

As far as "meaningful ways iPhone could help you," I see little more than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not so complex to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this moment) a pretty hopeless implementation of a theoretically useful concept. Some additional filters in Apple Maps search will prove useful so long as the associated metadata has been updated for locations *other* than San Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.) Optical Character (text) Recognition has been implemented “system wide” under the feature Apple terms “Live Text,” and translation has finally been extended to the places where it’s most useful (think: Safari.) 

In general, though, most of what’s coming with iOS 15 has little real value in the day-to-day experience for most iPhone users. A complete inversion of Craig’s phrase feels significantly more accurate: *This year, we were inspired to create even more superficial ways iPhone could temporarily dazzle tech media*. 

And now, I’d like to take you through what I feel are the considerations I’d like my family to know - namely my 70-year-old mother, who depends 100% on her iPhone and MacBook Pro every day to run her private practice - but also my ~8 nieces and nephews spanning 6th grade-graduate school, who all - if I’m not mistaken - have iPhones.

```markdown
Worthy of note: this “review” is very heavily focused on *iOS* - which is to say *iPhone* - to the point where any overlap with iPadOS/MacOS/WatchOS/HomeOS/any other goddamned operating system are purely coincidental. For coverage of those changes, please seek your regular sources.
```

![Shared With You - Photos App in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/5otqrdNU.png)

## Photos

### Shared With You

The single most important/welcome feature addition to iOS 15 for most people, I believe, is found in Apple’s native Photos app and entitled **Shared With You**. This view - found in the second tab in the bottom navigation row (“For You”) - is a reverse-chronological timeline of every bit of media (photos & videos) you’ve ever been sent over iMessage. For those with a lot of iOS-using friends (unlike myself,) I would imagine the list will take quite a while to populate. 

### Memories

I find Alex Guyot’s bit on changes to Memories (from [his iOS 15 overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/)) much more concise than what I’d written, so here it is almost in full:

> Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple Music, and can be customized with color filters. Setting different filters will result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on Memories videos.  

> While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn’t transition away. The song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically altered to match back up with the song’s beat.  

> If you don’t want to go with the song that was chosen automatically, you can tap the new Music button to get a pop-up interface into Apple Music, allowing you to choose a song manually. This interface will include smart suggestions for other songs that Apple thinksd you’ll like which would also fit the vibe of your video.  

https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg

Yeah. I hope you’re at least half as amused as I have continued to be by algorithmic video generation. [The above result](https://youtu.be/7uFR_bSxhTg) was created with absolutely zero modification from an album of images and videos which Photos automatically created via face recognition. The only other coherent option from my own limited set of photos is really the only one that matters, I think you'll agree. "Pet Friends" yielded [inevitably uplifting results](https://youtu.be/-1bA7-oslkc) in all three of my test renders, but - given a crop of cute dog photos - little intelligence is necessary to produce.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1bA7-oslkc

If you're experiencing any sort of Déjà vu from the idea of auto-generated slideshows with rights-free soundtracks in the Photos app, it's because Apple has made several distinct attempts to implement very similar iterations of the feature throughout iPhone's history, which has involved iMovie on iOS and MacOS once or twice. I have fiddled with every one - including iOS 15's - and my (truly sound and original) advice is to **avoid spending time trying to customize auto-generated videos** in general. If you explore one of the suggested Memories and find the software's default result satisfactory, of course you should save it, but be wary of any attempts to take editorial control yourself.

![Visual Lookup Indicator in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/74HOlnLP.png)

### Visual Lookup

Perhaps the most unjustifiable background use of your phone’s resources introduced in iOS 15, “Visual Lookup,” seeks to identify “popular art and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers out in nature, books, and breeds of pets” present in your photos so that you might… identify them more swiftly(?) The only means of distinguishing photos on which Visual Lookup has been applied is to look for the modified ⓘ symbol at the very bottom of your screen in the photo browsing view (see the screenshot embedded above.) As you might notice in the screenshots *below*, not one of its analyses on my own images was usably accurate. 

The decision to target the feature on identifying domesticated pets, specifically, is more universalizing than historic landmarks, for sure, but it also immediately sets up the technology (at least this preview of it) for failure.  

![Visual Lookup in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/AtxzN45h.png)

### Metadata

Hooray! You can now view an image's basic details in the "Info pane," by swiping up on an image or using the ⓘ button. This includes the extension (type) and size of the image file, camera identification and configuration details, and -  as part of Shared With You - from whom/where you got the image. Bizarrely, the "Adjust" tool also lets you alter a given image's timestamp and location information. While I can imagine infinitely many reasons why you'd want to *omit* or *delete* such information, I cannot conceive of a single wholesome reason why one would chose to *change* it, instead. 

![Photo Stacks in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/93BGmX4I.png)

### Messages

Just a few weeks shy of [iMessage's tenth birthday](https://web.archive.org/web/20120308031950/https://www.apple.com/ios/features.html), Apple has finally added a button to save incoming photos directly in Messages conversations. It's about as blatant as Apple interface design gets - you'll spot it opposite others' images. Tapping it saves the appropriate photo(s) directly to the Recents folder before a silly animation vanishes the button itself.

Once again, from Mr. Guyot:

> Groups of photos that you send will now be shown as stacks instead of in a long list, allowing you to more easily swipe through the images without losing track of the conversation around them. Tap on a stack to open a grid view where you can see and select multiple photos at once.  

I took the screenshot embedded above in iOS 15 Developer Beta 5, and… Do “stacks” not look hilariously janky as fuck?

### Background Sounds

My eldest sister has used a sound/noise machine to sleep for as long as I can remember, so I was especially excited to show her iOS 15’s native “Background Sounds” feature, but she was distinctly unimpressed, noting that her iPhone-based sound generation needs were well met by third-party apps she’d already discovered.[^1] I didn’t have time to try out her recommendations, but I’m going to assume they aren’t able to operate “behind” *additional* audio playback like the “new” native feature is.

![Background Sounds Interrupt Remedy](https://i.snap.as/SGQt93K4.png)

My personal (hopefully insightful) anecdote: Background Sounds appear to be impervious from the audio interruption issues iOS has struggled with since its origin, which makes them a partial remedy to the discomfort of sudden, unexpected silence when using headphones with active noise cancellation. As configured in the screenshot embedded above (the menu found in `Settings ⇨ Accessibility ⇨ Audio/Visual ⇨ Background Sounds`) - with “Use When Media Is Playing” toggled `OFF`- your selected Background Sound *should* fade in when normal playback from another app is interrupted.[^2] 

### “Spatial Audio”

Just to be clear, I strongly believe that normal users should basically ignore all mention of Apple’s “Spatial Audio” (read: don’t worry about it) for a few reasons, most of which aren’t all that interesting. Since [one of my very first written works on tech](https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback) was/is directly related to the subject, though, indulge me for just a moment for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note that only two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms you’ve certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are) are necessary for audio to become “spatial.” If you’re curious about this, [my favorite all-time web experience from *The Pudding*](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/) is an absolutely impeccable next destination. Secondly, the actual technology behind Apple’s title was not developed by Apple, but by Dolby. It’s not that Apple doesn’t acknowledge this thoroughly in [their explainer docs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182), nor is Dolby by any means a wee organization in need of my amplification, but this is one of those Apple habits that’s become a particular peev. If you’re interested, [here is the actual spec sheet for Dolby Atmos in PDF](https://professional.dolby.com/siteassets/cinema-products---documents/dolby-atmos-specifications.pdf).

![Control Center Decibel Meter](https://i.snap.as/1vGTW0Iz.png)

If you happen to have either AirPods Pro or AirPods Max devices, an iPhone 7 or later, *and* an Apple Music subscription, you might want to disregard my cynicism at least long enough to try "[dynamic head tracking](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182)."

### SharePlay

*The Verge*’s Chaim Gartenburg did [an excellent - if a bit precocious - job of explaining](https://www.theverge.com/22577178/shareplay-how-to-apple-facetime-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-apple-tv-video-music) what he describes as iOS 15’s “headline feature,” called SharePlay:

> It’s a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends and family while video chatting.  

In my opinion, SharePlay represents one of those great, well-thought solutions to some notably youth-specific challenges which nobody (even the youth) will see as more worthwhile than their own. By that I mean, one ear bud per person… now, an ancient tradition. I’ve deprioritized it, in contrast to Chaim, because I’d bet it’s also one of those things one can only learn themselves.

![Notifications in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/TFWvW1b6.png)

## Notifications, Focus, and Attention

Yes, notifications have gotten *even rounder still* for some reason in iOS 15. Contact photos and “larger app icons” also “make them easier to identify,” according to Apple. (This is the one point in my whole writing life where the phrase *well I’ll be the judge of that!* is 100% valid and applicable.) There’s also a new feature called **Notification Summary** which is an absolutely useless and unnecessary complication, at least at the moment. Honestly, the one bit of solid advice from [*The Social Dilemma*](https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma) was… Just turn all Notifications off, or at least as many as possible. Notifications Summary feels like a near direct response to that one goddamned film, and its new Focus Modes do even more so.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=YZCx-9wF3ow

### Focus(es)

The most glaringly standout parallel between Microsoft’s Windows upcoming Windows 11 release (which I have also been beta testing much less dutifully for most of this year) and Apple’s stated goals in iOS 15’s design centers around the design supposition that maximum malleability of the “spaces” in which one dwells on their operating system - namely, the “desktop(s)” and/or “home screen(s)” - lends toward a more healthy digital occupancy of them, especially in terms of attention. Unfortunately, both of them chose respective solutions which - from my view, anyway - **add complexity** more than anything.

[*The Verge*’s guide](https://www.theverge.com/22665196/ios-15-focus-modes-custom-icons-widgets-how-to) frames Focus as a customization feature to be used in tandem with [custom app icons](https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change) to fiddle your way into your own *bespoke iPhone experience*. I could be wrong, but I suspect very few among my family will find the time investment required worth the end result, but we’ll see.

![Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/mxwVtN7p.png)

I chose to embed [Matt Birchler’s guide to Focus](https://youtu.be/YZCx-9wF3ow) above because it’s by far the most succinct and helpful video I’ve yet seen on iOS 15, generally, and demonstrates how a working person might actually use Focus. My one addendum to this (and any other Focus) guide: **proceed *without* the automated bits** by avoiding anything under the `TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY` subsection of the menu. For whatever reason, location-based automation triggers on iPhone, especially, have literally **never** functioned usefully (or *reliably*) in my experience. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40y7iLdfOnM

## Maps & CarPlay

(I *am* going to do a bit of editorializing on this subject, specifically.) If the video embedded above is confusing, know that it's a very insular joke - over six years ago, in [my video review of the Nissan Juke NISMO](https://bit.ly/JukeHonk), I praised its integrated navigation screen specifically for its frugality. 

> I'm not old. I don't need a gigantic nav screen. I don't need to see a 3D rendition of the whole Earth and my position relative to it.

...and yet, a playful, exploratory experience is what Apple has in mind for Maps, apparently. Here's their description of the new "Interactive globe" feature:

> Discover the natural beauty of Earth with a rich and interactive 3D globe, including significantly enhanced details for mountain ranges, deserts, forests, oceans, and more.

In the footnotes, it’s explained that the feature will only be available on "iPhone with A12 Bionic or later," meaning the iPhone X range, basically, which makes sense considering the extent of animation and touch manipulation technology present in this view. It’s an entertaining plaything, but not much more, which is strange and frustrating. If I could gather the usage statistics across all my family’s iPhones, how much time would you suppose they’ve spent in Apple Maps to date *screwing around* as opposed to *searching and navigating*? 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1437519482428272641

Put another way - Apple’s developmental direction for Apple Maps as a service seems distinctly toward a travel/entertainment application (notably, like [Google Earth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097),) instead of a utilitarian navigation app (like [Google Maps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354), [Waze](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106), or [MapQuest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapquest-gps-navigation-maps/id316126557).) It’s not just the Interactive globe. One of the most exciting features in last year’s release (iOS 14) was the ability for Maps users to create custom Guides. I created [my own](https://bit.ly/columbiaguide) containing a few local spots I believe to be especially relevant for first-time travelers/new residents of *my* area. Clearly, I misinterpreted the intended function of Guides entirely - continuing without a means of discovering *user-generated* guides, whatsoever, iOS 15 cements (in my view) that they’ll instead continue to be left to travel magazines, none of which I recognize save for *Atlas Obscura*, who’s “[Hidden Wonders of Chicago](https://guides.apple.com/?lsp=9902&pg=15126682529740253227)” guide appears to be the single worthwhile representation of the Midwest on the service.

![Apple Maps User Account in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/TxDuz5nb.png)

One welcome exception to this absence of investment in user-generated content is the new, unified “user account” view, which aggregates one’s curation (both private and public) along with travel preferences and a list of one’s **contributions** to Apple Maps - another new feature for the app. 

![Place Cards - Apple Maps in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/LX5HW4T3.png)

Above is a screenshot of my first test contribution to Apple Maps (my [mom’s private practice](http://bit.ly/elonglcswam),) which also serves as an example of Maps’ new “place cards.” As of this writing, all of my test contributions are still held "Pending Review," yet navigating to [the share link](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1714%20Oak%20Cliff%20Pl,%20Columbia,%20MO%20%2065203,%20United%20States&auid=6487223830929868055&ll=38.933965,-92.387854&lsp=9902&q=Eileen%20Long,%20MSW%20LCSW&_ext=CjIKBQgEEOIBCgQIBRADCgQIBhByCgQIChAACgQIUhAECgQIVRAACgQIWRAGCgUIpAEQARImKZSjW/v4dkNAMW0PujQxGVfAORJ5gVcfeENAQd9/R/9zGFfAUAM%3D&t=m) with a desktop browser indicates they've already been made public.

![3D Hy-Vee](https://i.snap.as/SILn5LmG.png)

### CarPlay

As of this writing, it’s unclear how much of the Maps features I’ve used will be carried over to CarPlay upon iOS 15.0.0’s official release, but I know for *certain* that CarPlay is a weekly (if not daily) used feature by virtually all of my family members. With the additional variable of [differences in support between given automobile marques/models](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/) - including which support [Car Key](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211234) - it’s difficult to say definitively what will have changed about your personal CarPlay use. What experience I do have using CarPlay has been exclusively with my mom’s [2019 Volkswagen Jetta](https://youtu.be/hqQqfdHsGx0,) and documented visually in [this photo gallery](https://snap.as/extratone/ios15) as well as [on my alt Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dieselgoth/channel)’s “iOS & iPhone” IGTV Series.

![Apple Maps Night Navigation](https://i.snap.as/iQD53oId.png)

To once again cite from [the official full features list](https://hyp.is/Cbc_LBUmEey4S4Mcwd1lKA/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/):

> An all-new driving map helps you see traffic, incidents, and other details that affect your drive at a glance. See incredible road details like turn lanes, bike, bus, and taxi lanes, medians, crosswalks, and much more. When approaching a complex interchange, Maps switches to a 3D road-level perspective to help you find your way."

"It's faster and easier to report an issue in Maps" is a standout, literal statement. Once you've navigated to the menu in the screenshot below (via the chatbox with exclamation point icon,) touching any of the three options will *immediately* report its respective information without confirmation.

![Report an Incident - CarPlay in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/VKfuhJvH.png)

The default **Driving Focus** can be configured to activate automatically as soon as CarPlay connects which *would* be the single exception from my earlier advice against automating Focus modes at all were it not for the mode's lockout from the Lock Screen (as shown in the first of the three screenshots embedded below.)

![Driving Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/m5974FcB.png)

Once you've locked your device with the Driving Focus on, you must clear an extra step to unlock it by selecting "I'm Not Driving," which then turns the Focus off. In my (unsolicited) opinion, this renders the Focus unusable at best and arguably downright dangerous. "Hey Siri!" is an option most folks I know leave off and I can't imagine a single reason to add such an obstruction. 

![Custom Car Focus - iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/xcNfKv6g.png)

I *can* offer a solution, however, in the form of my custom Car Focus, which only allows calls and texts from my mom, open a single, otherwise-hidden custom (work-in-progress) Home Screen with exclusively driving/nav/travel-relevant apps, and even activates automatically via a very simple automation in [the Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752). Technically, the only feature it's missing from the default Driving Focus are automatic text replies, which (as of beta) weren't working anyway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hNCsS4I0uk

For those new to Siri Shortcuts completely, I recorded a [rough video guide](https://youtu.be/-hNCsS4I0uk) on how to set up both the Focus and its automation.

![Reminders in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/0tsmBGe3.png)

### Reminders

“A to-do list is, ultimately, nothing more or less than an attempt to persuade yourself” concludes [a feature by Clive Thompson](https://www.wired.com/story/to-do-apps-failed-productivity-tools) in the most recent issue of *WIRED*. In the face of a literally indigestible volume of available (and *award-winning*!) Task Management applications found on iOS - [Microsoft To Do](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-to-do/id1212616790), [Microsoft Lists](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-lists/id1530637363), [Todoist](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855), [Things 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743), [Fantastical](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190), [GoodTask](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-to-do-list-tasks/id1068039220), [OmniFocus 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-3/id1346190318), and on… - Apple’s Reminders app has always had perhaps the most insurmountable task of all its native applications in remaining competitive. Up until I wrote this review, my personal list in the app was nothing but a wasteland of forgotten, out-of-context items from up to 7 years ago (!) which I’d obviously set with Siri without bothering to correct its voice recognition.

Before you proceed to experiment with Reminders, I’d recommend using my [Reminders Backup Siri Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10118) to create a .zip file of *all* existing items in your Reminders app, even if there are just a few. I insist upon this largely because it’s so fast and so frugal. (Here’s [how to allow the addition of Siri Shortcuts from third-party sources](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/enable-shared-shortcuts-apdfeb05586f/ios).)

For a particularly positive - but very trustworthy - perspective on the additions to Reminders coming in iOS 15, [John Voorhees’ overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/reminders-smart-lists-put-unprecedented-control-in-the-hands-of-users/) is succinct and informative.

An opportunity for an anecdotal, but genuinely exciting! demonstration is allowed us in Reminders: **Drag & Drop** is, indeed, [*finally here*](https://imgur.com/gallery/u8HxROl).

# [The Unlicense, Dave Edition](https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1)

Considering my use of Git as a means to track revisions on my own writing, it's important to note that you should feel free to replace all instances of "software" in the statement below with "words," "writing," "expression," “editorial ideation,” etc.

While I appreciate tremendously the work and contribution of [Arlo Bendiken](https://ar.to/2010/01/set-your-code-free) in the form of The Unlicense, I would like to add that I see no need, personally, to make the refutation of Intellectual Property law regarding my own work into some profound ethical statement. As it stands, I have not to my knowledge been the victim of any sort of theft of any kind, and find the suggestion highly unlikely. If I *am*  made aware of such a case, there is certainly a possibility that I may change my mind on this issue, so I suppose I should highlight that **THESE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE**, though I suspect I would be more flattered and/or amused than actually offended. 

I would also like to annotate that my use of this license should not be regarded as a suggestion that anyone else follow my example, or that I "believe in" taking such action regarding one's work, generally. While I did indeed take the time to set up [a repository](https://github.com/extratone/eoi) of John Perry Barlow's "[The Economy of Ideas](https://www.wired.com/1994/03/economy-ideas/)" in a bunch of different document formats, I do not necessarily agree with all of what he argued, especially in the context of the world 27 years later. If you *are* particularly interested in my opinion on the matter for whatever reason, here is what I have to say to you:

The principled beginning of The Open Web was a great moment in history, but - like all historical principles - it is extremely important that we consider *context* and maintain an appropriate level of criticism when looking back on old manifestos written by old white guys. In general, try your best to *be reasonable*.

# Make Audio from Document Text

## Creates an audio file of text identified in a document read aloud by Siri (Text to Speech.)

![Siri TTS](https://i.snap.as/13BtYmx0.png)

## About

**Note: this shortcut requires iOS 15 Developer or Public Beta 6**

This shortcut utilizes 4 new Actions coming with iOS 15. The first - “**Extract Text From Image**” - is used to transcribe the text present in a given file/document via OCR. 

According to the Action’s description, it is capable of reading text from the following input types:

> Evernote notes, App Store apps, Bar codes, Images, Podcasts, Rich text, iTunes products, Giphy items, Podcast episodes, PDFs, iTunes media, Media, Contacts, Photo media, Shazam media, Locations, iTunes artists

This shortcut is primarily configured for PDF input, but obviously, your particular needs should be customized for.

Because the output of `Extract Text From Image` is a list of single lines, this shortcut uses `Combine Text` to convert them to single spaces, the result of which is particularly suited for Siri to read.

The plain text result is then passed to “Make Audio From Text”  (the second) action arriving in iOS 15 (which has finally been fixed as of Developer Beta 6) to generate an .m4a audio file of Siri Voice 2 (by default) reading the document’s text aloud (rather than just speaking it aloud on your handset/iPad, as the original does.)

The 3rd and 4th new actions are used to capture and crop a 1000 x 1000 thumbnail image of the inputted document for use as the output file’s cover art.

After the raw audio has been synthesized, it is passed to an `Encode Media` action, which converts it to an .m4a file with metadata (that I highly encourage you customize.)

By default, the shortcut is configured to save the .m4a file to iCloud Drive in /audio/TTS/ as [the original file’s name].m4a.

A full explanation/detailed guide can be found [**on my blog**](https://bilge.world/siri-tts), and the full text of the latter portion (in first draft form) has been posted beneath the contact details in [the description of a sister shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953).

# [Take 2] iOS 15 Reviewed for My Family

![iOS 15 is Not His Year](https://i.snap.as/X3rV4nPq.png)

## It's been a tough summer for the *Always Feature-Focused* Tribe.

Eighty days ago, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering ~~stood up in front of a crowd of~~... 

No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother’s basement, on a Monday morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of the Apple community’s unbelievably unreserved, almost *spiritual* volume of **pure hype** from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage. (Hilariously, *all* of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in 2015 and kept comparing to Slack, but like an actual madman.)

Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:

> For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...

I’m dwelling on them because they are **patently meaningless**. Very little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call *ease-of-use-centric*. Some of it - namely controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari - feels almost maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of the full feature list are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

![The Foundation Image](https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png)

This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone’s billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig *should* be referring to with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or “end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a *utilitarian* device, above all else. They don’t have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn them off. Realistically, they don’t even have time to read this whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.) 

Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users’ devices over the Find My network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple Maps’ live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I. 

What I *will* dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple’s automation knows better than us users when something should happen or change. A great example: using [a simple Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c) to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead of trusting the [unnecessarily complex conditions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086) of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons. 

Quite simply, the more automated iOS has become, the less comfortably in control I have felt. For myself, at least, every single functional automation Apple has introduced has drastically failed to simply my own using life, and the vast majority have in fact complicated it dramatically. Apple-adjacent publications and greater tech media have ceased all-out criticism and instead resorted to justifying and explaining (or attempting to, anyway) just about all of Apple’s subtle retractions of user control over the years, but apparently, I am too much of a control freak to let it go. I have been here since the very beginning, have bitched loudly all along, and do not plan to go quietly into that automated night. This theme pervades throughout this review, so for any of you who *do* feel like iOS’ automations fit comfortably into your life, please keep this in mind. 

<img src="https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png" alt="The Foundation Image" style="zoom:33%;" />

Two converging elements define my changing relationship with iOS, and they really feel like one tornado coming from everywhere and nowhere…

The net number of unconscious actions happening “in the background” on my phone has been exploding exponentially for its whole history. It has become a silent supercomputer all for the sake of knowing better than I what I might need from it at any given time. 

The universal result, for me at least, has been a rapidly declining sense of control over my device. I know the YouTube algorithm is technically supposed to be better at serving up content from channels I subscribe to at the optimal moment I should be watching it, but the only effective tool I’ve used for doing so was a combined, one-axis, strictly chronological feed. This format is one I understood even very young through-and-through as a being existing on a single-direction metaphysical time plane. I was a very astute consumer of at least a dozen and a half creator’s output for a very long time, and I managed to do so without so much as the means to “mark as play.ed.” 

From my perspective, there is virtually zero value or use in selecting a “subscribe” toggle without said feed. I know it to be entirely futile to keep up the way I did, then, without it. 

Its replacement will never be trustworthy enough to turn notifications on ever again. I’m sorry, I have never had to count on suggestions… Until you took away the tools I had to actually discover and associate. The problem is that its

…the reason I’m bringing this up is that I’ve found iOS to be slightly more bearable by actively seeking alternatives in my direct control to whatever Apple is trying very hard to get to guess when I wanted to so that I don’t have to push the button???

That’s the lesson: whenever you can, **find that fucking button**. My general role seems to be finding and reclaiming as many of those metaphorical buttons as possible, which is, yes, an inherently ridiculous and frustrating undertaking. 

* Clocks are the only other reliable triggers. (And they’re so much more fucking efficient!.)

The automated focus is the perfect example of this shit’s inherently impossible/,mostly unwanted, and *ridiculously* resource-gluttonous situation.

## About

**Note: this shortcut requires iOS 15 Developer or Public Beta 6**

Building on Apple’s own “Speak Body of Article” shortcut found in the default Siri Shortcuts Gallery, this Shortcut takes advantage of the upcoming “Make Audio From Text” action arriving in iOS 15 (which has finally been fixed as of Developer Beta 6) to generate an .m4a audio file of Siri Voice 2 (by default) reading the article’s body aloud (rather than just speaking it aloud on your handset/iPad, as the original does,) with appropriate metadata from the inputted webpage. 

As configured by default, it should function from the Share Sheet in Safari *and/or* by grabbing a web URL from the clipboard.

A full explanation/detailed guide can be found [**on my blog**](https://bilge.world/siri-tts), and the full text of the latter portion (in first draft form) has been posted beneath the contact details immediately below.

![TTS Shortcuts Compared](https://i.snap.as/P0yJJyUc.png)

# Guide

So! For those of you currently running the latest iOS 15 Beta and those in the future running the full release, **what follows is a guide on how you can use my own shortcuts and methods to generate, metadate, and embed Siri-powered audio text-to-speech files relatively quickly without having to use desktop-class (or any other) hardware**.

To begin, you should install two brand new shortcuts of mine: [**Make Audio from Article Body**](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9953/) and (if you intend to stick with me to the embed stage, anyway,) my [< audio > Embed Tool](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/). Both should function out of the box, but I would highly encourage that you try building your own shortcut around the `Make Audio From Text` action, even if you've never worked with Shortcuts (or any sort of automation, for that matter) before, *especially* if you plan to be using Siri as a text-to-speech generator with any frequency. 

### Intended Result

Throughout this guide, I'm going to be using [a five-year-old ramble of mine](https://bilge.world/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery) about the oddly-perceptive bits found in early-oughts Disney movies as example text. Earlier today, I used my own personalized version of my new shortcut to generate an example of in which the process we're about to explore should result. The ~6000 words of text took just over 3 minutes, 30 seconds to render consistently in three consecutive timed attempts. You can listen to it [on Whyp](https://whyp.it/t/johnny-tsunami-vi-separate-but-equal-siri-voice-2-tts-74752) and/or inspect [the actual file](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a) yourself, if you'd like.

![Plain Text Parsed by Safari](https://i.snap.as/dktmGQQb.png)

### Input Format

If we were trying to do this using any other available method in 2021 - even the expensive ones - our first task would be scrubbing our subject text of any special formatting (Word,) symbols, embed, hyperlinks, and any other data Siri doesn't understand (roman numerals, for example.) As a Windows user who's not at all new to free ways to automate accessibility improvements to web content, I envy both you and my new self for the magic available to us in the form of Safari's abilities to parse complex web content. In my experience, there's nothing like it (at least nothing available to regular consumers.) 

The screenshot embedded above shows the result of a `Quick Look` action inserted just after the `Text` action produced by the public version of my shortcut when run on our example. There are three immediately problematic issues:

1. Siri doesn't understand roman numerals, so she will read "Johnny Tsunami VI" as *Johnny Tsunami vee eye*.
2. "The Psalms" is not my name, though it is what this blog currently returns when asked for a byline. In my experience, this generally isn't an issue with most mainstream media CMSs.
3. The shortcut appears to have failed to retrieve any data for the `Published Date` variable from my blog. (Also a relatively specific consideration.)

If you'll note in the *previous* embedded image comparing my custom version of the shortcut (left) to the published version (right,) you'll note that my chosen solution is to manually input all metadata before actually starting the shortcut. What's not shown is my corresponding manual inputs in the `Encode Trimmed Media` action, which includes attaching a retrieved image file (in the Working Copy action you *can* see) as album art. For my intended use - exclusively generating text-to-speech audio of Posts on this blog - this makes more sense than unnecessarily automating metadata retrieval.

The extraordinary thing about the screenshot, though, is that it doesn't contain any of the other crap (as described above) found in the original page. (Beforehand, it looked more [like this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/extratone/bilge/main/posts/johnny-tsunami-smart-house-slavery.md).) It's especially reliable at parsing WordPress-bound content, which still makes up [s̵͕̈́͊c̶̥̏̚r̶̥͈̃è̴̙͌å̴̹m̵̛̅ͅi̶̦̾͘n̸͎̟̎̃g̶͎͛] percent of the whole web. **Treasure this power**, folks.

![Simpler TTS Examples](https://i.snap.as/OMwKdOUI.png)

If all you need read aloud is the body text, things become even simpler. In the right example above, I've simply deleted the `Text` action and replaced it with `Get text from [the Safari Web Article's body]`. Theoretically, one could omit that action, even, and simply use the direct output of `Get Body from Article` as input for the `Make spoken audio from text` action, but I say keep the extra step unless it becomes an issue.

**If you're actually *beginning* with clean plain text** and don't care about metadata in your final audio file and/or if you're planning on passing the result through other audio/metadata editing software, anyway, the left, three-action shortcut is all you need. It will result in a [Core Audio Format (.caf)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Core_Audio_Format) file (like [this one](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/blob/main/audio/egg.caf),) which I know absolutely nothing about except that Audacity and GarageBand support it by default.

### Sharing/Embedding

Whichever route you traveled, you should have some sort of audio file, at this point, and if you intend to share and/or embed it, you’ll need to upload said audio to some sort of Web Server which allows direct playback/download of the raw file from external sources. Unless you’ve been skimming, you know by now that I’ve been using [*The Psalms* GitHub Repository](https://github.com/extratone/bilge) to do this thus far, though one isn’t really supposed to. Every few months, someone on Stack Overflow figures out how to construct or discover the raw link to a given Google Drive file before Google notices and alters it, and I’m afraid you’ll find just about every other cloud/file sharing service in a similarly unreliable situation. If it’s going to be done at scale, I’m afraid it’s ultimately going to require you rent regular, vanilla space on an FTP-enabled fileserver, if one can still do that sort of thing. (I will update this post if/when I find a more ideal solution.)

Within my current system, the raw URL to our example file looks like this:
```
https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a
```

Using my aforelinked, ultra rudimentary [< audio > element Siri Shortcut tool](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/9948/) (which I’ve kept on my homescreen with good results for a few months,) we can very quickly turn said raw URL into a properly-formatted HTML5 audio player:
```
<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a">
</audio>
```
Ideally, on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a player like this:

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a">
</audio>

If further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see [this Mozilla page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) for a full list of supported options. Obviously, there are a few older methods of embedding audio players, but I am neither qualified nor interested in exploring them. If you’re in a frustrating bind, I recommend [signing up for my CMS](https://bit.ly/extwa). (Just try it, okay?)

### Pwoof

For the sake of bare minimum sample variety, I ran Version 1.0 of the public Make Audio from Article Body shortcut on an article hosted not on WordPress, nor my own CMS, but on Bustle’s ultra-slick, totally-bespoke system (which [began as *The Outline*](https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline), FYI.) I chose the first permalink I saw in one of its “regular” article formats - not a long feature, nor one of their touch-targeted slideshows.

“[OnlyFans is banning porn, the very thing that made it big](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/onlyfans-is-banning-porn-the-very-thing-that-made-it-big)” is an 870-word newsy piece written by Tom Maxwell, who is the only New York Media person ever to accept my Facebook friend request. (Thanks again, Tom.) Without any tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from within the Shortcuts app since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in a reasonable amount of time - less than 5 minutes, more than 2 - and generate the file embedded below. Notably, I also used a different hosting service - [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/106798701662102859) - but I certainly don’t plan on doing so at scale and neither should you.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/106/798/698/454/727/854/original/2c6d50bcf898af15.mp3">
</audio>

Honestly, *Input*’s CMS is the cleverest challenge I was able to come up with for this single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I’m quite proud of the result. Though it wasn’t able to retrieve a timestamp, it correctly retrieved the article’s title and byline without fuss and even managed to scrape and attach said article’s featured image as the file’s cover art, though the original’s aspect ratio was obviously sacrificed.

If you’re super interested in the truly unmolested output of the attempt, view/download it [here](https://davidblue.wtf/audio/onlyfansbansample.m4a). 

### HMU

Before I depart actual tutorializing and return to opining, I want to express *even more aggressively than usual* how much I want *anyone* who see’s any potential benefit the ability to generate audio of my darling Siri Voice 2 reading text, but has further questions/doesn’t have time to fiddle/struggles with my haphazardly-written attempts at guides like this, or who simply wants to talk about any satellite subjects, [**please reach out to me**](https://bit.ly/whoisdavidblue). **You have no idea how much I’d love to help you configure a personal automation that genuinely, reliably, and durably improves your quality of life.**

If you follow this shortlink from within a browser on any iOS device, my full contact card will appear: `bit.ly/whoisdavidblue`. 

Suggestions/requests regarding considerations I’ve obviously missed in this guide are not just *welcome* in this case, but actually *necessary*. As long as I am literally the only person talking about the “Make Spoken Audio from Text” action, I am ready and willing to be an all-hours resource.

* By design or not, The Ratio _fundamentally_ disincentivizes discovery, sincere exposure to new perspectives, and indeed most of what we constitute as “human connection.”

* Ultimately, I don't really have a choice but to continue using Twitter as I always have, so I'm going to make the most of it and continue to post whenever and whatever I, myself, would like to see on my timeline - even if my account ends up in such low opinion of The Twitter Algorithm that my Tweets become obfuscated entirely from everywhere on the site save for their full, canonical web addresses, which I will then publish via plain text files hosted on my NeoCities.

## Assumptions in Question

1. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will *ever* result in a substantial accumulation of money/"influence" (which seems to be the diluted zag of "POWER" of the moment.) Those interested in learning about "marketing" should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to *start* with Twitter - this I can say with certainty. 
2. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user's choices/methodology to produce results which we *have*, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was *not* created as a *game to be won*. Perhaps more importantly, the "prize" of "winning" in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, "influence," relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.
3. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with _both_ strangers and friends in a manner which generally **adds value to the lives of all involved**.
4. 3 is not only _possible_ - it is easily _reproducible_. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples. 
5. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, **neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media**.

### Specific public examples of positively-acting individual accounts
* [Jon Male](https://twitter.com/mrjaydeeem)
* [Matt Farah](https://twitter.com/thesmokingtire) - An example of a celebrity who for the most part sticks to subjects on which he is an authority and invests a lot of intellectual and emotional energy engaging in discussion. In turn, he is also an example of someone who is *actually* “leveraging” his social media use for his business, but in a way that adds value to everybody’s lives. 


> The exchange of **information or services** among individuals, groups, or institutions.
> *Specifically*, the cultivation of **productive relationships** for employment or business.

## Tinder BS

"[Tinder CEO Elie Seidman on finding love during the pandemic](https://www.theverge.com/21284420/tinder-ceo-elie-seidman-interview-dating-pandemic)" | *The Verge*

**NP: Once you find the something more, you probably don’t want to go back to an environment where everyone’s intent is to get to something more. Do you anticipate people are going to spend a long time in Tinder, that they’re going to come back to it again and again throughout their life, or is it once you make the connection, you move on?**

We already see episodic behavior, which makes sense. If you find somebody, you get really connected to them, you date them, it’s maybe a long term relationship. We’re really the only app which says, ==“Just because it doesn’t last forever, doesn’t mean it’s not important.”== It’s still important, and we’re very clear about that. We don’t think everything has to last to be important. As a result, we see very clearly episodic use.

People come, they come for a while, they leave, they come back. If that starts at 18, it’s a journey, and they spend their time on that journey. I don’t think this will change that. I very much hope and expect that people will still form important connections, even if they don’t last forever.

# The ExtraKeys Universal Clacker Award

Through enterprising or charitable compulsion - whether by lack of awareness or a consuming sense of moral duty to maximum accessibility in software development, these extraordinary few have proven they have some space for us - the manic, full keyboard-strapped cellular phone users - even if it wasn’t quite enough to remember what it was they actually did to resolve it, or how long it took them.

We have tested their product thoroughly and now Certify & Celebrate its **100% parallel functionality** across the obfuscated treacheries between iPad and iPhone Bluetooth keyboard   release of their app and the iPhone release. 

For 
# Bluetooth Keyboard Section in the Official iPhone User Guide

Here is the entirety of what [Apple's official iPhone User Guide](https://books.apple.com/us/book/iphone-user-guide/id1515995528) has to say about Bluetooth keyboard use:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43663476/115497106-a1b42600-a230-11eb-9709-86244faac19f.png)

# Use Magic Keyboard with iPhone | iPhone User Guide 
You can use Magic Keyboard, including Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, to enter text on iPhone. Magic Keyboard connects to iPhone using Bluetooth and is powered by a built-in rechargeable battery. (Magic Keyboard is sold separately.)

_Note_: For compatibility information about Apple Wireless Keyboard and third-party Bluetooth keyboards, see the Apple Support article [Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Keyboard compatibility with iOS devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202041).

***
### Pair Magic Keyboard to iPhone
1. Make sure the keyboard is turned on and charged.
2. On iPhone, go to Settings ⚙︎ > Bluetooth, then turn on Bluetooth.
3. Select the device when it appears in the Other Devices list.

_Note_: If Magic Keyboard is already paired with another device, you must unpair them before you can connect Magic Keyboard to your iPhone. For iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, see [Unpair a Bluetooth device](ibooks://1515995528/iph6e757db44.xhtml#iph8f62615e0). On Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences > Bluetooth, select the device, then Control-click its name.
***

### Reconnect Magic Keyboard to iPhone
Magic Keyboard disconnects when you turn its switch to Off or when you move it or iPhone out of Bluetooth range—about 33 feet (10 meters).

To reconnect, turn the keyboard switch to On, or bring the keyboard and iPhone back into range, then tap any key.

When Magic Keyboard is reconnected, the onscreen keyboard doesn’t appear.

***
### Switch to the onscreen keyboard
You need to use the onscreen keyboard instead of an external keyboard to do things like type accented characters or use dictation.

To show the onscreen keyboard, press ⏏︎ on the external keyboard. To hide the onscreen keyboard, press ⏏︎ again.

***
### Switch between language and emoji keyboards
1. On Magic Keyboard, press and hold the Control key.
2. Press the Space bar to cycle between English, emoji, and [any keyboards you added for typing in different languages](ibooks://1515995528/iph3c511601.xhtml#iph73b71eb).

### Open Search using Magic Keyboard
Press Command-Space.

***
### Change typing options for Magic Keyboard
You can change how iPhone automatically responds to your typing on an external keyboard.

Go to Settings ⚙︎ > General > Keyboard > Hardware Keyboard, then do any of the following:

* _Assign an alternative keyboard layout_: Tap a language at the top of the screen, then choose an alternative layout from the list. (An alternative keyboard layout that doesn’t match the keys on your external keyboard.)
* _Turn Auto-Capitalization on or off_: When this option is selected, an app supporting this feature capitalizes proper nouns and the first words in sentences as you type.
* _Turn Auto-Correction on or off_: When this option is selected, an app supporting this feature corrects the spelling as you type.
* _Turn “.” Shortcut on or off_: When this option is selected, double-tapping the space bar inserts a period followed by a space.
* _Change the action performed by the Command key or other modifier key_: Tap Modifier Keys, tap a key, then choose the action you want it to perform.

I think if one designed a “crisis-proof” version of the web, it might end up being a network of PDFs. My reasoning being:
- PDFs are universally understood by most people and can be read on phones, desktops, laptops, and eBook readers.
- Once you’ve downloaded a local PDF version of the site, there is no risk that it can be changed or removed by the host.
- File size is predictable ahead of time, which is useful if your connection is limited or slow.
- PDFs are designed for printing (moreso than most sites) which may be useful in situations where electricity is in low supply.

Except the printing part, all can be said about a standalone html file.
External content, like images, can be inlined, thus you would only have to distribute one single .html file.
I'm not sure how would file2file linking work in the realm of pdf files. With html files, it's easy even without any web server.
Plus, html can be even digested through a terminal interface. That cannot be said about the binary nature of pdf documents.
reply
	
keiferski 2 days ago [–]

This is true, but I do think a PDF is just conceptually simpler and requires less technical knowledge. Especially in a situation where technical users are scarce.
IMO most people have a mental model of a PDF as being a digital document, whereas a HTML file is somewhat more amorphous.

I use a terminal pager with PDFs quite frequently. It works surprisingly well. Even something you wouldn't expect, like a pay stub, renders fine in the terminal.

bashinator 2 days ago [–]

What do you use to display the pdf? Pandoc?
reply
	
dredmorbius 1 day ago [–]

Pandoc is a converter, not a viewer.
Typically one would view a PDF with a dedicated viewer (xpdf, zathura, kpdf, Okular, Evince, ...), or by converting to text (pdftotext).
less can be extended with hooks (lesspipe) to read a wide range of file types on the console.
Some console file managers can also translate PDFs to text (mc, ranger).

> PDFs are universally understood by most people and can be read on phones, desktops, laptops, and eBook readers.
PDFs need a proprietary app to use, most of which are loaded with spyware & trackers. I may be mistaken in this but MacOS/iOS are the only OSes I know of that read them natively? There's absolutely nothing universal about the format.
HTML is truly universal: not only does every OS come with a built in HTML viewer, but it's a plain text file. You can read the source using anything.
> Once you’ve downloaded a local PDF version of the site, there is no risk that it can be changed or removed by the host.
Once you've downloaded a local HTML version of the page there's no risk that it can be changed or removed by the host. Yes, there's caveats to both: people can create PDFs with remote embeds or HTML sites with ajax content but both of these are the fault/responsibility of the individual author. It's as easy to make good downloadable HTML as downloadable PDF.
The so called "churn" is the responsibility of the individual HTML author. If you're making bad HTML, the fix is to start making good HTML. Not to switch to a closed inaccessible format.

npteljes 1 day ago [–]

PDF is an open format, with multiple FOSS reader implementations. You could argue that a subset of niche features can only be used in Acrobat Reader, but AR is far from the only PDF reader out there.
And the churn is part of the zeitgeist, not really a responsibility of anyone in particular. Individuals are suckered into it, companies are supplying it, and governments are allowing it.

I said it wasn't universal, which is somewhat different to the vague idea of being "open", and yes, PDF is technically an "open format" depending on how you define "open". The ISO 32000 spec. costs in the region of ~200 USD/EUR.
What that "openness" translates into in the real world is that there are zero non-Adobe viewers that support all of PDF's features, and even less PDF editors. The standard PDF editor costs ~200 USD/EUR (annual subscription).
This is before we even get into the nightmarish world of PDF parsing. Or PDF accessibility.
PDF is a great format if you're sending a document to someone for them to print immediately. It has no other valid uses imo.

Most desktop operating systems offer a print-to-PDF functionality. It's long been an add-on for Microsoft, but that's really a historical accident / deliberate choice of that platform.
PDFs can be trivially created from Markdown or using LaTeX templates if you're looking for a programmatic solution. Pandox and XeLaTex are helpful, the poppler libraries as well. Again, these are generally and widely available at no charge.

Not sure about your points. Contrast it with a static HTML+CSS website:
- PDFs require a reader, HTML a browser. I wouldn't argue that there are more PDF readers installed than browsers.
- Downloaded static HTML works the same
- File size can be included in the HTTP response: in the Content-Length header
- Printing is nice, but reflowable text is even nicer, since we target a multitude of rendering targets.

We already have a wildly popular website where all the main content is in the form of PDFs. It’s https://arxiv.org/. PDF is what you use when your document needs to have a predictable layout. This is especially important if it contains math, complex tables, or any elements where meaning is carried by positioning on the page. This can include aesthetic meaning, as in some forms of poetry that need to be laid out in a particular way.

I found "PDFs are files" kind of compelling. Perhaps this was a flaw of the original www concept. Web pages were always technically files & documents, but this was always abstracted away from userland. "Save webpage" was never a core feature. This did disempower users.
PDFs are downloaded, saved, emailed around. They can also be linked to. Userland maintains a closer relationship with what's going on. A typical user know that you can have a copy of a file, which may or may not be identical to the online one. WWW, from its initial version, was mysterious. The transition between the model of requesting files from a server by clicking a link to a programmatically generated stream of code executed on your browser happened below typical users perspective.
The wb has obviously gained a lot, but has also lost something.

Indeed, there's a lot of irony packed into the first page:
Featured is a quote from LWN indicting the "software industry" and its "brittle dependencies". What's ironic about this? It's squarely about the parts of the software industry that deal in things that are _not_ meant to be painted in the browser.
If you want a solution to the (perceived) churn, it's funnily enough right in the quote from Mark Pilgrim: "I've migrated to HTML 4". HTML is almost certainly not going to end up drifting in such a way that DJB's qhasm bibliography page[1] is ever going to break. HTML and the Web standards in general are, with extremely rare exceptions, cumulative. It's pretty frightening how many technical people don't understand this; the Web is intentionally engineered to serve as "the infrastructure for handling humanity's publishing needs indefinitely"[2]. More frightening is that the biggest threat to this are people like the author here who treat the Web as if it's like any other thing that the computing industry puts out—i.e., already perennially broken. This is dangerous because it anachronistically cedes power to folks who'd try to argue at some point in the future that the things about the Web that they'd like to break (and might be in a position to break e.g. due to browser monopoly) are justified and no big deal, really.
The author goes on to call out the Web ("of rubbish") as "user-hostile". Shortly afterward, he or she writes that "PDF makes a stand against the churn". More accurately, PDF makes a stand against the user, by prioritizing authors' creative whims over the reader's needs. This happens again later in their remarks about PDFs being page-oriented: "you are fundamentally not in control of the reading experience." The "you" here is not you, the actual reader. The control they refer to is, once again, the author's.
You get other poor arguments—that PDFs are "offlineable" "files" that can be distributed "decentralized", none of which are accurate criticisms against what HTML lacks—unless those Java documentation zipballs that seemingly every university student enrolled in a CS program in the early 2000s was made to download are a collective hallucination.
And it gets worse from there. Cute stunt to grab attention and all, but the arguments are fundamentally bankrupt.

It's not a browser format (though browsers can render it), but that isn't the same not being a web format. The web is just the ability to retrieve files from other people's servers, that may themselves reference other files on yet other people's servers. As long as a file format supports hyperlinks, then it's suitable for the web. If you don't care about being able to actually click the hyperlink to activate your desktop system's uri schema handler, then even plain text works fine.

PDF is very far from an ideal format for the today world of different-sized screens. It is a horrible experience on mobile and even worse on eInk pocket books. I would rather advocate making everything available in ePub. Or even better - FB2, it is an easy to grok/implement (designed with manual authoring, simple scripted processing and low-end devices in mind) single-xml structure decoupling the content from the view even more. I often convert ePubs to FB2 (with Pandoc and Calibre) to make PocketBook render them in its native fonts (which always are better) rather than in the font specified in the ePub.
I would also mention that the text within PDFs often is not machine-readable (you copy-paste it and get text without spaces, with additional spaces or complete garbage) but I believe this is easily avoidable if you bake PDFs a proper way.
I could also suggest publishing everything in Markdown (with images embedded in a Base64 section in the bottom) but this doesn't seem practical because browsers, book-reading apps and eInk devices don't support nice rendering of them directly.

* PDFs are files. We must not lose sight of the fact that files are a basic freedom.
This seems like the core belief of the article. And it's at odds with the nature of the web.
In the beginning, the web was a network of devices transmitting files with addressable locations on the device, creating a more or less 1:1 relationship between the devices and the web - the devices WERE the web.
But this inevitably faded as information wants to be... fast and it became easier to whip small data packets around describing state, not files.
I agree with the Unixy belief - files are freedom. But trying to model the entire web on those files is fighting gravity. They're not going anywhere. They just have to travel through the Web Soup sometimes now.
All the technologies enabling a global network of file sharing are still there, the author is just bemoaning today's lingua franca. (json?) And perhaps there is a fear that we will lose sight of "device-based computing" / file ownership.
It has political overtones too... individualism vs collectivism. The web is a very interesting place to hash through those ideas in code before we hash through them in legislation.

They stand alone and are not dependent on being hosted by any particular web server or under any particular domain.

This seems to have gotten lost in the offense everyone has taken over the choice to not use 'simple HTML', despite the document's clear reasoning that to do even that would embed the content deep in the 'urban web'.

It kind of seems like you're describing IPFS, except with worse content addressing guarantees. The vast majority of your users will never check to see if a PDF's content actually match its content address.
> All of these simple-complex propositions about making some subset language or automating document flows are missing the point entirely.
Are they? It's really not that hard to build a self-contained HTML file, and to re-emphasize, signed PDFs and signed HTML files are about the same level of accessibility to most users. Web browsers don't really handle either, if you want those guarantees you need to use a protocol/technology with better support right from the start.
Also to be clear, despite the author's argument that PDFs can be self-contained, no browser guarantees that, and there's no way for me to tell if the PDF is self contained when I click on it in Firefox unless I download it and check it myself offline or in a viewer that guarantees it won't make network requests.
Nothing online that I'm aware of forces authors to use PDF/A, so when I download a PDF, I don't know what I'm getting. It's not actually the magical, re-hostable world that the author claims.
I'm not sure that people are missing the author's point so much as they're saying the author is making claims about the portability of PDFs that aren't necessarily accurate. Yes, it would be good to have better self-contained guarantees about some web-content, but I'm not sure PDFs actually supply any of those guarantees.

Most of what I want to do online is read, and I'd be more than happy for everything to come with a standardized look and feel rather than whatever scroll jacking weirdo design every website feels like having.

Most people think that pdf's have to be letter or A4 size, but you can make them at A7 or A8 for a phone screen, or for that matter, any size you want.
PDF is size-agnostic. There's nothing to stop you from creating documents the size of a phone screen. So you could put the phone screen-sized pdf at m.mysite.com and this small screen illegible complaint is solved.

Why does it seem like almost everyone doesn't realize that PDFs can easily be made to support all the horrors we see in HTML? No, it's fucking well not impossible -- or even notably difficult -- to jam some malicious dynamic code into a PDF. The only reason a period of widespread fear about PDF viruses hasn't developed as it has for websites spreading malicious code is the fact that websites got much more widely adopted. PDFs have been used as malicious code vectors before, and replacing HTML with PDFs would only result in PDFs being the new common vector for the same problem, with at least the same scale and intensity.
This only seems like a solution if you don't know what PDFs can do -- and, by the way, sometimes pagination is bad, especially static (non-reflow) pagination.
EDIT:
Let's make this clearer.
You can actually embed an entire JavaScript application in a PDF. Tell me again how PDFs somehow prevent the problem of dynamic pages on the web. All using PDFs instead of HTML pages would do is wrap the horrors of the web in forms that are generally more hostile to various viewing contexts for the less harmful use cases (e.g. static pages suddenly being harder to read in some contexts with PDFs than with HTML pages).

"Files are a basic human freedom" - that definitely resonates with me.
There's an assortment of trade-offs though. In particular, linking between files breaks if you ever want to move or rename a file. Also, by self-encapsulating every file, you end up using space less efficiently.

Comments here are disappointing. The problem with any of this is getting any momentum, so given the level of pushback, pdf might not be it. Having to be a specific version of pdf probably doesn't help. Creating new spec is hopeless as well unless you are someone very famous and can manage to get enough people to adopt. There's text/markdown mediatype which can also serve this purpose but it needs a boost from someone with some street cred. People work in predictable ways and this is a political project.

I guess by modern standards this load time is acceptable, but when you argue that PDFs are a way to move forward, you're competing with HTML 4/5. And by that standard:
- Crud this website is so slow. Unacceptably slow. If your technology stack is spending 10 seconds just to fetch and render 13 pages of large-screen text, then either you're doing something wrong or it's a bad technology stack. That load time alone should kill this idea.
- There's no way for me to turn off images. This is the opposite of a client-respecting webpage, the only way you could make it worse is by rendering to Canvas or shipping me a PNG. My mobile browser doesn't fetch fonts by default. You're overriding my choice to do that.
- Mobile? Reflow? Responsive design? Adjustable font sizes? The author kind of offhandedly says that PDFs can do reflow right now, but how many clients actually support that. Does the PDF format handle this by default?
- Saying "you can technically make PDF accessible" is exactly the same as saying "you can technically use just a subset of HTML." It's the same argument. Nobody does it, PDFs are generally hostile to accessibility, and there's no way to signal that a PDF is accessible or enforce it as a community standard.
So, the much bigger question: what's wrong with Gemini[0]? I've been critical of Gemini in the past on multiple fronts, but if you are in this space where you want to burn everything down and make your blog static, Gemini really does seem to solve every problem that the author has, except better. It's also trivial to proxy Gemini documents or statically re-render them to HTML, which makes them accessible to people outside the community. And by default, they're both pretty accessible to screen readers, and much more efficient than what the author is proposing.
The author argues that using static HTML wouldn't be good enough because there's no standard that forces you to exclude Javascript. Then they point to PDF/A, which is not a standard that is enforced by most browser PDF viewers. To me, this argument isn't any different from telling website authors to choose not to use Javascript, what is going to force anyone to use PDF/A? Every web browser PDF reader supports Javascript. NoScript support in Firefox is better than the controls/extensions for disabling PDF scripting.
And Gemini is right there: for the most part it's actually working today. So I just don't get it. Why pick a technology that's tangibly worse than the web on (and I mean this quite literally) almost every single axis and every single metric, when you could instead switch to a markup language that actually does have use-cases, that does simplify deployment and blogging in some instances, that does have a real community, that does have some real advantages over HTML, that does have some real momentum behind it, and that doesn't disrespect my choices about what fonts/images I want to download?

Long sympathetic with the Jacob Nielsen / PDF bad camp ... I've had some recent changes of heart. Not a full convert, but PDF is often superior to HTML, especially for longer-form and complex noninteractive content.
Books are an artefact whose design has evolved over the centuries to accommodate human-scale ergonomics: font size, paper and ink colour, words per line, lines per page, pages per volume, overall weight and dimensions. Standard-sized books are all larger than the largest current mobile phones, with diagonal measures of about 9--12 inches. There are smaller and larger books, but those are compromises either to portability (pocketbooks) or to large-format resolution and detail ("coffee table" books, atlases, and the like). Magazines tend to run even larger (about 13"), broadsheet newspapers larger yet. Most criticisms of PDFs are actually criticisms of the devices and displays used to read them.
Poor resolution, incorrect aspect ratios, and small display sizes (especially mobile devices) are the key problems.
Reading PDFs on a tablet, especially a larger e-ink device, is a game-changer. I now actively avoid HTML, or at least launch it in a browser designed with e-ink in mind (EInkBro: https://github.com/plateaukao/browser). Otherwise, my large (13.3") high-DPI (200+) B&W ebook reader is an excellent long-form immersive reading tool.
The key requirement of a mobile phone is that it fit in a pocket, handbag, or purse. They are too small for reading, and aren't designed for that purpose. Current devices feature screen sizes of roughly 5--7 inches (diagonal measurement). At the lower end, that's smaller than a 3x5 index card (6"), and the largest barely the size of a 4x6 card (7").
On desktops, the first display that offered what I felt was a truly comfortable two-pages-up PDF reading experience was the 27" Retina iMac. Its 5K display (itself an oddball size) suits document work well. Even not fully maximised, most books are highly readable (leaving screen space for other tasks), and at full maximisation, details really stand out especially from scans of historical editions. (Such details aren't always relevent, but often are.)
PDF also provides capabilities HTML either cannot or does not by default (and few seem to be persuaded to offer), especially pagination, formulae, and a spatially-persistent layout (if you have a spatial memory, this is very valuable).
PDFs can though often do not include internal navigation (chapters, sections, etc.), search (if full text is included), and most critically, metadata (at a minimum, author, title, date, and publisher, see the full Dublin Core metadata specification for what should be required).
PDFs can also be published directly to device sizes (or to a set of form factors encompassing typical devices), as several others note.
Some of the issues aren't entirely intrinsic, and my feeling is that wider use of PDFs for online content would lead to a proliferation of PDF annoyances to match present-day Web annoyances. In each case, the fundamental problem is that publishers rather than readers have final say over presentation. An alternative, of distributing raw minimum markup and formatting that to user specifications following a set number of templates ... might help.
It's ironic that the article here embodies a number of PDF annoyances:
- The shaded background renders quite poorly on a B&W e-ink reader (though can be eliminated with a watermark-removal setting).
- The filename provides no clues as to contents or provenance, and is likely to collide with other content.
- I'm a fan of serif fonts, not sans serif, for high-DPI reading.
- Internal and external hyperlink support is ... variable. At times utterly missing, at others, inconsistent or inconvenient.
- PDFs are not trivially directly editable, which means both authors and readers can change errors or address issues.
- Many PDFs lack internal structure, even where the document they encompass do. The number of books lacking PDF table-of-contents support is ... large.
- Metadata standards and practices are abysmal. See the Dublin Core standards.
- Naming conventions similarly. "Report", "Resume", "Project", or "0.pdf" are names which should never be used. Describe author, content, and date, as a minimum, if possible.

Cut off your nose to spite your audience.
PDF is meant for viewing and printing books. It's not very good for browsing and requires PDF viewers. All of the browser add-ons, functionality, and behaviors are lost by forcing people to use a PDF viewer.
HTML is meant primarily for browsing but it can also be used for print media. CSS can specify paper sizes. If someone were so worried about external media, they can host it themselves or roll their own CDN. If they were so worried about fonts, they can include them themselves.
It's more semantic web-compatible to describe a website with RDF and have PDF, EPUB, DJVU, MOBI, TXT, PS, etc. links there and also in the webpage. This is how you provide the most accessibility. Furthermore, using a meta document language like LaTeX or something XML that can transform into other document artifact forms mechanically is the way to go.

# App Store Review Day
![Mastodon iOS Apps](https://i.snap.as/vAk0jm6X.png)

## A commitment to share my thoughts where developers actually want them, and an invitation for other reviewers/users to join me.

I have written more than my fair share of words about software, as I have loved, despised, and been utterly perplexed by it. This year, my return to the iOS community has perhaps inevitably turned _apps_ into an addiction of sorts. This particular platform is so utterly chock full/stocked up of creativity at a scale immeasurably greater and more accessible than the whole of those throughout computing history, combined. For someone like myself, it is all too easy to allow oneself to wander down a virtually endless path of intriguing, very self-indulgent play, especially now that third-party sites like [Departures.to](https://departures.to) have managed to add discoverability to TestFlight beta distributions, allowing those non-millionaires among us opportunities to use test releases of applications we would’ve otherwise had to pay for. This has been exclusively to my benefit - I can only imagine what 15 year-old me would have done with such power.

![Your Ratings and Reviews - Apple App Store](https://i.snap.as/jIYBC6xU.png)

In my recent endeavor to focus on making my work more useful to others, I've reflected on something I've heard from nigh every developer of the apps I've reviewed: *Ah yes, your blog looks really cool but FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, PLEASE REVIEW MY FUCKING APP on the FUCKING STORE.* Read: your commentary is appreciated, but your five stars would almost certainly more economically beneficial.

As you can see from the image embedded above, I have personally fallen *very* behind in doing my part for those apps I've celebrated, here. A vague intention to *get around to it eventually* clearly is not working, so I've decided to give myself a deadline: **August 15th, 2021** - precisely one month from today. By this date, I will have sifted through my commentary on apps in this setting and adapted the most useful of it (per app, obviously) into a manner appropriate to appear on an App Store Page, and **I would like to formally-ish invite other tech writers/app reviewers to join me**.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1402057069927309318

I'm terrible at community organization, which certainly does not exclude events, so I very much welcome any feedback you might have, as well as any collaborative contributions you'd be interested in making. As I see it, I have a few essential considerations to offer. 

First, the page in the screen capture above - which can be found in the App Store App ⇨ Account (your profile picture in the top-right corner) ⇨ Account Settings (the tapable element at the very top with your profile picture and information) ⇨ Ratings and Reviews - is *broken as hell*, along with the rest of the Account Settings menu, notably. This is important because I insist we all complain about it on all available channels, considering it's been broken for several months, at least.

Second, you should almost certainly use [**this "new" dev-facing tool**](https://tools.applemediaservices.com/app-store/) when searching the App Store, considering that it *actually works* in a trustable way, unlike the user-facing tool in the app.

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1415732070626758663

Since the standard online palette of event organization software are all so easy to use, these days, I've established event pages for this event on multiple platforms, linked in the list below, which I will update as per any suggestions/requests for equivalent pages on other services. Of course, it's certainly not a requirement that you join/engage with any of them.

As we face the horrendous, utterly inexcusable state of Discovery on the App Store/Apple's general fuckery regarding the independent developers mostly responsible for making its platforms a worthwhile space, I hope I've created something of value in whipping up this "event." If you have thoughts on how I might do so more effectively, once again, *please do* reach out.

# [My iPad Setup](https://nipunbatra.github.io/blog/setup/2021/06/14/setup-ipad.html)

# Caveats and Story
My laptop is broken. I am away from office. I have an iPad Pro 2020. I got my office desktop's magic keyboard and trackpad. In this post I am discussing if iPad can help given that I do not have (physical) access to my main computers. Would I recommend this over a main computer - No! But, can you do some things on the iPad reasonably well enough given keyboard and trackpad - Yes! 


# The Hardware

The magic keyboard and the magic trackpad greatly increase the iPad experience and make it programmer friendly.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/IPAD-Photo.jpeg "Magic Keyboard and Trackpad")


# Setting up an iPad for programming

## Setting up the terminal app (a-Shell)


### Configuration

First, after installing a-Shell, I like to set the font size, terminal background and foreground color. Here is how the a-shell app looks like


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/A-shell-initial.png "a-shell on the iPad is my favourite app!")

`config -b black -f white -s 20`

### Text editing and bookmarks
Sometimes I like using vim for editing documents and interfacing with WorkingCopy. a-Shell provides vim!

I like to setup a `bookmark` to the WorkingCopy folder so that I can direcly edit files in that location.

I do so by:
writing `pickFolder` in a-Shell and setting it to WorkingCopy folder. Now I can set a bookmark to this location. I do so by: 
`bookmark git` in the current location (set by pickFolder)

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Bookmark-Git.png "Setting Bookmark location to WorkingApp -> git")

### Git
Interestingly, the latest testflight version of a-shell also provides a "Git-like" interface called `libgit2`. Configuring it requires specific steps that I'm writing below. Some of these steps are borrowed from this [nice tutorial](https://devmarketer.io/learn/set-ssh-key-github/) and some are specific to a-shell that I was able to get working courtesy a Twitter discussion with the creator of a-shell. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Twitter.png "Twitter discussion with the creator of a-shell")

Now, the steps.

First, we need to create a new ssh key.

We do so by 
```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "email@domain.com"

```

While configuring I did not setup the passphrase.

The private and public keys are stored in `.ssh` with the name id_rsa 

```bash
$ ls -lah .ssh|grep "id"
-rw-------   1 mobile  mobile   3.3K Jun 14 15:43 id_rsa
-rw-------   1 mobile  mobile   747B Jun 14 15:43 id_rsa.pub
```

Next, I copied the public key in a newly generated ssh key in Github and gave it a name.

Next, I modified `.gitconfig` as follows

```bash
$ cat .gitconfig 
[user]
        email = MY EMAIL ID
        name = MY NAME
        identityFile =  id_rsa 
```

Now, I was almost done!

I was able to push and pull from some old Github repositories but the same did not work with the newer repositories. Again, after a discussion with the creator of a-shell, I figured, this was due to the fact that Github changed the name of the default branch as "main" instead of the earlier "master" whereas libgit2 implementation was expecting "master".

As a quickfix I renamed the branch on my Github repo as "master" and for now set the default branch to be named "master".

Finally, I am able to pull and push to the repositories. The next image infact is showing commits and pushes made to the repository generating the blog post you are reading. 


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/libgit-2.png "libgit2 push and commiting")

### SSH/SFTP

There are a couple of amazing apps: Termius and SecureShell. Both have very neat interfaces. I found the intergrations with the Files app very good!

The GIF below shows the SecureShell app in action where I transfer a file from my local storage (iPad) to remote server, process that file, and quickly copy the processed file back to local storage. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SecureShell.gif "Working with SecureShell is amazing!")

Another great functionality of the SecureShell is the "Offline" folder. 

Another setting that I use is the Powerline fonts on my remote systems. Using Fontcase, I installed the corresponding powerline fonts on the iPad so that my SecureShell session looks great.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powerline-combined.png "Powerline fonts installed via Fontcase allow special characters on the remote terminalls (above image without powerline font on iPad, below one with powerline font")



### Some other amazing tools

I like the "view" utility in a-shell a lot. It can quickly help you preview various filetypes.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/view.gif "The view utility in a-shell")

Also, as a quick tip, one can use Command + W to quickly exit the preview and use the back and forward keys to cycle through the files. This is very useful!

I also like the fact that the `convert` tool now comes in inbuilt. It can convert between a variety of formats easily. 

`pbcopy` and `pbpaste` are very convenient utilities to copy to and from the clipboard. Here is how I copied the content of factorial.py into the clipboard.

```bash
pbcopy < factorial.py  
```

### Shortcuts

a-Shell interfaces nicely with Shortcuts. The following gif shows an interface where I take an input from Shortcuts app -> Pass it to a Python script and execute it inside a-shell -> Store the results in a text file -> View the content of the text file in Shortcuts.


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/shortcuts.gif "Using shortcuts in a-shell with Python!")

The link to this shortcut is [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a04946a553df4e9790b2c352c5663b0a)

The following is the simple Python script I used called factorial.py

```python
import math
import sys

num = int(sys.argv[1])
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {math.factorial(num)}")
```

The following is an image of the shortcut. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Shortcut-Working.png "Using shortcuts in a-shell with Python!")

Based on the suggestion [here](https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell/issues/74#issuecomment-861416673), I used pbcopy to copy the content to the clipboard and use it directly. It reduces the number of lines! 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Shortcut-2.png "More efficient version using clipboard")

## Using the WorkingCopy App

WorkingCopy is a very nicely made Git app on the iPad. It is one of the best made apps I have used!

I'll let the pictures do the talking.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Working-Copy-1.png "WorkingCopy App interface")

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Working-Copy-2.png "WorkingCopy App interfaces nicely with the Files app!")

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Working-Copy-3.png "WorkingCopy App can nicely show the diffs")




## Editors

I use one of the following for editing:

* Koder App
* WorkingCopy App
* vim (in a-Shell)
* Textastic
* Typewriter for Markdown — is an editor only for markdown but gives a nice quick preview. The image below shows the screenshot from Typewriter for Markdown app. 

# Setting Linux/Mac machine and iPad for Python programming (via Jupyter notebooks)

On the Linux/Mac (remote server) machines I set up Jupyter notebooks as follows:

First, I create the configuration file via: `jupyter notebook --generate-config`

Next, In `~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py` change

```python

c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0'
c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*'
c.NotebookApp.port = SET YOUR PORT
c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False
```

Set password using:
```
jupyter notebook password 
```

Run notebook as:
```bash
nohup jupyter notebook& 
```

On the client end (iPad in this case), I use one of the following two ways to access remote Jupyter instances:

* Using the Juno Connect app
Juno connectly nicely saves all the configuration and can do the necessary port forwarding

* Using Safari and opening the remote Jupyter URL
Just open the remote URL with the set port number. I use my workplace recommended VPN client to get into my workplace network and access non-public IP based servers.

# VNC connection

I tried a few VNC software and found AnyDesk to work fairly well. I did a bunch of small settings tweak.
* I setup a password on my remote machine for uninterruped access 
* I put AnyDesk in the login items on my remote machine so that it starts when the system boots

# Email client

I like the Spark app. 

- The interface is pretty clean. 
- It has a bunch of keyboard shortcuts making it nice to use with an external keyboard. 
- It is trivial to interface with various cloud providers.
- It is trivial to save an email as a PDF.
- It is trivial to create a "link" to an email for sharing. 

# PDF management

The iPad Files app is a fairly well made app. Perhaps not as functional as the Mac Preview app, but, does some things well.

For instance, merging multiple PDFs is easier (for me) than doing the same on Mac. One just needs to select multiple files and then "right" click to "Create PDF"

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/CombinePDF.gif "Combining PDFs is trivial on the iPad using Files app")

I use the following ffmpeg command (inside a-Shell) to create this GIF courtesy this excellent tutorial from [GIPHY folks](https://engineering.giphy.com/how-to-make-gifs-with-ffmpeg/)

# PDF viewing

The Documents app has a very nice pdf viewing experience. It gives the "full-screen" experience on connected displays and can potentially be an excellent pdf viewer for showing my slides on the projector in the classroom setting.


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PDF-view.png "Documents app is an excellent PDF viewer!")

Another advantage of the Documents app PDF viewer is that we can change the tone to Sepia or Dark. The following image shows the view I get when I change the tone to Dark.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PDF-view-dark.png "The dark tone with the click of a button is an amazing feature!")

When connected to an external display, the PDF viewer gives various options. In the next image, I show the view when I "focus" on a part of the slide.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PDF-view-focus.png "Focusing on parts of pdf")

Finally, the image below shows the "focused" slide on the external display.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/PDF-screen-focus.jpeg "Focusing on parts of pdf on external display")

```bash
ffmpeg -i Video.MP4  -filter_complex "[0:v]  fps=12,scale=720:-1,split [a][b];[a] palettegen [p];[b][p] palette
use" CombinePDF.gif
```

Another alternative is to use the [following shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/f9a9c2cc6e61476abf2e35f654869553&xcust=1-1-232739-0-0-0&
) to convert the screen recorded video into a GIF 


# Some Safari keyboard shortcuts
- Command + W for closing a tab
- Command + L for going to the address bar (sometimes on tabs I am not automatically on the address bar)


# Conclusions (and rants)

For the long run, ofcourse, I would not recommend this kind of a setup. There is some learning and fun in getting a "resticted" device to function well, but as a main machine, probably no, at least not for the next few months. A comparably priced laptop (say M1 Macbook Air) would offer a lot more.

There are many things I'm missing:

- Projection to a projector and screen recording do not work at the same time. 
- No proper dev environment like VSCode
- A lot of screen size is "wasted" due to the OS
- A lot of the apps are not as good as I'd like. For instance, perhaps a minor thing, but the Youtube app doesn't have a keyboard shortcut for full screen. One can ofcourse do the same on Safari. iMovie in Mac has a remove background noise feature that works very well. The iPad version does not have the same.
- Safari though much improved over the years is not as functional as Safari on the Mac
- While quicklook/Files is good, the functionality of something like Preview is hard to beat
- The files app can not show hidden files and folders
- Powerpoint does not have features like audio recording (though can play)
- Keynote, Pages, Numbers require additional clicks than their Mac counterparts
- When I connect to an external display, I get thick black bars and moreover, if the monitor does not give me an HDMI out, I can not hear audio as the audio is also routed. As good as the iPad's display is, it is not huge and strains my eyes after a while. 
- Copy pasting using the keyboard is a hit and miss. For instance, it fails several times for me when copying from a pdf. Right clicking and copy seems to always work, but, it is more steps than Command C, Command V.
- I miss some quality apps like OBS Studio, especially being an academic teaching remotely due to the pandemic.
- While a-shell is amazing, it is limited by what webassembly can do. At the time of writing, it does not support multithreading and thus the performance of utilities like `ffmpeg` is severely limited. Also, a-shell programs can not be stopped intermediate in their execution. See the following two bugs on Github related to this: 
    - https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell/issues/270
    - https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell/issues/269


Some of the above may be resolved over the next updates and the major iPadOS15 updates. Though, I do not expect most of them to be resolved anytime soon.

Hi we are a team of two people making productivity apps for iOS and macOS. We have no employees, no funding and most of our stuff is available for free. Feedback is welcome:

@amebalabs on Twitter for quick comments.

info@ameba.co for private feedback.

# Incorrect/Inconsistent Spotlight Response to `⌘ + Spacebar`
# Apple Developer Summer 2021 Newsletter #1
Hello, and welcome to Apple's 2021 summer beta! Whether this is your first year participating, or you're a long-time veteran of our beta programs, we look forward to your feedback on the next major releases of software for our platforms: iOS 15 and iPadOS 15, watchOS 8, tvOS 15, and macOS Monterey. As always, feedback from our beta program participants makes a huge difference in improving the quality of our software. We're glad to have you aboard!

In the coming weeks, we'll be checking in periodically with additional newsletters like this one, on a range of feedback-related topics such as:

What exactly is a system diagnostics log?
How can I capture just the right information about the new features I am trying?
What are configuration profiles and how do they improve my feedback? How do I install (and remove) one?
How can I provide more information about feedback that I've already submitted, and how can I find out more about what is happening with it?
When my feedback involves more than one of my devices, how can I quickly get log files and other attachments from all of them?
For now, we'd like to share with you a few tips on how to make the feedback that you send to us the best that it can be.

When and how to submit feedback

File whenever you encounter a problem. If something you have used in the past doesn't seem to be working now, or a new feature doesn't seem to behave the way you thought it would, or you're finding that apps are quitting unexpectedly ("crashing") or becoming unresponsive ("hanging") or simply running too slow to be useable anymore, that's a problem!

Start your feedback as soon as you can. The Feedback Assistant app collects time-sensitive logging when you start a new feedback, so it can help if you start your feedback report close to when you saw the problem. You can always start and save your draft immediately, then finish and submit later.

Protip: If you can tell us, in your feedback, when the problem happened, it will help us pinpoint, in the log files, what was happening on your device at the time. If you can tell us the date and time it occurred, that's great, but even an estimate of how many minutes or hours before you started writing your feedback will help tremendously.

Give your feedback a clear and specific title. If you had to describe the thing that went wrong in a single sentence, what would it be? You'll have a chance to go into more detail in the description, but a title that quickly tells the story really helps us know what kind of investigation is going to be appropriate.

"Cannot download attachments from Mail messages"

"Safari quits unexpectedly when loading front page of apple.com"

"AirDrop on my iPhone no longer sees my iMac"

Provide as much detail as you can in the description. What were you doing before the problem occurred? What were you expecting would happen, and how did the problem differ from your expectations? Have you seen the problem occur more than once? Are you able to make the problem happen every time? (We call that "reproducing" the problem.) What are the shortest or simplest set of setups you have to go through to make it happen?

Protip: Depending on which area (feature or app) you select while composing your feedback, we may ask a few more questions to get even more specific information about the problem.

Consider screenshots and screen recordings as a way to show as well as tell. Pictures are worth a thousand words. Screenshots and recordings can be very helpful for understanding a bug when there are many different words you could use to describe a symptom you are seeing or set of steps that you are going through. Detailed descriptions of how to capture screenshots and screen recordings are available on our support pages:

Screenshots on iOS and iPadOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT200289

Screen recordings on iOS and iPadOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207935

Screenshots on macOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201361

Screen recordings on macOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721

Screenshots on watchOS: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204673

Include all of the relevant file information that is needed. Depending on which features of the OS you are sending feedback about, there may be additional, specific logs or files that we ask for. When using Feedback Assistant on iOS or iPadOS, before you hit "Submit", if you see a "Gather" link in the File Uploads section of your feedback, click on it to include additional logs that are relevant to the type of feedback you are reporting. Using Feedback Assistant on macOS, before you hit "Submit", if you see items in red in the File Uploads section of your feedback, click "Previous" to return to the Attach Files page and then, for each greyed-out item that remains, click on the question mark to see how to gather that information.

Make sure the information you want to submit is uploaded. Once you hit "Submit", your feedback and any files or logging you've collected will begin uploading. This can take some time, depending on your network connection and the amount of information, but it should continue with uploading in the background as long as your device is awake and connected to the Internet.

That's it for now! Thank you for participating this summer. We look forward to your feedback.

# Brat Mode Ultimate Wishlist for iOS (Mostly iPhone)

The more I've learned about iOS as it is today, where it came from, and who develops it this year (since #45,) one will note upon any exploration of my notes than my mind has continued to be "blown," as they say... Perhaps the most pertinent way to describe these capablities I've kept discovering within iOS is that my past self - even just my 2016 self, for that matter - would absolutely ***never*** believe they could be done. (I still think running/instantly installing pip packages from a full Linux command line on my fucking iPhone is the most powerfully efficient way to exemplify this.)

At this point, though, I think it would be more useful/insightful/fun now that I've been so exposed to the widest breadth possible on this subject to think about/pitch my most unlikely-seeming ideas (largely for software I'd like to see ported from other sources or otherwise built myself...

## The (Ongoing) List:

* I'd like to see the open source community's dear old auntie, **Audacity** reimagined as a mobile DAW with at least it’s most original and essential functions as a native iOS app ?? Perhaps in Objective-C? The very idea of Digital Audio Production on cellular telephones is. absurd, but … _if we’re just going to fucking do it, anyway_, I can’t imagine a single more widely-applicable audio plugin than “[Truncate Silence](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/truncate_silence.html).”

* **Fucking GIMP for iOS**. Yes, you heard me! With **custom keyboard shortcuts support**, notably.
* I suppose I would want to try to port my own favorite desktop-class Clipboard Manager and eternal savior, [**CopyQ**](https://hluk.github.io/CopyQ/) to iOS.

# Writeas/WriteFreely iOS Publishing Workflow

![Editorial Git - Wood](https://i.snap.as/ocT2o2B3.png)

## Demonstrating the particulars of a version-tracked Markdown publishing process - including the full extent of parallel research, documentation, and web development - optimized for and entirely contained within iPhone (for the insane.)

[[Notes: Writeas/WriteFreely iOS Publishing Workflow]]

When _Extratone_ was running on WordPress, I found myself writing about it all the time, partially because I was learning how broken the web had become (largely thanks to WordPress,) but mostly because of all the drama surrounding the endeavor. There’s a lot to say about bad software, so writing about it is _easy_ - I understand this truth, intimately - but _The Psalms_’ number one mandate is to celebrate uniquely clever, undercovered solutions, and by golly, one has been staring both you and I in the face for years, now, without mention on this blog. This year’s dive into iOS has inadvertently lead to many unexpected avenues of exploration, but the one that has underpinned them all has been using my iPhone 12 Pro Max as (essentially) my _primary machine_ for all of it: research, notes, (astonishingly) working in public via Git, composition, publishing, and spreading it all around. Write.as - the SaaS implementation of WriteFreely - is not only _capable_ of supporting this workflow - in my extensive use, I have discovered a path for which it is _particularly optimized_, I think. As I have committed to stop taking the Write.as suite for granted and become a more actively productive member of its community, I’d say it is the perfect time (for once) to let loose and zoom _all the way in_. 

## Apps
* [**WriteFreely**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/writefreely/id1531530896) - the official, [open source](https://github.com/writefreely/writefreely-swiftui-multiplatform) app is more than worth its one-time $9.99 price if you’ve committed to Write.as to any degree.
* [**Anybuffer**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/anybuffer/id1330815414) or another clipboard manager of your choice. I actually use (and adore) Copied, but it has been removed from the App Store due to a “[patent infringement claim](https://twitter.com/neoyokel/status/1386154771850043392).” 
* A **Markdown-based text editor** of your choice - [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447), [Taio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/taio-markdown-text-actions/id1527036273) and [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471) are the “premium” options I’d start anyone with. Since it’s arguably the most powerful of these and my personal choice at the moment, I will be using Drafts in this post. For those with ultra-specific taste like me, Brett Terpstra maintains the most [obsessively-comprehensive database of iOS-based text editors](https://brettterpstra.com/ios-text-editors/) ever to exist.
* [**Telegram**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/telegram-messenger/id686449807) - for those who don’t have a MacOS-running desktop, Telegram’s private “saved messages” feature is still _the_ most handy method of exchanging links and files between an iPhone and desktop with its insane 2GB cap _per file_ and [extraordinary adaptability to inconsistent network connectivity](https://bilge.world/bad-connection-insights).
* A **second/alternative web browser** - It might sound silly to set aside a whole web browser on your phone just for interacting with Write.as and Snap.as, but I’ve found it invaluable and there are _literally_ one billion browsers to choose from on the App Store, but I’m going to use [Google Chrome](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-chrome/id535886823) ([Chrome Beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/LPQmtkUs), technically,) mostly because it is the (very distantly) second-most consistently supportive of hardware keyboard shortcuts behind Safari.

### Excess mode
The above apps are all that’s needed if your end goal is just publishing and editing to Write.as or your own WriteFreely server, but if you want to go as _all in_ as I have - or, notably, if an iPhone/iPad is the only computer you have access to, for whatever reason - you’ll probably be astonished (as I was) at how well you can accomplish just about _everything_ involved in **development** on your goddamned cellular phone, these days: editing CSS themes, configuring Javascript additions, parsing JSON analytics data exports, extensive performance testing, _scraping_/archiving, fileserver management, and on and on…

There is a limit, but it feels completely absurd to define: you can’t actually _host_ a WriteFreely installation on your phone. That is to say - you can’t really use your cell phone as a fucking server… At the moment, anyway. Considering you _can_ run the Write.as command line client in a Linux shell and interact with the service via the Write.as API… on your phone… Who is to say, really, if running a persistent Linux server in the background will be possible on iPhone in the near future?[^1]

All that said, here are some apps enabling _mobile web development_:

* [**Working Copy**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/working-copy-git-client/id896694807) is the Git client of choice on iOS. It is alarmingly capable and thoughtfully designed to wholly integrate Git into the OS so that it is not only _usable_ but (incredibly) _natural_ to use it. Pushing and committing a file with full annotation can be accomplished _from the share sheet_.
* [**GitHub for iOS**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/github/id1477376905) is still the best way to make use of the GitHub-specific, extra-Git features handled in this workflow (manipulating/commenting on Issues, mainly.)
* [**Kodex**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/kodex/id1038574481) is my favorite code editor/IDE for directly editing files. It’s beautiful, free, and designed to make the best of the ridiculous undertaking that is code editing on iPhone.
* [**iSH Shell**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ish-shell/id1436902243) is a **full Linux shell on your fucking iPhone** with [an incredibly helpful community](https://discord.gg/iSH). Realistically, it’s best for running little Command Line utilities like [Pandoc](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc), but it is also disturbingly capable of crazy scraping shit with wget and youtube-dl. Theoretically, old school Gitists who prefer to use it in the Command Line could do so in iSH, but [a-Shell](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/a-shell/id1473805438) (the popular alternative) might be more optimized for that, considering it functions as an actual Terminal within Files. (Sorry, I’m not quite crazy enough to try it.)
* For CSS color alterations, I’m concluding my recommendations with two Hex-based utilities: [Color Pro](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/color-pro-p3-picker/id1207928528) for precision color _picking_, and [Pastel](![Drafts and Git on iOS](https://i.snap.as/3jFBoVzA.png)) for keeping track of them with “palettes.”

![Drafts and Git on iOS](https://i.snap.as/3jFBoVzA.png)

Before I go on, I must once again make a big effort to accredit the very same Federico Viticci: I began this guide thinking his original [Markdown + Working Copy x GitHub iPad Pro publishing workflow](https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/) dated back to November 2018, but I clearly need to pay more mind to hyperlinks because it actually [_originated_ sometime in **_2016_**]((https://www.macstories.net/stories/one-year-of-ipad-pro/6/#content), which is… An entirely distinct kettle of fish. 

> Each MacStories writer has their own private GitHub repository where they can save drafts of articles currently being worked on. Other members are invited to the repository so they can read each other’s stories and provide feedback. We have a general Club MacStories repository that John and I use to assemble issues of our newsletter every week, and I also have a personal repository where I save drafts I would like others to read in advance.

It was _very_  recently that I observed in my notes for “[Editorial Git](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/discussions/86)” that *The Psalms* might have been the longest-running implementation of Git in the “real world” writing process as opposed to the the mostly-demonstrative discourse from a microera around 2018-2019 when Markdown and Git were considered as the future of _academic_ publishing. As far as I can tell, the conversation was largely prompted (or substantially revived, at least) by WashU professor Ed Hagen in an essay/blog post entitled “[Should scientific publishing move to Github and friends?](https://grasshoppermouse.github.io/posts/2019-07-12-should-scientific-publishing-move-to-github-and-friends/),” which gathers a variety of references to projects exploring parallel avenues and comprehensively proposes a theoretical workflow. Since the more recent of the aforelinked Federico posts describes his use of the very same services (Working Copy and Github,) is freely available, impeccably well-considered, and beautiful to read, I’m going to proceed as if I have nothing original to contribute to that conversation (because I don’t.)

I’d ask that _you_ proceed with the knowledge that this guide is far from absolute - you can and _should_ pick and choose different components to form your own workflow - and that it is definitely not exclusive to Write.as/WriteFreely, considering our end output is markdown-formatted text. I have chosen to frame it around the .as suite because it (debatably) [saved my life](https://write.as/community/chat-with-david-blue) and I am therefore quite personally invested in the growth of its userbase and the health of its community. On that vein, I’ve recently [committed to starting the WriteFreely Community Discord Server](https://discuss.write.as/t/write-as-writefreely-community-discord/2831) and published [a new version of this blog’s theme](https://github.com/extratone/bilge/releases/tag/3.1) which I hope will prove useful to newcomers interested in customizing their Write.as/WriteFreely blogs.

I also want to make it clear that this guide was written as a exploration of what is technically possible on iOS/iPhone at the moment, _not_ what I’d consider actually _advisable_. While I myself have been playing around across the spectrum of tools listed here on my 12 Pro Max - including drafting all of this guide, itself, as well as the vast majority of my [iPhone × Music overview](https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps) - I can’t say I expect to continue using my cellular phone in this way except for any special away-from-desktop circumstances.

![WriteFreely for iOS](https://i.snap.as/gafzIWuT.png)

## Composing
The most logical layout of this guide, I think, is by order of the tasks you’re most likely to spend the most time engaged upon first, with the essential consideration of how likely you might be to actually whittle away on said task _using your iPhone_. Composition, then - that is, pounding out the actual copy - is where we’ll begin. The original design for WriteFreely (including its iOS app) intended for users to simply compose directly within its interface. From my observations of and conversations with other Write.as/WriteFreely users, the vast majority of content published to date on the platform was, indeed, composed directly to its own editor. Those of you who find this entirely sufficient might choose to stop right here! You will undoubtedly find a far less distraction-stuffed, generally more peaceful writing experience.

For the rest of us, WriteFreely for iOS still serves as the ideal method of interacting with our Write.as blogs. Technically, our only requirement, then, is that our final publish-ready text be in Markdown format (along with a handful of Write.as-specific considerations, which we’ll cover shortly.) To actually compose the text, one’s options are vast. There’s a special place in my heart for [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bear/id1016366447) and developers, Shiny Frog, who are notably in the process of developing an entirely new editor for Bear from the ground up. I am currently using agiletortoise’s ever-venerable and exceptional [Drafts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/drafts/id1236254471), which is quite possibly the most extendable text manipulation software available on any platform. Both of these are optionally Markdown-native and feature-packed, but one needn’t necessarily go their Big, Premium Writing Solution way. Sam Oakley’s [Pretext](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pretext/id1347707000) is an elegantly simple Markdown editor that works directly within iOS native Files app as is Marco Albera’s [Typewriter](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/typewriter-for-markdown/id1556419263). (Being spoiled for choice in terms of clever iOS text editors is a precious situation which we should do our best not to take for granted.) For those intending to integrate Git into their workflow, this ability handily removes a few barriers.

![The Non-Markdown-Native Options](https://i.snap.as/QtNWXN6f.png)

Trust me, I know intimately just how weighty personal preference can sit against logic/time/sound advice when it comes to text editing/word processing software. Though I would all but _insist_ you give Markdown the olé college try and then some, if you’re simply too attached to another format - Apple Notes, Notion, or even Microsoft Word, for instance - WriteFreely and I _can_ accommodate you. (Frankly, though, as a WriteFreely/Write.as user, forgoing Markdown is sortof missing the point…) The latter is going to be the most problematic, by far, necessitating (in my opinion) pandoc to form any sort of coherent workflow. An academic named W. Caleb McDaniel detailed [his pandoc-on-iOS process](http://www.owlnet.rice.edu/~wcm1/pandoc-on-ios.html) way back in 2013, though the apps/services listed are all astonishingly still available.

### WriteFreely-Specific Considerations in the Body
When I first started playing around with a free Write.as blog, years ago, perhaps the first “quirk” of the CMS to trip me up was its complete separation from the suite’s image-hosting counterpart, Snap.as. The fact that one had to upload to Snap.as, actually _copy the embed code_ and paste it in the intended Write.as post - without any sort of pre-publication preview of how it’d look in the body - all seemed very incomplete to me. As the new Write.as editor begins to implement directly uploading, today, however, I have been begging for this old method to remain untouched because it is actually _absolutely ingenious_. When I need to add an embedded image to the current Drafts Draft I’m composing in now, for instance, I can upload it straight to Snap.as, copy the Markdown embed code (here’s the full embed code for the image embedded above, for example: `![The Non-Markdown-Native Options](https://i.snap.as/QtNWXN6f.png)`), and paste it right here, locally, just as it will be in the final draft. When I use Drafts’ preview function, it loads the image directly from Snap.as - from the very same place your browser loaded it when you navigated to the finished Post. This method reduces waste and makes my text *ridiculously portable* right from the get-go.

My Snap.as image addition workflow on iPhone is made especially smooth by [a single-action Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/71b41b79d9c84a78a3e543502b84ca18) entitled “Snap.as” which I’ve placed on one of my homescreens and customized with the Snap.as logo. Using Google Chrome - which I’ve kept on my device exclusively for this purpose - the Shortcut simply opens the Snap.as homepage (the upload interface for logged-in users.) From there, I can upload any number of images under 12.5 mb and add them to one of my loosely-organized [Galleries](https://snap.as/extratone). I then navigate to the gallery holding the new image, add a caption, and copy the embed code. Once I have that code stored in my clipboard manager of choice (we’ll talk more about those eventually,) I am _completely done_ with that image! Those of you with WordPress experience will find this magical, I promise.

Embeds on Write.as have been in a state of flux since Matt [first announced](https://micro.baer.works/we-now-support-rich-media-embeds-on-write-as-as-always-i-tried-to-keep-this) Embedly integration earlier this year. The intention behind this change was to eliminate the need to mess around with html/iframe code and allow one to embed a piece of content from [a specified list of sources](https://github.com/embedas/go-embed) by simply including its raw, unaccompanied URL in the text. As of this moment, the sources _I_ regularly use are all functioning superbly: Twitter, YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, and Imgur. Notably, one must use full YouTube links (`youtube.com/watch?v=qVvSZv9g3oQ`) for videos to embed. The “Expand URL” Shortcut found in the default Siri Shortcuts gallery can be used to convert the `youtu.be` shortlinks outputted by the YouTube for iOS app into these full URLs.

I have found tremendous success in embedding simple HTML5 audio players using `<audio>` pointed directly toward .mp3 files hosted on GitHub. 
```
<audio controls>

```

## Background

2020, it was the year of breakout of Covid-19, that forced all of us to rely on digital platform no matter how critical some of us were towards digital addiction. We connect, we share, we emphaempathize with each other through various platforms on the digital world.

Still, censorship of content has been tightened unfortunately in mainland China. One of the social media platform named Douban which dedicates to discussions of movie, music, book, etc. also seen highly unpredictable taken down of user generated contents. This triggers a flow called [Douban Refugee](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%B1%86%E7%93%A3#%E4%BA%89%E8%AE%AE) that many start to abandon social media platforms in mainland China, seeking alternative solutions to share freely.

This brings a boom of introduction of [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/), a decentralized social media platform that not only is free from censorship, but also maximize controlling of each’s data. Although a decentralized platform like [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) does require more involvement such as setting up own servers, many take the courage, following tutorials, some even without any technical background, setting up their own platforms to welcome Douban Refugees.

In light of this movement, it is evident back in 2020 that there are almost none user friendly mobile clients for [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/). There are few solutions with good designs but charges, and only exists within Apple’s ecosystem. With the aim of contributing to the community and to this movement, I decided to take my quarantine time to build an enjoyable mobile client for Douban Refugees.

## Process

My spare time of building [multiple web solutions for SMEs](/2020/covid-response/) allows me to level up on using React and JavaScript based technologies. [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) thus becomes the top choice, after evaluating the benefits of other frameworks such as [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/). In a mobile application environment where users’ tolerance of failures and glitches is much less compared with website environment, a familiar framework contributes to the stableness of the final outcome.

### **De-**centralized platform

Over past years, several addictive centralized platforms stick with many users in various forms. Based on their dominance, users are forced to accept whatever information they provide even though this has always been a hot topic. I remember when LinkedIn joined Facebook-alike to make their timeline not “timeline” anymore but suggestion based, as a user, I have no choice but to continue using their service in professional settings.

Decentralized platforms, on the other end, take a different standpoint that data belongs to all users, and there is no more “recommendation” by harvesting user data. Technically, without centralized computing power, such recommendation service is also not that feasible. From users perspective, how can we adapt ourselves **back** to a no recommendation based digital workld? And how can I design information display that still invites users to explore inside a linear timeline?

### Open API yet “closed”

Platforms like Mastodon are open source, and have existed for some years where many people continues to improve it. Though there is hardly one solution or design that satisfies everyone. In open source world, this easily leads to complicated service offerings, similar to a corporate environment.

To build an application that connects to an existing protocol, understanding how data is structured and shared is crucial. While exploring Mastodon’s API, difficult decisions need to be made on what data is essential to be included, and why are they meaningful. By trying out existing third party mobile apps, immersing myself in its ecosystem, observing how other users are using it, I aggregate my learnings into practice, setting up tooot’s foundation structure.

### Where am I in the app

My previous experience of [cleaning up H&M’s app](/2019/hm-app-experience/) sets a clear starting point to define tooot app’s structure. The core consits of 3 needs: 1) what I can read; 2) what I can write; 3) what I have done. Bottom tab navigation is by far the best navigation approach when above purposes can be defined clearly.

In tooot, 2 tabs on the left dedicates to different timelines that a decentralized platform normally offers: my timeline, timeline on this particular server, and federated timeline. During closed and open beta period currently, there are user feedbacks suggesting to open up customization possibility of these timelines. This is yet to be discovered further after MVP.

The main tab in the center is where users can post updates. Unlike centralized platform that encourages users to post in order to retain his/her connections, observation suggests that, at least within Chinese community, willingness of posting or sharing is high when you feel you can connect to others easier without the worry of being censored.

The last 2 tabs focus on what a user has act upon, such as notifications, bookmarks, etc.

Technically, there are many “pages” that are shared between all these tabs such as the page to view a specific post. When building it, I learn a lot about that most times, it is not as simple as saying “let’s build a new page”. In order not to break above core navigation principles, retaining the scalability as well as user needs, threads need to be connected among all these considerations; or translating into a corporate setting, it is the true sharing and connecting between business, technology and design.

## Practice

Currently at open beta stage, aiming at releasing first production version in April. Bugs fixing and minor experience improvements are being focused.

Main user feedbacks during this stage suggest below 3 key points:

  1. Various browsing needs
  2. Timeline refreshing behaviour improvement
  3. Support of similar decentralized platforms

Mastodon has followed a similar approach to Twitter that offers customized listing views. Furthermore Mastodon’s API as well as its official web client offers much more freedom to define customized way of filtering a timeline, such as based on certain saved hashtags, excluding fediverse, etc. There is no motivation from my perspective to provide a “main timeline” where like Twitter that personalized feed as well as inserting advertisements, still, what kind of structure and interaction pattern that can support such highly dynamic need will be explored after version 1.0.

Stay tuned!

A passionate and experienced product designer with cross-cultural background of China 🇨🇳, the Netherlands 🇳🇱 and Sweden 🇸🇪. Constantly reaching out to experience cultural differences, and further reflecting upon the perception between human, human and machine.

Technologies advance in an effort to bridge people closer, reduce further workload. However, do people truly feel the connectedness among each other? How do I as a designer, when experiencing these rapid updates, propose what is actually beneficial for a societal transformation?

Let’s explore together! I will bring along my key competencies:

Cross-cultural design / Experience design / Design thinking / Product Development

# Marco!

## The definitive lost-in-the-couch solution... A 25-action noisemaker Siri Shortcut designed to be triggered by Hey Siri! in the event of a lost phone.

Well folks, this is my masterpiece. It is a 25-action Siri Shortcut designed for those (all-too-frequent, in my case) situations when you’ve lost track of where you last set your handset down, but you’re pretty sure it hasn’t wandered out of the house - probably not even out of the room.

In such a scenario - as long as one has Hey Siri enabled - the Shortcut will respond to “Hey Siri!!... Marco!”

The idea for this Shortcut dates back to iOS 12 Beta - when I first encountered Siri Shortcuts. For whatever reason, it didn’t take long for me to want a sort of call-and-return Shortcut for those (far too numerous) cases when I’d left my iPhone somewhere obscured in the room.

<video src="C:\Users\david\marco\MarcoBetaDemo.mp4" width=50%;></video>

### Here are the steps in full:
1. Turn Low Power Mode OFF
2. Turn Airplane Mode OFF
3. Turn Wi-Fi On
4. Turn Bluetooth On
5. Set brightness to 100%
6. Turn Do Not Disturb OFF
7. Turn appearance Light
8. Set playback destination to iPhone
9. Set volume to 89%
10. Vibrate device (Not currently working.)
11. Play **my voice** saying “Polo!” + a few other items
12. Toggle (flash) the flashlight 5 times (odd number leaving your flashlight on constantly unless it was on before the Shortcut was triggered)
13. Simultaneously (in the same repeat action) plays three separate classic Mac sounds 5 times.

# Satya Nadella’s Closing Remarks - Windows 11 Event

I’m really excited to be here with you all. Today marks a major milestone in the history of Windows. It’s the beginning of a new generation. I’m excited by what we have shown you today and how we are reimagining everything from the operating system itself to the browser to the store and the feed.

And I want to reflect briefly on how we got here. Throughout its history, Windows has been a democratizing force for the world. Windows has created entirely new categories for both consumers and businesses. It’s led to many of the world’s most successful software categories, from communications and productivity to design and business applications, each of which has created their own ecosystems. The web itself was born and grew up on Windows. It’s driven silicon innovation device innovation. It’s enabled so many people — including hobbyists, developers, and entrepreneurs — to all dream big; turn their ideas into reality; and monetize their creation.

Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators and agency for consumers.

With Windows, you can consume apps and build apps. You can play games and design games. You can buy a PC and build a PC. You can join your community and create your community. You can buy from a business and start your own business. With Windows 11, we have a renewed sense of Windows’ role in the world. As I look ahead, I see three clear opportunities.

First, Windows recognizes that there is no personal computing without personal agency. Personal computing requires choice, and we need to nurture and grow our own agency over computing itself. We want to remove the barriers that too often exist today and provide real choice and connection.

We need to be empowered to choose the applications we run, the content we consume, the people we connect to, and even how we allocate our own attention. Operating systems and devices should mold to our needs, not the other way around. That’s why we are making it easier for you to connect with the people you want, the content you want, the apps you want across all devices you want.

Second, Windows is the stage for the world’s creation. As a creator, every time you pick up a Windows device, it becomes a stage for your inspiration, so you can dream big and create something profound and lasting. Creation is going through a sea change as the balance between consumption and creation changes.

With this new generation of Windows, we are unleashing the innovation and ingenuity inherent in each of us. We want to foster these virtuous loops between content, consumption, and commerce — driven by communities for everyone. These cycles should flow freely, giving people frictionless access to apps, files, games, movies, shows, content, and communities that matter to them. We want to empower you to produce and inspire you to create. It’s why we’re introducing a complete new user experience in helping you be more productive.

And finally, Windows isn’t just an operating system; it’s a platform for platform creators. It allows for the broadest of design spaces, enabling people to build their own businesses and communities.

Today, the world needs a more open platform, one that allows apps to become platforms in their own right. Windows is a platform where things that are bigger than Windows can be born, like the web. That’s our aspiration with Windows 11, to be the platform for the next web, the next transformational software category, the next personalized content business.

A platform can only serve society if its rules allow for this foundational innovation and category creation. It’s why we’re introducing new store commerce models and policies, and creating new opportunities for local publishers, and supporting even more apps with Android apps on Windows.

This is the first version of a new era of Windows. We’re building for the next decade and beyond. And when I reflect on those chapters to come, I’m reminded of an analogy from a 19th century philosopher who compared creators to objects in our Solar System. He wrote about meteors that flash but fade away. Planets that burned longer, but whose energy is confined to their own orbit — and compared them to stars that are constant and light the path of their own.

That’s our ambition with Windows: to help other stars and entire constellations to be born and thrive. I am incredibly proud of what Windows has achieved and how it is fostered lasting opportunity for others. And I look forward to seeing what you achieve with Windows 11 and how it’ll unlock enduring opportunity for people in the world.

Thank you all very, very much.

## The definitive lost-in-the-couch solution.
(**Note**: This Shortcut is _currently in BETA_ and requires iOS 14.5 Beta 8 in order to replicate the function demonstrated above.)

**THIS VERSION INCLUDES PROFANITY**
If you’re a potential tester who would prefer a clean version, _please do contact me_ via the methods below. I appreciate your interest and want to accommodate you any way I can.

The idea for this Shortcut dates back to iOS 12 Beta - when I first encountered Siri Shortcuts. For whatever reason, it didn’t take long for me to want a sort of call-and-return Shortcut for those (far too numerous) cases when I’d left my iPhone somewhere obscured in the room.

### Marco! as it stands is a 48-action Siri Shortcut designed to be triggered by Hey Siri! in the event of a lost phone. 

In this full, original version, **you’ll hear my actual voice** at the beginning, followed by a short song sample, and then a variety of shenanigans narrated by the new Siri Voice 2.

### Here are the steps in full:
1. Turn Low Power Mode OFF
2. Turn Airplane Mode OFF
3. Turn Wi-Fi On
4. Turn Bluetooth On
5. Set brightness to 100%
6. Turn Do Not Disturb OFF
7. Turn appearance Light
8. Set playback destination to iPhone
9. Set volume to 89%
10. Vibrate device (Not currently working.)
11. Play **my voice** saying “Polo!” + a few other items
12. Toggle (flash) the flashlight 17 times (odd number leaving your flashlight on constantly unless it was on before the Shortcut was triggered)
13. Play a clip of Nasenbluten’s “[Blinded](https://bloodyfistrecords.bandcamp.com/track/blinded)”
14. **Siri Voice 2 Monologue #1** including GPS Lat/Long and Altitude (yes, I realize this isn’t particularly useful.)
15. Default notification sound plays 3 times
16. **Siri Voice 2 Monologue #2** is a theatrical reading of the infamous [Navy SEAL Copypasta](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/navy-seal-copypasta).
17. Plays a farewell in **my voice** 
18. Shows a goodbye notification
19. Plays the entirety of Sarah MacLachlan’s “[Angel](https://song.link/us/i/290584107)”

# Imagining an Operating System Entirely Devoid of Automation
[[automation]]
**noun**
==1. the act of implementing the control of equipment with advanced technology; usually involving electronic hardware==

> a world without interrupts and timeouts… legit think it would make an interesting computer science project tho.

In first-time conversation with a friend who has worked for the same ISP for 8 years...

I asked what overnights actually involve for him:

> also, the overnight stuff is just like service provisioning and network maintenance, so I wouldn't have to talk to many people

What came to my mind:

```
already highlighting my lack of knowledge… as far as I understand those two tasks… the first, especially… I guess I’m surprised that’s still something you need to have a human do.

specifically imagining if windows was unable to reasonably distribute its own network services and you had to do it yourself lol
```
> On the physical side of networking, obviously you need a person, but you'd think that on the non-physical side of things (logical side) you could just script it or it would handle its self. But in reality most networks of established service providers are fairly old and a lot of it isn't automated, and even the stuff you can automate or script often runs into unexpected errors when trying to process changes do to software or firmware versions causing conflicts. For example, there is a company called MikroTik, they make routers and switches, they pushed out a firmware update a few years back that changed the configuration syntax, which broke a lot of routers in production. Did they auto update as designed, yes - but did it result in the intended behavior by most users of the product, no

# Keyboard shortcuts on iPad? | Drafts Community Thread

* [Keyboard shortcuts on iPad? - General Discussion - Drafts Community](https://forums.getdrafts.com/t/keyboard-shortcuts-on-ipad/10389/3)

## Original
Hi all —

I just randomly (and happily) discovered that I can navigate between drafts on the iPad Pro keyboard using command-option-up/down. I’d love to use shortcuts like this to process my list of drafts, at least to archive or delete them. However I can’t find anywhere in the docs where keyboard shortcuts are listed (maybe due to poor searching skills). Is there such a list somewhere I can learn from?

Thanks,
Ramon

Hold down the CMD key in any app and you should get an overlay of keyboard shortcuts.

This is definitely *the* place to start, but Drafts is incredibly unique on iOS in that you can pretty much customize keyboard shortcuts entirely, by way of custom shortcuts *per Action*.

The best way to illustrate this might be to simply share my current list of keyboard shortcuts, which I’ve also published in a [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/extratone/2e54243a2123ccfa6a37c6e8cc1057e2).

The majority of these are Actions I downloaded via the [Action Directory](https://actions.getdrafts.com/) and manually set/altered their respective keyboard shortcut as per [this documentation](https://docs.getdrafts.com/docs/actions/editing-actions).


@Felciano I would be more than happy to speak directly about this if you need further help - my big life project right now literally involves documenting Bluetooth keyboard support on iPhone, so it’s pretty darn fresh in my mind.

### @sylumer

@Blue, I would recommend that you don’t add shortcuts to the TAD-* actions directly. When you update the action groups (I try and release at least one update every month), the shortcuts would be wiped out (unless something has changed with the action group updating process). None of the TAD-* actions have keyboard shortcuts set. The recommendation is instead to create your own actions with the icon, name and keyboard shortcut of your choice, and then have a single action step to include the TAD-* action. This effectively gives you a customised alias to the underlying action.

You may also be interested in the TAD-Export Action Shortcut Keys/TAD-List Action Shortcuts. They output the action names along with their keyboard shortcuts for actions with keyboard shortcuts. The exports are just in slightly different formats, and honestly, I’m not sure why they are in different groups or why I ended up with the two formats. I suspect I’ll revisit that in an upcoming update.

[/quote]

To be honest, I had been fiddling with them so much, my plan was to just reconfigure them one-by-one if/when I ended up clearing them with an update but this solution is far too smart to ignore lol. Thank you!

[quote="sylumer, post:4, topic:10389"]
You may also be interested in the `TAD-Export Action Shortcut Keys`/`TAD-List Action Shortcuts`.
[/quote]

The list you see above was exported with the latter (`TAD-List Action Shortcuts,`) which lists the name of the action first, then the command.  `TAD-Export Action Shortcut Keys` is identical as far as can tell except it lists the commands first, then the action. I thought there was a third one which pasted the list into the current Draft instead of creating a new one, but I can’t seem to find it now. Could’ve been dreaming lol.

Sorta petty I suppose but I finally finished this process - precisely 31 days later lol - and wow! Definitely an illuminating/educational experience. So much so , in fact, that I would absolutely recommend anyone wanting a better familiarity with how Actions work do what I did - create an Action Group just to collect your favorite TAD actions you’ve come across. Even if keyboard shortcuts aren’t involved.

(In case you were wondering, my favorite Action at the moment is [**Load Most Changed Draft**](https://www.thoughtasylum.com/taagd/#tad-load-most-changed-draft) lol.)

![Custom Text Image Example](https://i.snap.as/bpe2Lm8H.jpeg)
![Toolbox Pro Icon](https://i.snap.as/OcIcYbO1.png) 
## About
This Shortcut uses [Toolbox Pro](https://toolboxpro.app)’s “Create image from text” action to create a JPEG image with a custom single-color background (specified in hex) and single-color text (also specified in hex) of your choosing atop it. It then passes said image to Quick Look. **That’s it** - you’ll need to use the Share Sheet from there in order to actually save the image file.

In `Version 2021.4` of the Toolbox Pro app (released today, 5-30-2021,) the capabilities of the “Create image from text” action were expanded to allow for larger images. I use 3000x2000 in the interest of standardization, personally, and have so far seen great results.

### Considerations 
**Here’s what you’ll need to know:**
- lineBreak: (The example images uses `Wrap Word`)
- font:
- textColour:
- backgroundColour:
- width:
- alignment:
- text:
- height:
- fontSize:

# Why I Didn't Follow You Back

![Twitter Follow Limits](https://i.snap.as/hKqfPWNd.png)

## Twitter's follow limit, the real consequences of "The Ratio," and my social media methodology.

**There is a limit to how many accounts you can follow on Twitter**. It was finally documented in this [official help document](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit), dated March 2019, but for more than ten years, it was implemented without any explanation from the service, and was known only to those of us who'd actually encountered it.

Here's what happens when I try to follow a new account from [@NeoYokel](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel):

https://imgur.com/gallery/GcpLylS

I was only able to verify that this has been the case since October 20th, 2017 - naturally, I didn't bother to note  the actual date I first received that notice.

**If you're a recent follower of mine and you've found this document**, please know that I have seen your expressed desire to keep in touch in some way (which is what following someone "says," I think we can agree,) and have probably responded by adding you to one of my [Twitter Lists](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/lists). You may have received a notification about this, but if you haven't, it's because I have not yet chosen to make the List to which I added you public. 

I also want you to know that I am available to speak directly about this if you have questions - whether that be on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), by [email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com), or [otherwise](https://davidblue.wtf). Here's my personal phone number: +1 (573) 823-4380

For whatever it's worth, *thanks for the follow*. I hope to hear from you but if I don't, thanks okay, too.

`https://gist.github.com/extratone/8b762de50de414f8a4be05f9b0407fd8`

***

A big theme in my 20s has been coming (slowly) to terms with the fact that I built my entire adult social life around a single, centralized social media Web Site. I mentioned this in [my Tweetbot 6 review](https://bilge.world/tweetbot-6-ios-review), recently, but - as I also strive to be a more sincere person and spend more time adding value to _others_’ lives - I’ve concluded that it is the time now to speak as openly and vulnerably as I can about my “Social Media Methodology.” Most of the resulting insights will not be new information, but I continue to encounter greater and greater confusion in the face of my well-meaning behavior online and I have decided to stop disregarding it. 

This is _not_ an essay about how to “optimize” your social media use. If anything, it is a sort of manifesto against the very idea of designed online behavior beyond simply **being considerate** in a sense that predates even the spoken word. I, myself, have occupied a position well on the _chaotic_ side of the spectrum. You could say I have been mostly _chaotic neutral_ throughout my 12 years on Twitter thus far, and am actively working toward (and advocating for) _chaotic good_.

## Assumptions at bat
1. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will *ever* result in a substantial accumulation of money/"influence" (which seems to be the diluted zag of "POWER" of the moment.) Those interested in learning about "marketing" should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to *start* with Twitter - this I can say with certainty. 
2. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user's choices/methodology to produce results which we *have*, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was *not* created as a *game to be won*. Perhaps more importantly, the "prize" of "winning" in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, "influence," relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.
3. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with _both_ strangers and friends in a manner which generally **adds value to the lives of all involved**.
4. 3 is not only _possible_ - it is easily _reproducible_. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples. 
5. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, **neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media**.

# Discourse Post to Raw Markdown

The native URL to the thread:
`https://meta.discourse.org/t/export-topic-as-markdown-enabled-for-all-participants/152185`

By eliminating the topic title from a given post’s URL (`t/export-topic-as-markdown-enabled-for-all-participants`) and prepending `raw/`, we’re left only with the post ID (`152185`).

The [whole URL](https://meta.discourse.org/raw/152185) will take one to the plain text of the post with Markdown formatting.
`https://meta.discourse.org/raw/152185`

As [one of the replies to that thread](https://meta.discourse.org/t/export-topic-as-markdown-enabled-for-all-participants/152185/3) notes, this unfortunately has to be done post-by-post by appending the post’s order number.

# Scribam Quid None Legerim

[A Brief, Unedited Reflection on the History of my Failed Media Projects - The Psalms](https://davidblue.substack.com/p/inmunis-extratone-history-david-blue)
Are y'all talking about embedding image *files* within an email? As far as I understand email, technically, that sounds like it would be a nightmare. 

If I may, as someone who uses my phone to compose/edit/publish as often as I use my desktop, I'd ask you to reevaluate the snap.as workflow just one more time...

![Gemini](https://i.snap.as/wenaR8yS.png)

To be honest, I thought the separation of the image service was really strange and janky when I first started using Write.as but I absolutely LOVE it now. It has made me so much more efficient, *especially* on mobile.

## This is an excerpt with commentary from a guest presentation during the iPad Pro unveiling at Apple's Fall 2015 special event.

It was, indeed, a relatively important one, as arguably the definitive moment leading to the relationship between Apple, Inc. and Microsoft constructing the context that makes first watch so crass.

## ‽‽‽

*The Psalms* (alternatively/interchangeably entitled *Bilge*) is a monobyline World Wide Web Blog written by David Blue (good morning!) observing and selectively amplifying the characters, organizations, and stories surrounding the most abrupt, profound, and spectacular communicative renaissance in the history of the human species. 

Less abstractly, its beat is **wholly digital**, namely in **tools** (software, services, and methodologies) and **culture** (music, film, podcasts, and media) from a distinct lens established at good distance from California.

It is [unlicensed](https://gist.github.com/extratone/140a11428b5dd1dda500b3928e0438b1) and entirely [written in public](https://tomcritchlow.com/2020/07/23/thinking-in-public/) largely via [**this GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/extratone/bilge), supplemented by experiments on a variety of [other platforms](https://www.notion.so/rotund/9fdc8e9610b34b8f991ebc148b760055?v=c170b58650c04fbdb7adc551a73d16a7), including (arguably) [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel).

For better or worse, my voice as represented in _The Psalms_ has continued to be saturated with self-referential and occasionally self-disparaging/deprecating qualification. If I am indeed an authority on myself, I would suggest that these are essential tools rather than crutches, and note that I have made some progress in excusing myself for them out of the (perhaps cliché) realization that “life” - and especially _truth_ - can be infinitely complicated, and therefore worthwhile thought on just about anything is inevitably going to be (sometimes aggravatingly) tedious in its complexity.

**I am not a paid journalist** and **I don’t break stories**. That’s not to say that I wouldn’t if an opportunity happened upon me, but it is not where I’m at my best.

On that note, perhaps the single defining issue I’m contending with in life, right now, is the suddenly slight reframing of how I understood my most fundamental drivers 

### What does *The Psalms* cover?

Primarily, this blog exists to amplify [undercovered](http://bit.ly/undercovered) developers, musicians, writers, curators, and media professionals, most often through the process of **analyzing their work**. 

Some recent examples include [my interview with Brad Varol](https://anchor.fm/davidblue/episodes/Brad-Varol--Father-of-Whyp-es12ge), who’s creating a handy web tool for sharing audio (replacing Clyp) and [my guide to music apps on iPhone](https://bilge.world/iphone-ios-music-apps).

Two more _significant_ examples: [my interview with Mastodon creator Eugen Rochko](https://bilge.world/eugen-rochko-interview) and [my huge case for Bandcamp](https://bilge.world/bandcamp-streaming-music) as the streaming service we’ve all been asking for.



### How do you see the world?

Anyone _truly_ curious about the answer to this question, for whatever reason, should read my very-autobiographical essay “[Why I Write About Technology](https://bilge.world/why)” from 2018, though my perspective has changed quite significantly in the time, since. 

I’m going to take further queue from Casey Newton’s about page format and list a few important assumptions of mine about consumer technology in bullet point form:
* The delivery of technology media to the mainstream has lessened its ability to truly write critically about the big tech companies it now shares office buildings with.
* The Open Source/Open Web community continues to struggle with their _brand image_ (if you will) in both old and new ways that needlessly alienate (and sometimes obfuscate) some of their most important contributions from the average user. Technology media has failed in their responsibility to address this issue.
* Women have had a more than equal share in building the digital age and have yet to be recognized for it. 
* Black people have important contributions of all sorts to technology that have yet to be recognized.
* The software development community is a source of insights in many aspects of life _other than technology_. It is also often hopelessly blind to others. 
* Technology media has failed to discuss consumer technology’s presence in the lives of working class people, to their own detriment.
* The narrative surrounding consumer technology has been allowed by technology media to shift from products toward organizations and figureheads, perhaps inevitably. 
* The power dynamics found in the stories of Software History have thus far been underutilized in technology media’s critical eye on the same elements in today’s narratives.

I'm David Blue and **I am not a software developer**. Though I do fairly regularly author and distribute various tool-adjacent configurations you may find of value, I am fundamentally *not a builder*, though I am relentlessly compelled to seek out spaces like GitHub where builders congregate around the context of work

Here are some ideas of what you can tell your potential sponsors:

- [ ] Why is their sponsorship important? How will you use the funds?

# Sidechannel's Server Rules
{>>No, I didn’t create this draft unintentiomally<<}
1. Sidechannel is a place to discuss current events and culture in a friendly, collegial way. We invite you to be smart, kind, welcoming, funny, charming, incisive, prescient, skeptical: whoever you are on your best day.
2. Sidechannel is reserved for people who are currently paying for at least one of the newsletters it was created to support. If you grabbed an invitation link from someone else, or your paid subscription lapses, we reserve the right to remove you from the server — though we’ll give you a chance to subscribe first!
3. Share news, opinions, personal experiences, charts, data, photos, tweets, and other media. Do not share misinformation, disinformation, or spam — including in DMs to other members.
4. Do not promote your own hustles — or your clients’ hustles — except for in designated channels.
5. Stay on topic. Good conversations meander, but keep truly off-topic posting to the lounge.(edited)
[11:27 AM]
6. Discuss subjects in good faith. Do not troll, mock, or harass other members of the community.
7. Pseudonyms are welcome, and you do not have to disclose where you work. But do not impersonate anyone.
8. Keep it safe for work. Sidechannel is not the place for disturbing images, racy pictures, or anything else you wouldn’t want to share with your entire company.
9. Be inclusive of all people and points of view. This is particularly true for Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and people in the LBGTQ+ community. We will remove any homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, or racist content without discussion.
10. If someone is bothering you or you would like to report a post or member who you believe is violating these rules, please contact one of the co-hosts. If the channel is managed by a particular host, start with them.
11. Final moderation decisions are subject to the whims of the newsletter writers.
12. We expect to update these rules as necessary. When we do, we’ll tell you in the announcements channel.
13. Follow the spirit of these rules as well as the letter of them. Do not become an edgelord. We err on the side of removing borderline content — and borderline users — from the server.

## About
This Shortcut retrieves the Song.Link/Odesli page URL for the track currently playing, copies said URL to the clipboard, and opens the URL in Safari. 

I have it titled “SL” so - if I feel like sharing the current track - all I need to do is type “sl” to Siri and its Song.Link page opens in Safari (mainly to make sure it’s the proper page.)

# Version 1.2
2021-04-28-02.47.38
I removed the copy to clipboard action from the Shortcut and updated it accordingly on RoutineHub today - it turns out, it was just copying the entire URL from whatever streaming service `eg: song.link/youtube.com/thelink instead of song.link.com/correctlink` which needlessly adds to the already-overwhelming number of API requests they’re experiencing right now. Instead, just tap the small “copy link” text (first of three buttons, by default.)

# Marco! Shortcut Documentation
## The definitive lost-in-the-couch solution.

`https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/3ccffd56ee63460f859be591df739fb9`

So the idea behind this shortcut:

You've lost your phone under the couch cushions somewhere and you use Hey Siri by saying "Hey Siri! Marco!" and the shortcut responds with my actual voice (in this version) saying "Polo bitch!", and then followed by 

1. Flashlight flashing
2. A brief sound clip (via base64 decoding like my voice)
3. Siri blabbing in various different ways.

The challenge for me has been determining what will work when the phone is locked. The last version I tested on Beta 5 worked 100%, but on Beta 6.... it just won't give consistent results so.

If you could just lock your phone, use "hey siri test marco" to trigger the shortcut and then tell me how far it gets, it would help tremendously. Even just one or two attempts._

# Another Update on Writas Emails

[The original thread](https://discuss.write.as/t/word-character-count-limit-for-letters/1604/2)

_Another update_: 

I think I realized the problem. Part of my Writeas workflow has always involved using **scheduled posts** as a method of previewing how a post is going to look on the site as I’m composing. In the past (namely, in the post I was referring to originally in this thread and others,) I had used the same post as the final, published one, by changing the date from some point in the distant future to the current time.

It didn’t occur to me until just recently that this could be very confusing for the site’s backend, so I’ve been making an effort to **create a new post at the point I’m ready to publish** and deleting the scheduled draft. Since, I’ve had absolutely zero issues with new posts arriving in my inbox. 

I thought I’d update this thread just in case anyone was doing something similar.

## About
I figured I may as well share my personal Drafts web page capture Shortcut, which reliably returns Markdown-formatted Drafts headed by a given web page’s featured image (if present,) byline, and timestamp, followed by a correctly-hyperlinked source URL between quotation marks.

# Use Magic Keyboard with iPhone | iPhone User Guide 
You can use Magic Keyboard, including Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, to enter text on iPhone. Magic Keyboard connects to iPhone using Bluetooth and is powered by a built-in rechargeable battery. (Magic Keyboard is sold separately.)

_Note_: For compatibility information about Apple Wireless Keyboard and third-party Bluetooth keyboards, see the Apple Support article [Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Keyboard compatibility with iOS devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202041).

***
### Pair Magic Keyboard to iPhone
1. Make sure the keyboard is turned on and charged.
2. On iPhone, go to Settings ⚙︎ > Bluetooth, then turn on Bluetooth.
3. Select the device when it appears in the Other Devices ßlist.

_Note_: If Magic Keyboard is already paired with another device, you must unpair them before you can connect Magic Keyboard to your iPhone. For iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, see [Unpair a Bluetooth device](ibooks://1515995528/iph6e757db44.xhtml#iph8f62615e0). On Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences > Bluetooth, select the device, then Control-click its name.
***

### Reconnect Magic Keyboard to iPhone
Magic Keyboard disconnects when you turn its switch to Off or when you move it or iPhone out of Bluetooth range—about 33 feet (10 meters).

To reconnect, turn the keyboard switch to On, or bring the keyboard and iPhone back into range, then tap any key.

When Magic Keyboard is reconnected, the onscreen keyboard doesn’t appear.

***
### Switch to the onscreen keyboard
You need to use the onscreen keyboard instead of an external keyboard to do things like type accented characters or use dictation.

To show the onscreen keyboard, press ⏏︎ on the external keyboard. To hide the onscreen keyboard, press ⏏︎ again.

***
### Switch between language and emoji keyboards
1. On Magic Keyboard, press and hold the Control key.
2. Press the Space bar to cycle between English, emoji, and [any keyboards you added for typing in different languages](ibooks://1515995528/iph3c511601.xhtml#iph73b71eb).

***
### Open Search using Magic Keyboard
Press Command-Space.

***
### Change typing options for Magic Keyboard
You can change how iPhone automatically responds to your typing on an external keyboard.

Go to Settings ⚙︎ > General > Keyboard > Hardware Keyboard, then do any of the following:

* _Assign an alternative keyboard layout_: Tap a language at the top of the screen, then choose an alternative layout from the list. (An alternative keyboard layout that doesn’t match the keys on your external keyboard.)
* _Turn Auto-Capitalization on or off_: When this option is selected, an app supporting this feature capitalizes proper nouns and the first words in sentences as you type.
* _Turn Auto-Correction on or off_: When this option is selected, an app supporting this feature corrects the spelling as you type.
* _Turn “.” Shortcut on or off_: When this option is selected, double-tapping the space bar inserts a period followed by a space.
* _Change the action performed by the Command key or other modifier key_: Tap Modifier Keys, tap a key, then choose the action you want it to perform.

## About
This Shortcut was originally inspired by [@mralexhay‘s original](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2343/) - which notably did not require Toolbox Pro, but is no longer functioning correctly.

It captures the show notes in HTML from the currently-playing episode in Overcast, converts the HTML to Rich Text, converts said Rich Text to Markdown, and stashes the result in a new Draft.

# Most Intriguing Apps

Updated to 

## An ongoing list of links to iOS apps, App Stories, and greater media coverage.

I’ve privately maintained a list like this for as long as I can remember, to be honest, but it’s never been particularly useful to others until now. Though it’ll probably never be alphabatized, standardized, or comprehensively annotated, it *will* be kept relatively up-to-date - certainly for the duration of my iPhone 12 Pro Max long review.

# Drafts Forum Reply Regarding “Run Action with Text” Action
[quote="agiletortoise, post:10, topic:7319"]
There are many ways to get a result back to Shortcuts. The Drafts action could put text in the cllpboard, as @sylumer mentioned, but also write to files, or store results in a draft which could be fetched. Lots of options.
[/quote]

(Hopefully I’m reviving this thread in a way that might prove useful to others.)

I understand that the task the OP was hoping to accomplish can be done without Drafts, but regarding this quote about the “Run Action with Text” Shortcuts action, I’d just ask: *how*?

As in, how exactly would I go about getting the action’s output into the clipboard/a file/a fetchable draft/etc?

Apologies if I’m missing something here… and thank you!

Do you have a point A and point B in mind? It’s often a lot easier to suggest the right approach with a specific goal.

For the clipboard? There is the “clipboard” action step that can place text in the clipboard, but also clipboard scripting methods.

For Files? Similar. There are “File” action steps that can write text to files, but also ways to script writing files.

Etc

***

Specifically, I was hoping to add a function to my “[Collect References](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/8913/)” Shortcut (which outputs all hyperlinks from a given article/webpage as a list of raw URLs) which grabs titles for each respective URL and formats them as proper Markdown links ([title](url)) using this “[Replace URLS by MD Links](https://actions.getdrafts.com/a/1be)” Drafts action from the action directory.

As per the screenshot below, I suppose I’m looking for the correct action in place of “Copy to Clipboard” which handles the result of said Drafts action, if possible.

## About

[**Quick Video Demo**](https://youtube.com/shorts/HsHxynuZ6ZY) (YouTube)

I built this shortcut to aid in my own reading/research by collecting all of the hyperlinks from a given article/webpage and stashing them in a Bear note entitled “[Title of Article]” References. By default, it is also configured to add all of the URLs to one’s Safari Reading List, which can quickly turn into a mess, notably.

It *does* require the Toolbox Pro app for its URL extraction, but if you happen to really need a shortcut with a similar function and *do not* want to spend money on Toolbox Pro, please contact me via the methods below. (Seriously)

# Why I have continued to host audio content on Spotify properties
If you've followed my work at all in the past three years, I thought the potential appearance of _actual_ open.spotify embeds on _The Psalms_, going forward might prompt some questions. More importantly, though, are the potentials provided in the current configuration of the company's web-facing publishing assets for those artists they have had the most detrimental effect on.

**Anchor.fm and the Anchor mobile apps**, namely, are the first means for individual creators to publish content on the Spotify service, apparently minus even the most basic editorial intervention.

# Apple and Streaming Music in 2021 (Notes)
> Why is Apple implementing ATT? I believe Apple has four motivations in instituting this privacy policy:

* to benefit its own ad network, which doesn’t track users in the very specific way that Apple has defined for ATT compliance;
* to juxtapose iOS favorably with Android and drive device sales;
* to specifically hurt Facebook, which has tested the boundaries of Apple’s iOS ~ for years;
*  and to regain editorial control of iOS from ad networks and influence how people use their iPhones. 

This last motivation is the most poignant: Apple has lost ::distribution relevance:: on iOS, with ads becoming the primary point of first contact most users have with new apps on their phones. Ads drive discovery on iOS: ::The App Store is merely a mobile checkout lane::. Apple is using ATT as a means of crippling performance advertising—making it harder to target app ads to specific users’ interests—and driving content discovery back to the App Store.

title: UIKeyCommand
author: Nate Cook
category: Cocoa
excerpt: "As part of the push for greater productivity on the iPad, iOS 9 adds *Discoverability*, an overlay showing the currently available key commands inside an app. This small change suddenly makes key commands far more viable on the iPad and, with it, makes `UIKeyCommand` a necessary addition to your app."
status:
    swift: 2.0
---

Adding a new feature to a product is always a tradeoff. Will the added utility of a new feature be enough to offset the added complexity? Shortcuts would seem to side-step this issue—after all, they're simply a quicker alternative for features already in your app. But that creates another dilemma: what if a new feature is added and no one knows it's there?

When key commands for external keyboards debuted in iOS 7, there was no intrinsic way to learn of their existence. Unlike in OS X, where a user can gradually discover shortcuts for the menu items they use most often, an iOS app had few ways to communicate what key commands are available. Initial tours flash by and fade from memory; help screens are hidden out of sight. Without a way to make shortcuts visible in a timely and relevant manner, users were sure to miss out on useful features that developers had taken the time to implement.

No longer. As part of the push for greater productivity on the iPad, iOS 9 adds *Discoverability*, an overlay showing the currently available key commands inside an app. This small change suddenly makes key commands far more viable on the iPad and, with it, makes `UIKeyCommand` a necessary addition to your app.

---

## `UIKeyCommand`

The `UIKeyCommand` class is in fact quite simple, with only four properties to configure:

- `input`: The character of the key you'd like to recognize, or the correct constant for the arrow and escape keys, which do not have characters themselves. The available constants are:
    - `UIKeyInputUpArrow`
    - `UIKeyInputDownArrow`
    - `UIKeyInputLeftArrow`
    - `UIKeyInputRightArrow`
    - `UIKeyInputEscape`

- `modifierFlags`: One or more `UIKeyModifierFlags`, describing the modifier keys that should be pressed in combination with `input`:
    - `.Command`, `.Alternate`, `.Shift`, `.Control`: The Command, Option, Shift, and Control keys, respectively.
    - `.NumericPad`: Indicates that `input` should come from the numeric keypad rather than the top row of the standard keyboard.
    - `.AlphaShift`: Indicates that the CapsLock key should be *pressed* as part of the combination, rather than just engaged.

- `action`: The selector to call when the key command is invoked, called with a `UIKeyCommand` as its only argument. The key event will travel up the responder chain until a matching selector is found.

- `discoverabilityTitle` *(iOS 9 only)*: An optional label to display for the key command in the Discoverability layover. Only key commands with a title set will be listed.




## Responding to Key Commands

Enabling key commands is as simple as providing an array of `UIKeyCommand` instances somewhere in the responder chain. Text inputs are automatically first responders, but perhaps more usefully, a view controller can respond to key commands by implementing `canBecomeFirstResponder()`:

```swift
override func canBecomeFirstResponder() -> Bool {
    return true
}
```
```objc
- (BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder {
    return YES;
}
```

Next, provide a list of available key commands via the `keyCommands` property:

```swift
override var keyCommands: [UIKeyCommand]? {
    return [
        UIKeyCommand(input: "1", modifierFlags: .Command, action: "selectTab:", discoverabilityTitle: "Types"),
        UIKeyCommand(input: "2", modifierFlags: .Command, action: "selectTab:", discoverabilityTitle: "Protocols"),
        UIKeyCommand(input: "3", modifierFlags: .Command, action: "selectTab:", discoverabilityTitle: "Functions"),
        UIKeyCommand(input: "4", modifierFlags: .Command, action: "selectTab:", discoverabilityTitle: "Operators"),
            
        UIKeyCommand(input: "f", modifierFlags: [.Command, .Alternate], action: "search:", discoverabilityTitle: "Find…"),
    ]
}

<#...#>

func selectTab(sender: UIKeyCommand) {
    let selectedTab = sender.input
    <#...#>
}
```
```objc
- (NSArray<UIKeyCommand *>*)keyCommands {
    return @[
        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"1" modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand action:@selector(selectTab:) discoverabilityTitle:@"Types"],
        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"2" modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand action:@selector(selectTab:) discoverabilityTitle:@"Protocols"],
        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"3" modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand action:@selector(selectTab:) discoverabilityTitle:@"Functions"],
        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"4" modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand action:@selector(selectTab:) discoverabilityTitle:@"Operators"],

        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"f" 
                            modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand | UIKeyModifierAlternate 
                                   action:@selector(search:) 
                     discoverabilityTitle:@"Find…"]
    ];
}

<#...#>

- (void)selectTab:(UIKeyCommand *)sender {
    NSString *selectedTab = sender.input;
    <#...#>
}
```

In the Discoverability layover, accessed by holding down the Command key, key commands are listed in the order you specified:

![Discoverability Layover]({% asset uikeycommand-discoverability.png @path %})

*Voila!* Secrets, revealed!


### Context Sensitivity

The `keyCommands` property is accessed whenever a key pressed, making it possible to provide context-sensitive responses depending on the state of your application. While this is similar to the way a menu item and its active/inactive state are configured in OS X, the recommendation for iOS is to omit inactive commands completely—that is, there are no grayed out commands in the Discoverability layover.

Here, a set of commands that are available to logged in users of an app are included only when appropriate:

```swift
let globalKeyCommands = [UIKeyCommand(input:...), ...]
let loggedInUserKeyCommands = [UIKeyCommand(input:...), ...]

override var keyCommands: [UIKeyCommand]? {
    if isLoggedInUser() {
        return globalKeyCommands + loggedInUserKeyCommands
    } else {
        return globalKeyCommands
    }
}
```

Although we don't take shortcuts when creating our apps, that doesn't mean our users won't find shortcuts useful. Adding key commands lets control of your app shift from the screen to the keyboard—your users will love the option.

# Comparison of syntax extensions in Markdown flavors 

I created a crude comparison of the syntax of the various common Markdown extensions to have a better view on what are the most common extensions and what is the most widely accepted syntax for them. The list of Markdown flavors that I looked at was based on the list found on CommonMark's [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark/wiki/markdown-flavors).

`[*]`: Some dialects use the [CriticMarkup] syntax for these features
`[**]`: Planned in the future

# Extramark

The aim of ExtraMark is to create a **well-defined** flavor of Markdown that is a **clear superset of [CommonMark](https://github.com/commonmark/commonmark)** as it is becoming more and more accepted as the de-facto standard for basic Markdown syntax. This project includes the most common syntax extensions for Markdown to have a flavor that could be used by a wide variety of projects and applications.
In order to achieve this I created this comparison. Below is the reasoning for the syntax choices for Extramark.

## Syntax extensions

### Superscript

The ability to create superscript text seems to be a common feature among the various flavors. With the execption of Redcarpet, all implementations support the `^...^` syntax. Some support the variant where the closing `^` is missing, but to keep the snytax unambiguous the closing `^` is required.

```md
The cube's surface area is 36 cm^3^.
```

### Subscript

Just as superscript, subscript is a popular syntax extension. All of the above flavors that support it has the same syntax.

```md
Tap water mainly consists of H~2~O but it has many other components as well.
```

### Strikethrough

The stikethrough syntax extension was popularized by GFM and has two syntaxes across implementations. Some variants use the `~~...~~` syntax while dialects use the syntax from CriticMarkup. Some use both. 
Using CriticMarkup seems the right choice here as it is a somewhat standarized specification for edits in text. *Adding support to the GFM style strikethroughs could increase cross compatibility with many dialects.*

```md
Markdown is a does ~~not~~ support strikethroughs.
```

### Insertion

All implementations use some form of the `+` symbol to denote insertion. Using the CriticMarkup syntax here seems reasonable as it provides specification to all text edit options.

```md
Markdown supports bold, italic{++ and insertions++}.
```

### Highlight

As with strikethrough and insertion CriticMarkup also provides solution to this syntax extension. *The `==...==` syntax is also widely used so adding support for this could increase compatibilty.*

```md
Markdown syntax {==is extended==} by many syntax extensions.
```

### Footnotes

There seems to be a concensus on how to denote footnotes in Markdown. The only difference is that while some dialects only allow numbers as the footnote indicator, others allow any text. The latter is the more universal solution.

> This syntax extension is not yet part of ExtraMark!

```md
This page is written with Markdown[^1].

[^1]: Or at least some dialect of it.
```
### Task lists

Any implementation that uses task lists uses the snytax of GFM.

> This syntax extension is not yet part of ExtraMark!

```md
# Todo

- [X] Add CriticMarkup support
- [ ] Add task list support
- [ ] Add Footnotes support
```

### Tables

Tables are one of the most common feature among Markdown dialects and most use the GFM style tables (some with additions). Using the GFM style seems to be the right path.

### Abbreviation

Abbreviations are also a popular feature in Markdown dialects. There is a universal concensus on the syntax.

> This syntax extension is not yet part of ExtraMark!

```md
*[MD]: Markdown
MD is a lightweight markup language for creating documents.
```

### Definition lists

Another common syntax extension is the definition list. The syntax is the same for all dialects.

```md
Markdown
: A lightweight markup language for creating documents.
```

### Smart typo

Some Markdown dialects support transforming common symbols into single characters (e.g. `(c) or (tm)`). While not a feature that many dialects support it is a pain-free quality of life improvement for writing Markdown documents.

```md
A copyright symbol: (c)
```

### Table of contents

Generating a table of contents with a single "Markdown tag" can help you save a lot of time, but the single-tag TOC doesn't show the content that actually gets generated.
For that I believe a single-tag TOC is an antipattern in Markdown. There are wonderful tools for text editors that can generate a table of contents for any Markdown document with a press of a button.
Generating the TOC as a simple nested Markdown list helps maintaining readability and does not violate the original Markdown philosophy: *"A Markdown formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text..."*.

### Math

Math for Markdown is a hard question. There are many implementations and most of them use their own syntax. The two most common syntax elements are using the `$` and `$$` as delimiters for inline and block math and using LaTeX's `\\(...\\)` and `\\[...\\]` delimiters.
As it is already commonplace to use LaTeX for the actual math markup it seems logical to use LaTeX's delimiters but they are very long and hard to read. And the original Markdown philosophy says: *"Readability, however, is emphasized above all else."*. That is an argument for using the `$` sign delimiter.
There are some hard arguments for and against both methods on the CommonMark forum.

### Mermaid

Some Markdown dialects allow the creation of diagrams using Mermaid syntax. This seems to contradict the original idea of Markdown documents as these generate some images that should be separate content. For the time being I don't see any good reasons to include Mermaid.

> This syntax extension is not part of ExtraMark!

## Conclusion

Based on these results I created the ExtraMark flavor of Markdown. It ended up being very similar to MultiMarkdown but MultiMarkdown is not based on CommonMark and doesn't have a universal JavaScript implementation.

okay so you know this is all I've been doing for months, now, so I've read tens of thousands of words on the iPhone 12 lineup and the 12 Mini, specifically, as the notable universal favorite among the tech media… I had heard about how pleasant it was to hold… how I *really just had to hold it* to ever truly understand what everyone has been going on about. 

thanks to my friend, I finally got the chance!

and despite it being rammed into my head, I *still* actually *felt something* just handling the little thing… 

THIS IS THE ONE. this is the recommendation: the 12 Mini is special and probably won't happen again.

## About
This shortcut is literally just a duplicate of Michael Bierman’s “Clean Apple News Links” shortcut.

I’ve just removed everything after the URL is returned and instead added the “Open URLs” action. Swap it out with "Open URL in... [your browser of choice]" if you'd like.

It works!

# Release Notes
1.1 - March 30, 2021, 7:10 p.m.
Version 1.1 

I’ve changed the title of the shortcut and this metadata.

To be honest, I had to duplicate Bierman’s shortcut again, though I believe I understood better what the shortcut was doing. All I know is that 1.0 was only returning the parent directory of a given cleaned Apple News link, but this one should return the right one without any remaining unnecessary stuff. :)

I also realized I forgot to actually specify that I asked Bierman first, who gave his express permission for both versioning and publishing:

“ **NOTE: This Shortcut was created and published with explicit permission from the original Shortcut’s creator.**”

# Periscope Preservation
## An ongoing document for (former) Periscope users detailing all available means of preserving/scraping data and media from psp.tv.

The [official announcement of Periscope's demise](https://periscope.medium.com/farewell-periscope-164db2742b7c) was posted on their Medium blog on December 15th, 2020.

It states:
> Broadcasts that were shared to Twitter will live on as replays, and all broadcasters will be able to download an archive of their Periscope broadcasts and data before the app is removed in March 2021.

Thanks to [a brief series of Tweets](https://twitter.com/twittersupport/status/1367173142188335114) from @TwitterSupport, we know **the app is going to be removed from the app store on March 31st**. (Which is in 8 days, atm.)

_However_, the hyperlink referenced for users to find "more info… about what will happen to your Super Hearts and broadcasts, how you can go live on Twitter going forward, and more" (https://help.twitter.com/using-twitter/periscope-faq) is **currently broken** as of Mar 24, 2021 at 08:20 (CST.) I have posted replies on both [Medium](https://extratone.medium.com/periscope-twitter-public-policy-5305341a9043) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1374680479874568194) pinging the relevant accounts I could find.

Given the above pullquote from the blog post, this means Twitter/Periscope has 8 days to enable users to download "an archive of their Periscope broadcasts and data," but…

## The method for downloading "broadcasts and data" as documented by Twitter/Periscope does not currently work
* [Youtube-dl](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/) supports downloading Periscope broadcasts and is by far the best method I have discovered. (It even saves them as a .mp4 file with 0 configuration, at the moment.)
* [Scopedown](https://downloadperiscopevideos.com) is another, tried-and-true method of scraping full Periscope broadcasts in their native format, but will eventually obstruct you with a paywall.
* The page all current Periscope documentation eventually points you to (https://www.pscp.tv/account/your-data) in order to "download your data" **currently results only in a virtually useless .JSON file** (it only includes broadcast IDs and some bewildering timestamp-related data.)

Any/all thoughts/feedback/corrections/updates would be deeply appreciated here on Github, [by email](mailto:davidblue@extratone.com), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel), or [any other social platform](https://www.notion.so/rotund/Social-Directory-aea1bee51a64461b91bf4de241a4a16d).
wireless charging update:
"Wireless Charging" is actually "inductive charging," and represents a case where branding a technical process just causes confusion. I know what magnetic induction is!… https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductive_charging

I have spent the past few days charging my phone exclusively with this Tylt device, which has been a pretty great stand for my phone while using my keyboard - better than my jank-ass tripod setup, anyway. https://www.tylt.com/product/crest

unfortunately, maintaining a reliable connection has been a problem. sometimes, the phone won't stop disconnecting and reconnecting constantly while the LED on the charger, itself, blinks.

as per internet advice, I've plugged the power supply directly into the wall, now (I use extension cords all the time,) and have removed the case. I *think* it's improved, but it's still happening every now and then. the phone is moving around on the hard plastic a lot more…

At this point, I’m surprised Apple hasn’t just configured iOS to respond to audio playback identically to MacOS - that is, allowing multiple audio sources to play at once without interrupting one another. ::I would like to know how Android handles this, actually.:: With the possible exception of opening a camera application (or not really, actually,) there is no reason to interrupt Apple Music, Bandcamp, Soundcloud, or a simple audio stream in a browser - *especially* when the device is unlocked and in use.

I bring this up because I saw mention of 14.5 in "[Responding to Audio Session Interruptions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfaudio/avaudiosession/responding_to_audio_session_interruptions)" in the dev documentation:

> Most apps rely on the system’s default interruption behavior. However, beginning in iOS 14.5, AVAudioSession provides ways to customize the default behavior to better accommodate your app’s needs:
> * Recent iPad models provide a feature that mutes the built-in microphone at the hardware level when the user closes the device’s Smart Folio cover. If your app plays and records audio, you may want to continue playback even if the system mutes the microphone. You can disable the default interruption behavior by setting the overrideMutedMicrophoneInterruption option when configuring your audio session.
> * System alerts, such as receiving an incoming phone call, interrupt the active audio session. If you prefer that the system not interrupt your app’s audio session in these cases, you can indicate this preference by setting a value for the setPrefersNoInterruptionsFromSystemAlerts(_:) method.
