* Tom Critchlow is an exception! He uses adjacent terms in describing his work sometimes, but **they all lead to concrete examples**. Not sure if this will end up being the right place to not this.

* By design or not, The Ratio _fundamentally_ disincentivizes discovery, sincere exposure to new perspectives, and indeed most of what we constitute as “human connection.”

* Ultimately, I don't really have a choice but to continue using Twitter as I always have, so I'm going to make the most of it and continue to post whenever and whatever I, myself, would like to see on my timeline - even if my account ends up in such low opinion of The Twitter Algorithm that my Tweets become obfuscated entirely from everywhere on the site save for their full, canonical web addresses, which I will then publish via plain text files hosted on my NeoCities.
