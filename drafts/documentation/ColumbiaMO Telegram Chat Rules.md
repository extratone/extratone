# ColumbiaMO Telegram Chat Rules

*Version 1.0 - 2021-10-02-20.15.17*

Hello, chat! I’ve finally drafted a presentable copy of the Big Bad Chat Rules.

You can find a revision-tracked version of this document on the GitHub repo I created, [here](https://github.com/extratone/columbia/blob/main/rules.md).

1. **ColumbiaMO Local Chat** is a place to discuss current events and culture in a friendly, collegial way. We invite you to be smart, kind, welcoming, funny, charming, incisive, prescient, skeptical: whoever you are on your best day.
2. **ColumbiaMO Local Chat** is reserved for people who live, have lived, or intend to live in mid-Missouri as well as travelers through the area. 
3. Share news, opinions, personal experiences, charts, data, photos, tweets, and other media. Do not share misinformation, disinformation, or spam — including in DMs to other members.
4. Do not promote your own hustles — or your clients’ hustles — more than **once per day**.
5. Disruptive off-topic posts (random interjections) are discouraged and unwelcome.
6. Discuss subjects in good faith. Do not troll, mock, or harass other members of the community.
7. Pseudonyms are welcome, and you do not have to disclose where you work, but do not impersonate anyone.
8. Keep it safe for work. **ColumbiaMO Local Chat** is not the place for disturbing images, racy pictures, or anything else you wouldn’t want to share with your coworkers or family.
9. Be inclusive of all people and points of view. This is particularly true for Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and people in the LBGTQ+ community. We will remove any homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, or racist content without discussion.
10. If someone is bothering you or you would like to report a post or member who you believe is violating these rules, please contact one of the Administrators or Moderators.
11. Final moderation decisions are subject to the whims of the Admins and Mods.
12. We expect to update these rules as necessary. When we do, you’ll see a notification attached to this message.
13. Follow the spirit of these rules as well as the letter of them. Do not become an edgelord. We err on the side of removing borderline content — and borderline users — from the channel.
