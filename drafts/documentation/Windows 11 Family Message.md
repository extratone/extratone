# Windows 11 Family Message

So Windows 11 updates are going to be available starting *tomorrow*! I’ve been playing with it on and off for much of this year but there’s not too much to say other than… beneath the few flash features (trying widgets again, better desktop zones, a new look all-around,) Microsoft really did invest time in actually fixing/smoothing out stuff to an extent that - in my opinion, at least - a much smoother, more robust feeling Windows *is* the headline feature.

The one thing I’d note - they’re relaunching their store as the “Microsoft Store,” and it’s going to be pretty well saturated with scammy paid apps. I would STRONGLY suggest ultra-hesitance before spending any money on the new store. The vast majority of the legitimate applications (including an Alexa app, which I have yet to try) are completely free - you shouldn’t even need to set up billing information to download them. If you do find a paid app that looks worth it, make sure you verify the publisher is legit both within the store *and* on the publisher’s website. 

Notably, **I will literally do this for you any time**. It’s not knowledge-heavy work, or anything, but it can be tedious. It’d be a bonus if you could share prospective software with me here so that others can refer back in the future.

I don’t think any of you have any Windows-running computers old enough for their Windows 11 eligibility to be in question, but let me know if you do and I’ll check.

If you’re like me and hate system update prompts just appearing out of the blue, I’ll do my best to let you know as soon as it becomes available in the Windows Update settings menu in Windows 10. When that time comes, all you’ll need to do is start a search for “update” or “windows update” in the Start menu and the only result should be the right one. From there, using the `Check for updates` button should get the process started, though it might take a while.
