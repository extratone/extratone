# Sidechannel's Server Rules
{>>No, I didn’t create this draft unintentiomally<<}
1. Sidechannel is a place to discuss current events and culture in a friendly, collegial way. We invite you to be smart, kind, welcoming, funny, charming, incisive, prescient, skeptical: whoever you are on your best day.
2. Sidechannel is reserved for people who are currently paying for at least one of the newsletters it was created to support. If you grabbed an invitation link from someone else, or your paid subscription lapses, we reserve the right to remove you from the server — though we’ll give you a chance to subscribe first!
3. Share news, opinions, personal experiences, charts, data, photos, tweets, and other media. Do not share misinformation, disinformation, or spam — including in DMs to other members.
4. Do not promote your own hustles — or your clients’ hustles — except for in designated channels.
5. Stay on topic. Good conversations meander, but keep truly off-topic posting to the lounge.(edited)

6. Discuss subjects in good faith. Do not troll, mock, or harass other members of the community.
7. Pseudonyms are welcome, and you do not have to disclose where you work. But do not impersonate anyone.
8. Keep it safe for work. Sidechannel is not the place for disturbing images, racy pictures, or anything else you wouldn’t want to share with your entire company.
9. Be inclusive of all people and points of view. This is particularly true for Black, Indigenous, and people of color, and people in the LBGTQ+ community. We will remove any homophobic, transphobic, misogynistic, or racist content without discussion.
10. If someone is bothering you or you would like to report a post or member who you believe is violating these rules, please contact one of the co-hosts. If the channel is managed by a particular host, start with them.
11. Final moderation decisions are subject to the whims of the newsletter writers.
12. We expect to update these rules as necessary. When we do, we’ll tell you in the announcements channel.
13. Follow the spirit of these rules as well as the letter of them. Do not become an edgelord. We err on the side of removing borderline content — and borderline users — from the server.
