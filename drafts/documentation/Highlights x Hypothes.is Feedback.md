# Highlights x Hypothes.is Feedback

so this is a big stretch, but I thought I’d mention it considering my doing so in the Command Browser Discord seemed to provoke a somewhat-constructive discussion.

there’s a service called *Hypothesis* (https://web.hypothes.is) which has been my personal favorite attempt to create a universal “social annotation” service. they’ve got browser extensions but are (imo) in serious need of *any* support on iOS/iPadOS. I’m not a developer, but from what I can deduce, it looks like their APIs are well-documented and just waiting for an auspicious developer to come along and utilize.

I know I would personally *kill* for a smoother method of using Hypothesis on my iPhone…

just a thought.
