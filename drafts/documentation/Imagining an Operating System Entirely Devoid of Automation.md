In first-time conversation with a friend who has worked for the same ISP for 8 years...

I asked what overnights actually involve for him:

What came to my mind:

```
already highlighting my lack of knowledge… as far as I understand those two tasks… the first, especially… I guess I’m surprised that’s still something you need to have a human do.

specifically imagining if windows was unable to reasonably distribute its own network services and you had to do it yourself lol

> On the physical side of networking, obviously you need a person, but you'd think that on the non-physical side of things (logical side) you could just script it or it would handle its self. But in reality most networks of established service providers are fairly old and a lot of it isn't automated, and even the stuff you can automate or script often runs into unexpected errors when trying to process changes do to software or firmware versions causing conflicts. For example, there is a company called MikroTik, they make routers and switches, they pushed out a firmware update a few years back that changed the configuration syntax, which broke a lot of routers in production. Did they auto update as designed, yes - but did it result in the intended behavior by most users of the product, no
