# Email client

I like the Spark app. 

- The interface is pretty clean. 
- It has a bunch of keyboard shortcuts making it nice to use with an external keyboard. 
- It is trivial to interface with various cloud providers.
- It is trivial to save an email as a PDF.
- It is trivial to create a "link" to an email for sharing.
