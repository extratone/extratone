# Marco! Shortcut Documentation
## The definitive lost-in-the-couch solution.

So the idea behind this shortcut:

You've lost your phone under the couch cushions somewhere and you use Hey Siri by saying "Hey Siri! Marco!" and the shortcut responds with my actual voice (in this version) saying "Polo bitch!", and then followed by 

1. Flashlight flashing
2. A brief sound clip (via base64 decoding like my voice)
3. Siri blabbing in various different ways.

The challenge for me has been determining what will work when the phone is locked. The last version I tested on Beta 5 worked 100%, but on Beta 6.... it just won't give consistent results so.

If you could just lock your phone, use "hey siri test marco" to trigger the shortcut and then tell me how far it gets, it would help tremendously. Even just one or two attempts._
