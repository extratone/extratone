Description = Scan anything: objects, people, animals, plants, books, documents, text, and art. Scan Thing is the quickest and easiest way to capture and save anything around you.
Capture books and documents with the original images intact and the text embedded. Save your scan as a single- or multi-page PDF with all its text fully searchable and selectable.
Just the text? Frame a page, a document, a sign, or a receipt. Tap to extract the text. Tap again to copy it to the clipboard.
Export is easy. Share via Airdrop or text. Save to your photo library or a folder of your choice. Or copy your scan to other apps.
No nonsense. Just the app. You don't need an account to use Scan Thing. You don't need internet access. Your scans never leave your device and all processing happens on your device. Because your privacy is important (not to mention none of our business), we collect no data whatsoever and we don't use any third-party code. Your privacy is yours, and we think it should stay that way.
A one-time in-app purchase. No subscriptions. No adds. No shenanigans. You can try Scan Thing for free, and, when you're ready, you can unlock unlimited scans with one payment.
