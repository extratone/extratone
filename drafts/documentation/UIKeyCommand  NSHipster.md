excerpt: "As part of the push for greater productivity on the iPad, iOS 9 adds *Discoverability*, an overlay showing the currently available key commands inside an app. This small change suddenly makes key commands far more viable on the iPad and, with it, makes `UIKeyCommand` a necessary addition to your app."
