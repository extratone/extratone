## About
Iâ€™ve personally found this Shortcut absolutely invaluable and surprisingly reliable in its ability to quickly capture the entirety of the text I *actually want* from a given web page/article. The format of its output (see below) took a lot of fiddling to get to its current layout, but it is completely configurable as per your preference.
