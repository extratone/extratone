Are y'all talking about embedding image *files* within an email? As far as I understand email, technically, that sounds like it would be a nightmare. 

If I may, as someone who uses my phone to compose/edit/publish as often as I use my desktop, I'd ask you to reevaluate the snap.as workflow just one more time...

To be honest, I thought the separation of the image service was really strange and janky when I first started using Write.as but I absolutely LOVE it now. It has made me so much more efficient, *especially* on mobile.
