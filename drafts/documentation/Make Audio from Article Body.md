## About

**Note: this shortcut requires iOS 15 Developer or Public Beta 6**

Building on Apple’s own “Speak Body of Article” shortcut found in the default Siri Shortcuts Gallery, this Shortcut takes advantage of the upcoming “Make Audio From Text” action arriving in iOS 15 (which has finally been fixed as of Developer Beta 6) to generate an .m4a audio file of Siri Voice 2 (by default) reading the article’s body aloud (rather than just speaking it aloud on your handset/iPad, as the original does,) with appropriate metadata from the inputted webpage. 

As configured by default, it should function from the Share Sheet in Safari *and/or* by grabbing a web URL from the clipboard.

A full explanation/detailed guide can be found [**on my blog**](https://bilge.world/siri-tts), and the full text of the latter portion (in first draft form) has been posted beneath the contact details immediately below.
