# Conclusions (and rants)

For the long run, ofcourse, I would not recommend this kind of a setup. There is some learning and fun in getting a "resticted" device to function well, but as a main machine, probably no, at least not for the next few months. A comparably priced laptop (say M1 Macbook Air) would offer a lot more.

There are many things I'm missing:

- Projection to a projector and screen recording do not work at the same time. 
- No proper dev environment like VSCode
- A lot of screen size is "wasted" due to the OS
- A lot of the apps are not as good as I'd like. For instance, perhaps a minor thing, but the Youtube app doesn't have a keyboard shortcut for full screen. One can ofcourse do the same on Safari. iMovie in Mac has a remove background noise feature that works very well. The iPad version does not have the same.
- Safari though much improved over the years is not as functional as Safari on the Mac
- While quicklook/Files is good, the functionality of something like Preview is hard to beat
- The files app can not show hidden files and folders
- Powerpoint does not have features like audio recording (though can play)
- Keynote, Pages, Numbers require additional clicks than their Mac counterparts
- When I connect to an external display, I get thick black bars and moreover, if the monitor does not give me an HDMI out, I can not hear audio as the audio is also routed. As good as the iPad's display is, it is not huge and strains my eyes after a while. 
- Copy pasting using the keyboard is a hit and miss. For instance, it fails several times for me when copying from a pdf. Right clicking and copy seems to always work, but, it is more steps than Command C, Command V.
- I miss some quality apps like OBS Studio, especially being an academic teaching remotely due to the pandemic.
- While a-shell is amazing, it is limited by what webassembly can do. At the time of writing, it does not support multithreading and thus the performance of utilities like `ffmpeg` is severely limited. Also, a-shell programs can not be stopped intermediate in their execution. See the following two bugs on Github related to this:
