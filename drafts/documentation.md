</audio>

Eighty days ago, Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering ~~stood up in front of a crowd of~~... 

No!... It was just me... Alone, in my mother’s basement, on a Monday morning, contorted at stupid angles, typing to my phone with a physical keyboard and unapologetically scarfing as much as I possibly could of the Apple community’s unbelievably unreserved, almost *spiritual* volume of **pure hype** from as many simultaneous sources as I could manage. (Hilariously, *all* of said sources are/were Discord servers, now, as in that “gamer” communications service I launched my little indie mag on in 2015 and [kept comparing to Slack](https://bilge.world/discord-slack-comparison), but like an actual madman.)

Anyway, said Senior Vice President of Software Engineering (who we are encouraged to hold accountable for basically all technical changes to iOS) is named Craig, and these are his first few sentences:

> For many of us, our iPhone has become indispensable. And at the heart of iPhone is iOS. iOS powers the experiences we've come to rely on. This year, we were inspired to create even more meaningful ways iPhone could help you. Our new release is iOS 15. It's packed with features that make the iOS experience adapt to and complement the way you use iPhone...

I’m dwelling on them because they are **patently meaningless**. Very little to nothing coming in iOS 15 is what I would call *ease-of-use-centric*. Some of it - namely controversial (and now backpedaled) changes to the user interface of Safari - feels almost maliciously quartered in the opposite direction. Most of the changes in the subheadings of [**the full feature list**](https://www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/) are simply irrelevant in the use for all but the dorkiest iOS users, like myself, and I find the fact unacceptable, at the very least.

![The Foundation Image](https://i.snap.as/t2IieKLq.png)

This is why I would like to try something different, this year, and focus on an entirely different audience: my family, as representatives of the vast majority of the iPhone’s billion-something demographic (read: customers.) That is to say, who Craig *should* be referring to with the phrase “most of us.” Not because I believe them to be “dumb” or “end users” (in the tech bro derogatory sense,) but because they are busy, working people who depend on their iPhone as a *utilitarian* device, above all else. They don’t have the time to dive deep into Apple documentation or watch the whole WWDC presentation to gain an understanding of where to look for new features or (unfortunately) how to turn them off. Realistically, they don’t even have time to read this whole Post, though I hope they will (sorry fam.) 

Regardless of how we feel about it, Apple has made it clear that our phones are going to be further and further inundated with automated processes in the background. Whether you like it or not, your phone is going to be used to help find other users’ devices over the Find My network, your travel information is going to be used to inform Apple Maps’ live traffic statistics, and so on. For the more conservative members of my family, related truths about their phones are going to continue to feel like we are continuing to give up “ownership” of our devices. There are definitive alternatives, but they involve giving up a whole lot of conveniences. I will do my best to address this a bit later on, drawing from much more articulate critics than I.

![Testing Home Screens for iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/eBBnwCIn.png)

What I *will* dwell on, myself, are the more menial, tactile implications of these abstract changes in design philosophy. A general theme of my own use/writing about iOS has been re-finding or jury-rigging the “buttons” which are gradually being obscured or eliminated entirely in the assumption that Apple’s automation knows better than us users when something should happen or change. A great example: using [a simple Siri Shortcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/ac6a4587d5b54abc934631c214d81c0c) to completely disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth instead of trusting the [unnecessarily complex conditions](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208086) of doing so with the buttons in Control Center. I have sought out these “hacks” (as other iOS powerusers have rather absurdly called them) for very selfish reasons. 

Quite simply, the more automated iOS has become, the less comfortably in control I have felt. For myself, at least, every single functional automation Apple has introduced has drastically failed to simplify my own using life, and the vast majority have in fact complicated it dramatically. Apple-adjacent publications and greater tech media have ceased all-out criticism and instead resorted to justifying and explaining (or attempting to, anyway) just about all of Apple’s subtle retractions of user control over the years, but apparently, I am too much of a control freak to let it go. I have been here since the very beginning, have bitched loudly all along, and do not plan to go quietly into that automated night. This theme pervades throughout this review, so for any of you who *do* feel like iOS’ automations fit comfortably into your life, please keep this in mind. 

![Safari Settings in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/oHqejXq1.png)

## The Gist

Rounder, still! From the first time you enter your passcode immediately after installing iOS 15, you’ll notice that Notifications and other elements have had their rounded corners *further* rounded, for some reason. Assuming Safari ships with its new look turned on by default, the screenshots embedded above show two locations (subject to change) where one can switch it off. (Your best bet is to visit [**its menu in Settings**](prefs:root=SAFARI) as displayed on the right in `Settings ⇨ Safari`.) As of this writing, at least two of iOS 15’s “headlining” features have been pushed to further iterative updates: [SharePlay](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/ios-15-apple-shareplay-tv-delay-b1904548.html) and [iCloud Private Relay](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/25/icloud-private-relay-ios-15-public-beta/). I suspect you will be prompted to explore Focus Modes upon initial installation, which I will eventually analyze in relative detail. Ideally, you’ll also be prompted to explore “Shared With You,” which I personally believe to be the release’s most significant addition for most people, by far. 

As far as "meaningful ways iPhone could help you," I see little more than glimmers. Focus Modes would be promising were they not so complex to set up, and Notification Summaries are (as of this moment) a pretty hopeless implementation of a theoretically useful concept. Some additional filters in Apple Maps search will prove useful so long as the associated metadata has been updated for locations *other* than San Francisco (say, mid-Missouri.) Optical Character (text) Recognition has been implemented “system wide” under the feature Apple terms “Live Text,” and translation has finally been extended to the places where it’s most useful (think: Safari.) 

In general, though, most of what’s coming with iOS 15 has little real value in the day-to-day experience for most iPhone users. A complete inversion of Craig’s phrase feels significantly more accurate: *This year, we were inspired to create even more superficial ways iPhone could temporarily dazzle tech media*. 

And now, I’d like to take you through what I feel are the considerations I’d like my family to know - namely my 70-year-old mother, who depends 100% on her iPhone and MacBook Pro every day to run her private practice - but also my ~8 nieces and nephews spanning 6th grade-graduate school, who all - if I’m not mistaken - have iPhones.

```markdown
Worthy of note: this “review” is very heavily focused on *iOS* - which is to say *iPhone* - to the point where any overlap with iPadOS/MacOS/WatchOS/HomeOS/any other goddamned operating system is purely coincidental. For coverage of those changes, please seek your regular sources.
```

![Shared With You - Photos App in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/5otqrdNU.png)

## Photos

### Shared With You

The single most important/welcome feature addition to iOS 15 for most people, I believe, is found in Apple’s native Photos app and entitled **Shared With You**. This view - found in the second tab in the bottom navigation row (“For You”) - is a reverse-chronological timeline of every bit of media (photos & videos) you’ve ever been sent over iMessage. For those with a lot of iOS-using friends (unlike myself,) I would imagine the list will take quite a while to populate. 

### Memories

I find Alex Guyot’s bit on changes to Memories (from [his iOS 15 overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ios-and-ipados-15-the-macstories-overview/)) much more concise than what I’d written, so here it is almost in full:

> Memories can now be set to your favorite songs from Apple Music, and can be customized with color filters. Setting different filters will result in different song choices and transition effects to nail a wider variety of vibes on Memories videos.  

> While watching a video generated by Memories, you can tap and hold at any time to freeze a photo so that it doesn’t transition away. The song playing over the video will not pause when you do this, but when you let go the remaining video transitions and timings will be automatically altered to match back up with the song’s beat.  

> If you don’t want to go with the song that was chosen automatically, you can tap the new Music button to get a pop-up interface into Apple Music, allowing you to choose a song manually. This interface will include smart suggestions for other songs that Apple thinksd you’ll like which would also fit the vibe of your video.  

https://youtube.com/watch?v=7uFR_bSxhTg

Yeah. I hope you’re at least half as amused as I have continued to be by algorithmic video generation. [The above result](https://youtu.be/7uFR_bSxhTg) was created with absolutely zero modification from an album of images and videos which Photos automatically created via face recognition. The only other coherent option from my own limited set of photos is really the only one that matters, I think you'll agree. "Pet Friends" yielded [inevitably uplifting results](https://youtu.be/-1bA7-oslkc) in all three of my test renders, but - given a crop of cute dog photos - little intelligence is necessary to produce.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1bA7-oslkc

If you're experiencing any sort of Déjà vu from the idea of auto-generated slideshows with rights-free soundtracks in the Photos app, it's because Apple has made several distinct attempts to implement very similar iterations of the feature throughout iPhone's history, which has involved iMovie on iOS and MacOS once or twice. I have fiddled with every one - including iOS 15's - and my (truly sound and original) advice is to **avoid spending time trying to customize auto-generated videos** in general. If you explore one of the suggested Memories and find the software's default result satisfactory, of course you should save it, but be wary of any attempts to take editorial control yourself.

![Visual Lookup Indicator in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/74HOlnLP.png)

### Visual Lookup

Perhaps the most unjustifiable background use of your phone’s resources introduced in iOS 15, “Visual Lookup,” seeks to identify “popular art and landmarks around the world, plants and flowers out in nature, books, and breeds of pets” present in your photos so that you might… identify them more swiftly(?) The only means of distinguishing photos on which Visual Lookup has been applied is to look for the modified ⓘ symbol at the very bottom of your screen in the photo browsing view (see the screenshot embedded above.) As you might notice in the screenshots *below*, not one of its analyses on my own images was usably accurate. 

The decision to target the feature on identifying domesticated pets, specifically, is more universalizing than historic landmarks, for sure, but it also immediately sets up the technology (at least this preview of it) for failure.  

![Visual Lookup in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/AtxzN45h.png)

### Metadata

Hooray! You can now view an image's basic details in the "Info pane," by swiping up on an image or using the ⓘ button. This includes the extension (type) and size of the image file, camera identification and configuration details, and -  as part of Shared With You - from whom/where you got the image. Bizarrely, the "Adjust" tool also lets you alter a given image's timestamp and location information. While I can imagine infinitely many reasons why you'd want to *omit* or *delete* such information, I cannot conceive of a single wholesome reason why one would chose to *change* it, instead. 

![Photo Stacks in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/93BGmX4I.png)

### Messages

Just a few weeks shy of [iMessage's tenth birthday](https://web.archive.org/web/20120308031950/https://www.apple.com/ios/features.html), Apple has finally added a button to save incoming photos directly in Messages conversations. It's about as blatant as Apple interface design gets - you'll spot it opposite others' images. Tapping it saves the appropriate photo(s) directly to the Recents folder before a silly animation vanishes the button itself.

Once again, from Mr. Guyot:

> Groups of photos that you send will now be shown as stacks instead of in a long list, allowing you to more easily swipe through the images without losing track of the conversation around them. Tap on a stack to open a grid view where you can see and select multiple photos at once.  

I took the screenshot embedded above in iOS 15 Developer Beta 5, and… Do “stacks” not look hilariously janky as fuck? 

![Live Text in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/DNJOKq85.png)

### Live Text

For someone like myself, iOS 15’s system-wide integration of Optical Character Recognition is undoubtedly its most useful addition by far. Throughout the Developer Beta, it’s moved up this list gradually as I’ve come to see how it could be useful for *you*, as well. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3kj0-q4k9k

The [video embedded above](https://youtu.be/y3kj0-q4k9k) is a very rough demo, but I suspect it’s more “authentic” than most you’d see elsewhere. The ability to *accurately* capture text right from the camera is invaluable, but for most folks, *line breaks* are going to be a real problem. I’m working on a way to address this with a Siri Shortcut, which I’ll obviously share here when/if I succeed. 

## Audio

https://youtube.com/watch?v=KhxtfW0taIY

### Background Sounds

My eldest sister has used a sound/noise machine to sleep for as long as I can remember, so I was especially excited to show her iOS 15’s native “Background Sounds” feature, but she was distinctly unimpressed, noting that her iPhone-based sound generation needs were well met by third-party apps she’d already discovered.[^1] I didn’t have time to try out her recommendations, but I’m going to assume they aren’t able to operate “behind” *additional* audio playback like the “new” native feature is.

![Background Sounds Interrupt Remedy](https://i.snap.as/SGQt93K4.png)

My personal (hopefully insightful) anecdote: Background Sounds appear to be impervious from the audio interruption issues iOS has struggled with since its origin, which makes them a partial remedy to the discomfort of sudden, unexpected silence when using headphones with active noise cancellation. As configured in the screenshot embedded above (the menu found in `Settings ⇨ Accessibility ⇨ Audio/Visual ⇨ Background Sounds`) - with “Use When Media Is Playing” toggled `OFF`- your selected Background Sound *should* fade in when normal playback from another app is interrupted.[^2] 

### “Spatial Audio”

Just to be clear, I strongly believe that normal users should basically ignore all mention of Apple’s “Spatial Audio” (read: don’t worry about it) for a few reasons, most of which aren’t all that interesting. Since [one of my very first written works on tech](https://bilge.world/mono-audio-playback) was/is directly related to the subject, though, indulge me for just a moment for an attempted explanation. Firstly, I must note that only two audio channels (the stereo experiences in various forms you’ve certainly had in your life, regardless of who you are) are necessary for audio to become “spatial.” If you’re curious about this, [my favorite all-time web experience from *The Pudding*](https://pudding.cool/2018/02/waveforms/) is an absolutely impeccable next destination. Secondly, the actual technology behind Apple’s title was not developed by Apple, but by Dolby. It’s not that Apple doesn’t acknowledge this thoroughly in [their explainer docs](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182), nor is Dolby by any means a wee organization in need of my amplification, but this is one of those Apple habits that’s become a particular peev. If you’re interested, [here is the actual spec sheet for Dolby Atmos in PDF](https://professional.dolby.com/siteassets/cinema-products---documents/dolby-atmos-specifications.pdf).

![Control Center Decibel Meter](https://i.snap.as/1vGTW0Iz.png)

If you happen to have either AirPods Pro or AirPods Max devices, an iPhone 7 or later, *and* an Apple Music subscription, you might want to disregard my cynicism at least long enough to try "[dynamic head tracking](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212182)."

### SharePlay

*The Verge*’s Chaim Gartenburg did [an excellent - if a bit precocious - job of explaining](https://www.theverge.com/22577178/shareplay-how-to-apple-facetime-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-apple-tv-video-music) what he describes as iOS 15’s “headline feature,” called SharePlay:

> It’s a new software feature on top of FaceTime that allows you to watch and listen to movies, TV shows, music, podcasts, and more with friends and family while video chatting.  

In my opinion, SharePlay represents one of those great, well-thought solutions to some notably youth-specific challenges which nobody (even the youth) will see as more worthwhile than their own. By that I mean, one ear bud per person… now, an ancient tradition. I’ve deprioritized it, in contrast to Chaim, because I’d bet it’s also one of those things one can only learn themselves.

![Notifications in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/TFWvW1b6.png)

## Notifications, Focus, and Attention

Yes, notifications have gotten *even rounder still* for some reason in iOS 15. Contact photos and “larger app icons” also “make them easier to identify,” according to Apple. (This is the one point in my whole writing life where the phrase *well I’ll be the judge of that!* is 100% valid and applicable.) There’s also a new feature called **Notification Summary** which is an absolutely useless and unnecessary complication, at least at the moment. Honestly, the one bit of solid advice from [*The Social Dilemma*](https://bilge.world/the-social-dilemma) was… Just turn all Notifications off, or at least as many as possible. Notifications Summary feels like a near direct response to that one goddamned film, and its new Focus Modes do even more so.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=YZCx-9wF3ow

### Focus(es)

The most glaringly standout parallel between Microsoft’s Windows 11 release (which I have also been beta testing much less dutifully for most of this year) and Apple’s stated goals in iOS 15’s design centers around the design supposition that maximum malleability of the “spaces” in which one dwells on their operating system - namely, the “desktop(s)” and/or “home screen(s)” - lends toward a more healthy digital occupancy of them, especially in terms of attention. Unfortunately, both of them chose respective solutions which - from my view, anyway - **add complexity** more than anything.

[*The Verge*’s guide](https://www.theverge.com/22665196/ios-15-focus-modes-custom-icons-widgets-how-to) frames Focus as a customization feature to be used in tandem with [custom app icons](https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change) to fiddle your way into your own *bespoke iPhone experience*. I could be wrong, but I suspect very few among my family will find the time investment required worth the end result, but we’ll see.

![Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/mxwVtN7p.png)

I chose to embed [Matt Birchler’s guide to Focus](https://youtu.be/YZCx-9wF3ow) above because it’s by far the most succinct and helpful video I’ve yet seen on iOS 15, generally, and demonstrates how a working person might actually use Focus. My one addendum to this (and any other Focus) guide: **proceed *without* the automated bits** by avoiding anything under the `TURN ON AUTOMATICALLY` subsection of the menu. For whatever reason, location-based automation triggers on iPhone, especially, have literally **never** functioned usefully (or *reliably*) in my experience. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40y7iLdfOnM

## Maps & CarPlay

(I *am* going to do a bit of editorializing on this subject, specifically.) If the video embedded above is confusing, know that it's a very insular joke - over six years ago, in [my video review of the Nissan Juke NISMO](https://bit.ly/JukeHonk), I praised its integrated navigation screen specifically for its frugality. 

> I'm not old. I don't need a gigantic nav screen. I don't need to see a 3D rendition of the whole Earth and my position relative to it.

...and yet, a playful, exploratory experience is what Apple has in mind for Maps, apparently. Here's their description of the new "Interactive globe" feature:

> Discover the natural beauty of Earth with a rich and interactive 3D globe, including significantly enhanced details for mountain ranges, deserts, forests, oceans, and more.

In the footnotes, it’s explained that the feature will only be available on "iPhone with A12 Bionic or later," meaning the iPhone X range, basically, which makes sense considering the extent of animation and touch manipulation technology present in this view. It’s an entertaining plaything, but not much more, which is strange and frustrating. If I could gather the usage statistics across all my family’s iPhones, how much time would you suppose they’ve spent in Apple Maps to date *screwing around* as opposed to *searching and navigating*?

Put another way - Apple’s developmental direction for Apple Maps as a service seems distinctly toward a travel/entertainment application (notably, like [Google Earth](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-earth/id293622097),) instead of a utilitarian navigation app (like [Google Maps](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-maps/id585027354), [Waze](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/waze-navigation-live-traffic/id323229106), or [MapQuest](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mapquest-gps-navigation-maps/id316126557).) It’s not just the Interactive globe. One of the most exciting features in last year’s release (iOS 14) was the ability for Maps users to create custom Guides. I created [my own](https://bit.ly/columbiaguide) containing a few local spots I believe to be especially relevant for first-time travelers/new residents of *my* area. Clearly, I misinterpreted the intended function of Guides entirely - continuing without a means of discovering *user-generated* guides, whatsoever, iOS 15 cements (in my view) that they’ll instead continue to be left to travel magazines, none of which I recognize save for *Atlas Obscura*, who’s “[Hidden Wonders of Chicago](https://guides.apple.com/?lsp=9902&pg=15126682529740253227)” guide appears to be the single worthwhile representation of the Midwest on the service.

![Apple Maps User Account in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/TxDuz5nb.png)

One welcome exception to this absence of investment in user-generated content is the new, unified “user account” view, which aggregates one’s curation (both private and public) along with travel preferences and a list of one’s **contributions** to Apple Maps - another new feature for the app. 

![Place Cards - Apple Maps in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/LX5HW4T3.png)

Above is a screenshot of my first test contribution to Apple Maps (my [mom’s private practice](http://bit.ly/elonglcswam),) which also serves as an example of Maps’ new “place cards.” As of this writing, all of my test contributions are still held "Pending Review," yet navigating to [the share link](https://maps.apple.com/place?address=1714%20Oak%20Cliff%20Pl,%20Columbia,%20MO%20%2065203,%20United%20States&auid=6487223830929868055&ll=38.933965,-92.387854&lsp=9902&q=Eileen%20Long,%20MSW%20LCSW&_ext=CjIKBQgEEOIBCgQIBRADCgQIBhByCgQIChAACgQIUhAECgQIVRAACgQIWRAGCgUIpAEQARImKZSjW/v4dkNAMW0PujQxGVfAORJ5gVcfeENAQd9/R/9zGFfAUAM%3D&t=m) with a desktop browser indicates they've already been made public.

![3D Hy-Vee](https://i.snap.as/SILn5LmG.png)

### CarPlay

As of this writing, it’s unclear how much of the Maps features I’ve used will be carried over to CarPlay upon iOS 15.0.0’s official release, but I know for *certain* that CarPlay is a weekly (if not daily) used feature by virtually all of my family members. With the additional variable of [differences in support between given automobile marques/models](https://www.apple.com/ios/carplay/available-models/) - including which support [Car Key](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211234) - it’s difficult to say definitively what will have changed about your personal CarPlay use. What experience I do have using CarPlay has been exclusively with my mom’s [2019 Volkswagen Jetta](https://youtu.be/hqQqfdHsGx0,) and documented visually in [this photo gallery](https://snap.as/extratone/ios15) as well as [on my alt Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dieselgoth/channel)’s “iOS & iPhone” IGTV Series.

![Apple Maps Night Navigation](https://i.snap.as/iQD53oId.png)

To once again cite from [the official full features list](https://hyp.is/Cbc_LBUmEey4S4Mcwd1lKA/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15-preview/features/):

> An all-new driving map helps you see traffic, incidents, and other details that affect your drive at a glance. See incredible road details like turn lanes, bike, bus, and taxi lanes, medians, crosswalks, and much more. When approaching a complex interchange, Maps switches to a 3D road-level perspective to help you find your way."

"It's faster and easier to report an issue in Maps" is a standout, literal statement. Once you've navigated to the menu in the screenshot below (via the chatbox with exclamation point icon,) touching any of the three options will *immediately* report its respective information without confirmation.

![Report an Incident - CarPlay in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/VKfuhJvH.png)

The default **Driving Focus** can be configured to activate automatically as soon as CarPlay connects which *would* be the single exception from my earlier advice against automating Focus modes at all were it not for the mode's lockout from the Lock Screen (as shown in the first of the three screenshots embedded below.)

![Driving Focus in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/m5974FcB.png)

Once you've locked your device with the Driving Focus on, you must clear an extra step to unlock it by selecting "I'm Not Driving," which then turns the Focus off. In my (unsolicited) opinion, this renders the Focus unusable at best and arguably downright dangerous. "Hey Siri!" is an option most folks I know leave off and I can't imagine a single reason to add such an obstruction. 

![Custom Car Focus - iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/xcNfKv6g.png)

I *can* offer a solution, however, in the form of my custom Car Focus, which only allows calls and texts from my mom, open a single, otherwise-hidden custom (work-in-progress) Home Screen with exclusively driving/nav/travel-relevant apps, and even activates automatically via a very simple automation in [the Shortcuts app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shortcuts/id1462947752). Technically, the only feature it's missing from the default Driving Focus are automatic text replies, which (as of beta) weren't working anyway.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-hNCsS4I0uk

For those new to Siri Shortcuts completely, I recorded a [rough video guide](https://youtu.be/-hNCsS4I0uk) on how to set up both the Focus and its automation.

![Reminders in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/0tsmBGe3.png)

### Reminders

“A to-do list is, ultimately, nothing more or less than an attempt to persuade yourself” concludes [a feature by Clive Thompson](https://www.wired.com/story/to-do-apps-failed-productivity-tools) in the most recent issue of *WIRED*. In the face of a literally indigestible volume of available (and *award-winning*!) Task Management applications found on iOS - [Microsoft To Do](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-to-do/id1212616790), [Microsoft Lists](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-lists/id1530637363), [Todoist](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/todoist-to-do-list-tasks/id572688855), [Things 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/things-3/id904237743), [Fantastical](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fantastical-calendar-tasks/id718043190), [GoodTask](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/goodtask-to-do-list-tasks/id1068039220), [OmniFocus 3](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/omnifocus-3/id1346190318), and on… - Apple’s Reminders app has always had perhaps the most insurmountable task of all its native applications in remaining competitive. Up until I wrote this review, my personal list in the app was nothing but a wasteland of forgotten, out-of-context items from up to 7 years ago (!) which I’d obviously set with Siri without bothering to correct its voice recognition.

Before you proceed to experiment with Reminders, I’d recommend using my [Reminders Backup Siri Shortcut](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/10118) to create a .zip file of *all* existing items in your Reminders app, even if there are just a few. I insist upon this largely because it’s so fast and so frugal. (Here’s [how to allow the addition of Siri Shortcuts from third-party sources](https://support.apple.com/guide/shortcuts/enable-shared-shortcuts-apdfeb05586f/ios).)

For a particularly positive - but very trustworthy - perspective on the additions to Reminders coming in iOS 15, [John Voorhees’ overview for *MacStories*](https://www.macstories.net/stories/reminders-smart-lists-put-unprecedented-control-in-the-hands-of-users/) is succinct and informative.

https://imgur.com/gallery/u8HxROl

An opportunity for an anecdotal, but genuinely exciting! demonstration is allowed us in Reminders: **Drag & Drop** is, indeed, [*finally here*](https://imgur.com/gallery/u8HxROl).

![Safari in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/14Xf21CA.png)

## Safari

```markdown
Before you read on… If you’re just wondering how to make Safari go back to the way it was before, refer back to the first subhead on this page (“The Gist.”)
```

The one commonality in the experience of every single person finishing up their iOS 15 review/overview/guide: we’ve all saved Safari for the very last minute. I am 99% certain the saga surrounding changes to Apple’s native web browser - along with my personal, reactionary gripes spewed along the past two months of iOS 15’s Developer Beta cycle - were the overwhelmingly affirming factors that led to me pursuing this very review. I have rewritten this portion over and over again, but now that you know how to disable the new look, I’m going to as briefly as possible summarize the changes that are actually relevant to you.

* You can now **pull down to refresh**, which apparently the youths *actually* refer to with the acronym “PTR,” these days.
* **Safari Extensions** might be worthwhile. I **absolutely insist** that everyone reading this install one called **Overamped**, which I have been testing. Basically, you’ll never need to think about Google AMP again, which is an absolute gift, I promise.
* **Tab Groups** will almost certainly be nothing but a nuisance for all but the most ridiculous iPhone poweruses like myself.[^3]

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438980179712479241

If, like me, you’ve always found Bookmark/Favorites management in Safari utterly impossible, you’ll rejoice at the implications of Drag & Drop as demonstrated in the [Twitter video](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438980179712479241) embedded above. 

## Baubles

![OMNIMEMOJI](https://i.snap.as/p8U6kW1g.png)

### Memoji

Finally, the great, terrible Apple God has granted its bizarre animated minimes a torso! I have always found memoji [alarming](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/he03xb), mostly, but now that I’ve paid them mind, I would like to express my sympathy for those of you who enjoy using them. I’m sorry to report that you will still need to go to `Messages` and open the compose window in a conversation in order to select the emoji iMessage app. Though iOS 15 adds full bodies to memoji (and clothes to cover them, as required since Adam & Eve,) as well as “accessible accessories,”[^4] there’s not as yet any way to actually *see* a memoji in full-body view other than the editing interface (as far as I could tell.) You can also choose to separately color your memoji’s eyes. 

![Facetime in The Browser Comedy](https://i.snap.as/vBw0CNhW.png)

### Facetime in The Browser

Yes, you can *technically* Facetime with non-Apple devices thanks to iOS 15's changes. In fact, you'll be able to "Facetime" any device with a web browser! *However*, in doing so you will be forgoing every single one of Facetime's advantages: call quality, "privacy," ecosystem integration, etc. Without these, it would be silly to use Facetime over literally *any* other video calling service. What an immense waste of time, eh?

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430679850399014912

For the sake of thoroughness, though, I should note that I appear to be alone in this view of the new Facetime changes. *MacStories* founder and Ultimate iPad Sage Federico Viticci’s [report on the subject](https://www.macstories.net/stories/facetimes-audio-and-video-take-a-leap-forward-with-apples-upcoming-iphone-ipad-and-mac-os-updates/) was one of mostly satisfaction.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/MicModeTest.flac">
</audio>

I will note, too, that [my test](https://whyp.it/t/testing-the-mic-modes-coming-in-facetime-with-ios-15-54749) of the new “Mic Modes” function yielded impressive results (along with a few other experiences I’ve had so far,) especially in the “Voice Isolation” mode’s performance, but - [as I lamented on Twitter](https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1430680198442332160) - its association with FaceTime makes it unavailable where one actually could make use of it on iOS.

## Omissions

I know it probably doesn’t mean much to you, but in my lifetime of beta testing iPhone updates, I have never experienced such a disastrous cycle as 15’s. [*MacWorld*’s outline](https://www.macworld.com/article/353957/ios-15-features-missing-at-launch.html) of the expected features *not* coming in today’s release from the 7th of this month has no less than *eight* headings: *SharePlay*, *Legacy Contacts*, *App Privacy Report*, *3D CarPlay navigation*, *Universal Control*, *IDs in Wallet*, *Custom iCloud email domains*, and *CSAM scanning features*. 

https://twitter.com/NeoYokel/status/1438960700286717955

For us powerusers, Siri Shortcuts are absolutely fucked and Apple Dork Twitter is livid about it. Personally, I find these to be the least problematic of the unfixed bugs, and I can only hope it means that Apple has prioritized fixes for the features most relevant in *your* life. I will be updating this Post as actively as I can in the coming weeks and always appreciate any questions or thoughts you might have about how I could make it more useful.

[1] If you’re reading this and happen to be looking for app recommendations, let me know and I’ll ask her. 
[2] This wasn’t working reliably in the last Developer Beta, but I’ll do my best to check back for the normal release.
[3] This is one of those things I can’t say more about until I actually hear from other folks… I’ll check back in a month or so.

## Safari

The one commonality in the experience of every single person finishing up their iOS 15 review/overview/guide: we’ve all saved Safari for the very last minute. I am 99% certain the saga surrounding changes to Apple’s native web browser - along with my personal, reactionary gripes spewed along the past two months of iOS 15’s Developer Beta cycle - were the overwhelmingly affirming factors that led to me pursuing this very review. 

Though I’ve disagreed with *a lot* of what John Gruber has had to say lately, [his constructively critical post about “Safari 15”](https://daringfireball.net/2021/07/safari_15_public_betas_for_mac_and_ios) from early July became an important foothold of affirmation for my sanity as greater tech media went *alarmingly* quickly from shock to justification and then to celebration (one not-unpopular take I saw literally called Apple’s decisions “brave.”) I found this passage especially resonant:

> One can only presume that Apple’s HI team thinks they’re reducing needless “clutter”, but what they’re doing is systematically removing the coherence between what apps look like and the functionality they offer.

"There always has to be something up our sleeve," said Apple CEO Tim Cook in an interview I happened to catch in [a bait re-broadcast YouTube stream](https://youtu.be/ki81PEZ3q2U) while writing this. I find it poignant, indeed, recalling my first experience with the new Safari in Dev Beta 1, this past July. I literally thought I'd opened the wrong app. Specifically, the entirely-redesigned interface I saw reminded me a lot of a (living) ghost of [quaint browser concepts past](https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/30/cake-raises-5-million-for-a-swipeable-mobile-browser/)...The general layout of an experimental app called [Cake](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cake-web-browser/id1163553130).

![Cake Browser vs Safari in iOS 15](https://i.snap.as/nJ6h60ql.png)

I won't bore you with any parallels, but I do enjoy the (very fantastic) mental image of Apple Devs huddled around good ole' Cake for inspiration. If you're wondering why I haven't actually named a single one of the *changes* I've been referring to, I thought I might present the entirety of [the Safari section in the full iOS 15 features list](https://hyp.is/c_RW3hWqEeyuMqOqKTovnQ/www.apple.com/ios/ios-15/features/) sandwiched between a set of screenshots from iOS 14.8’s Safari and a set of the same locations in the browser as it stands in the iOS 15 Release Candidate.

![Safari 15 Full Changes List](https://i.snap.as/MvR5xRuv.png)

![Safari in iOS 15 RC](https://i.snap.as/dCJNun47.png)

I think the greatest catalyst for the *emotional* component of the controversy lies in the fact that it represents the first complete redesign in the *entire*, 18-year-long history of the software. Since [Safari 1.0 Beta for Mac](https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/62233/safari_1_0_beta_mac/) in the Spring of 2003

  * They can be launched using the ‘Open URLs’ action of the Shortcuts app as of iOS and iPadOS 13.1.2. Apple may kill this functionality again in the future; hopefully, they won’t.
  * You may be able to launch these URLs without the Shortcuts app, but I haven’t tested it.
  * The URLs are written in English, but they should work for every language you can assign your iOS or iPadOS device. I’ve tested them both in Spanish and Italian and they continued to work.
  * I may have missed a few URLs supported by Settings. If you know of any other URLs that are working in iOS or iPadOS 13.1, feel free to get in touch (either via email or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/viticci)) and I’ll add them to the list below.

In addition to the complete list available below, I’ve also put together a shortcut to launch any of these Settings URLs by picking from a list in the Shortcuts app. The shortcut, called ‘Open Settings’, contains the full list of 120+ Settings URLs and can be used both in the Shortcuts app and widget.

![My shortcut to open specific pages of the Settings app. You can take any URL and make a separate shortcut for it.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2019-10-01-03-07-16.png)

My shortcut to open specific pages of the Settings app. You can take any URL and make a separate shortcut for it.

![](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2019-10-01-03-12-42.png)

### Open Settings

Open a specific page or sub-section of the Settings app. This shortcut contains over 120 Settings URLs, and you can choose which one to open from a list. You can also create standalone shortcuts for each URL.  
The shortcut works in the app, widget, and Siri.

[Get the shortcut here.](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/58ae614ca5ba4958900fcbeb8c1854aa)

I’ve created a shortcut with every URL for reference purposes but, honestly, the best way to launch these URLs is with dedicated shortcuts. Grab the Settings URL you want, create a new shortcut with two actions (‘URL’ and ‘Open URLs’), paste the URL, and you’ll have a custom one-tap launcher to open _any_ section of Settings from anywhere.

![This is all you need to do to open a Settings URL with Shortcuts.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2019-10-01-02-58-50.jpeg)

This is all you need to do to open a Settings URL with Shortcuts.

My favorite way to launch specific pages of Settings is via our own **[MacStories Shortcuts Icons](https://www.macstories.net/pixel/shortcuts/)**, which I’ve assigned to different shortcuts on my Home screen. In the screenshot below, you can see a few examples of my Settings launchers for Control Center, Camera settings, and Software Update based on MacStories Shortcuts Icons (including one that will be part of the next free update to the pack).

My Home screen is still in flux (mostly because [Silvia](https://twitter.com/_silviagatta) made too many icons to choose from, which is a good problem to have), but I like where this is going:

![Settings shortcuts on the Home screen \(right\). The "info" icon will be part of the next free update to MacStories Shortcuts Icons.](https://2672686a4cf38e8c2458-2712e00ea34e3076747650c92426bbb5.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/2019-10-01-16-43-51.png)

Settings shortcuts on the Home screen (right). The “info” icon will be part of the next free update to MacStories Shortcuts Icons.

_You can buy MacStories Shortcuts Icons using the button above, or read more details [here](https://www.macstories.net/pixel/shortcuts/)._

It is my goal to keep this list of Settings URLs up to date over time, and I hope that Apple won’t remove the ability to launch `prefs:root` URLs via the Shortcuts app in future iOS or iPadOS updates.

You can find the full list below.

```
Ideally, on the final, reader-facing page, said code should create a player like this:

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://github.com/extratone/bilge/raw/main/audio/TTS/JohnnyTsunami.m4a">
</audio>

If further configuration of the player is desired or necessary, see [this Mozilla page](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/audio) for a full list of supported options. Obviously, there are a few older methods of embedding audio players, but I am neither qualified nor interested in exploring them. If you’re in a frustrating bind, I recommend [signing up for my CMS](https://bit.ly/extwa). (Just try it, okay?)

### Pwoof

For the sake of bare minimum sample variety, I ran Version 1.0 of the public Make Audio from Article Body shortcut on an article hosted not on WordPress, nor my own CMS, but on Bustle’s ultra-slick, totally-bespoke system (which [began as *The Outline*](https://www.codeandtheory.com/things-we-make/the-outline), FYI.) I chose the first permalink I saw in one of its “regular” article formats - not a long feature, nor one of their touch-targeted slideshows.

“[OnlyFans is banning porn, the very thing that made it big](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/onlyfans-is-banning-porn-the-very-thing-that-made-it-big)” is an 870-word newsy piece written by Tom Maxwell, who is the only New York Media person ever to accept my Facebook friend request. (Thanks again, Tom.) Without any tweaking, I was able to run the shortcut (from within the Shortcuts app since the Share Sheet appears to be thoroughly fucked at the moment) in a reasonable amount of time - less than 5 minutes, more than 2 - and generate the file embedded below. Notably, I also used a different hosting service - [mastodon.social](https://mastodon.social/web/statuses/106798701662102859) - but I certainly don’t plan on doing so at scale and neither should you.

<audio controls>
  <source src="https://files.mastodon.social/media_attachments/files/106/798/698/454/727/854/original/2c6d50bcf898af15.mp3">
</audio>

Honestly, *Input*’s CMS is the cleverest challenge I was able to come up with for this single-day-old shortcut of mine, and I’m quite proud of the result. Though it wasn’t able to retrieve a timestamp, it correctly retrieved the article’s title and byline without fuss and even managed to scrape and attach said article’s featured image as the file’s cover art, though the original’s aspect ratio was obviously sacrificed.

### HMU

Before I depart actual tutorializing and return to opining, I want to express *even more aggressively than usual* how much I want *anyone* who see’s any potential benefit the ability to generate audio of my darling Siri Voice 2 reading text, but has further questions/doesn’t have time to fiddle/struggles with my haphazardly-written attempts at guides like this, or who simply wants to talk about any satellite subjects, [**please reach out to me**](https://bit.ly/whoisdavidblue). **You have no idea how much I’d love to help you configure a personal automation that genuinely, reliably, and durably improves your quality of life.**

If you follow this shortlink from within a browser on any iOS device, my full contact card will appear: `bit.ly/whoisdavidblue`. 

Suggestions/requests regarding considerations I’ve obviously missed in this guide are not just *welcome* in this case, but actually *necessary*. As long as I am literally the only person talking about the “Make Spoken Audio from Text” action, I am ready and willing to be an all-hours resource.

## Assumptions in Question

1. For the vast majority of mainstream social users, no amount of [insert vague overused marketing jargon noun] will *ever* result in a substantial accumulation of money/"influence" (which seems to be the diluted zag of "POWER" of the moment.) Those interested in learning about "marketing" should know that no authority on the subject would ever tell you to *start* with Twitter - this I can say with certainty. 
2. Though Twitter was designed upon certain frameworks with certain rules which form quantifiable formulas where they are dependent upon a user's choices/methodology to produce results which we *have*, indeed, become more adept at predicting with study over time, it was *not* created as a *game to be won*. Perhaps more importantly, the "prize" of "winning" in the sense held by those who resist this assumption (notoriety, "influence," relevance) has continued to prove ultimately worthless (or worse) time and time again throughout the very short history of the cultural element as it exists today.
3. If both 1 and 2 pass scrutiny, the only remaining reasonable prerogatives in one’s social media use is to engage with _both_ strangers and friends in a manner which generally **adds value to the lives of all involved**.
4. 3 is not only _possible_ - it is easily _reproducible_. Most of my evidence is centered around my own experiences, but I believe - if I took the time - I would be able to find infinitely many publicly-facing examples. 
5. Though I am going to use my own methods to demonstrate 4, **neither my ideas nor my behavior are the only means of interacting positively on social media**.

### Specific public examples of positively-acting individual accounts
* [Jon Male](https://twitter.com/mrjaydeeem)
* [Matt Farah](https://twitter.com/thesmokingtire) - An example of a celebrity who for the most part sticks to subjects on which he is an authority and invests a lot of intellectual and emotional energy engaging in discussion. In turn, he is also an example of someone who is *actually* “leveraging” his social media use for his business, but in a way that adds value to everybody’s lives. 


> The exchange of **information or services** among individuals, groups, or institutions.
> *Specifically*, the cultivation of **productive relationships** for employment or business.

## Tinder BS

"[Tinder CEO Elie Seidman on finding love during the pandemic](https://www.theverge.com/21284420/tinder-ceo-elie-seidman-interview-dating-pandemic)" | *The Verge*

**NP: Once you find the something more, you probably don’t want to go back to an environment where everyone’s intent is to get to something more. Do you anticipate people are going to spend a long time in Tinder, that they’re going to come back to it again and again throughout their life, or is it once you make the connection, you move on?**

We already see episodic behavior, which makes sense. If you find somebody, you get really connected to them, you date them, it’s maybe a long term relationship. We’re really the only app which says, ==“Just because it doesn’t last forever, doesn’t mean it’s not important.”== It’s still important, and we’re very clear about that. We don’t think everything has to last to be important. As a result, we see very clearly episodic use.

People come, they come for a while, they leave, they come back. If that starts at 18, it’s a journey, and they spend their time on that journey. I don’t think this will change that. I very much hope and expect that people will still form important connections, even if they don’t last forever.

# Use Magic Keyboard with iPhone | iPhone User Guide 
You can use Magic Keyboard, including Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, to enter text on iPhone. Magic Keyboard connects to iPhone using Bluetooth and is powered by a built-in rechargeable battery. (Magic Keyboard is sold separately.)

_Note_: For compatibility information about Apple Wireless Keyboard and third-party Bluetooth keyboards, see the Apple Support article [Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Keyboard compatibility with iOS devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202041).

***
### Pair Magic Keyboard to iPhone
1. Make sure the keyboard is turned on and charged.
2. On iPhone, go to Settings ⚙︎ > Bluetooth, then turn on Bluetooth.
3. Select the device when it appears in the Other Devices list.

_Note_: If Magic Keyboard is already paired with another device, you must unpair them before you can connect Magic Keyboard to your iPhone. For iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, see [Unpair a Bluetooth device](ibooks://1515995528/iph6e757db44.xhtml#iph8f62615e0). On Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences > Bluetooth, select the device, then Control-click its name.
***

### Reconnect Magic Keyboard to iPhone
Magic Keyboard disconnects when you turn its switch to Off or when you move it or iPhone out of Bluetooth range—about 33 feet (10 meters).

To reconnect, turn the keyboard switch to On, or bring the keyboard and iPhone back into range, then tap any key.

When Magic Keyboard is reconnected, the onscreen keyboard doesn’t appear.

***
### Switch to the onscreen keyboard
You need to use the onscreen keyboard instead of an external keyboard to do things like type accented characters or use dictation.

To show the onscreen keyboard, press ⏏︎ on the external keyboard. To hide the onscreen keyboard, press ⏏︎ again.

***
### Switch between language and emoji keyboards
1. On Magic Keyboard, press and hold the Control key.
2. Press the Space bar to cycle between English, emoji, and [any keyboards you added for typing in different languages](ibooks://1515995528/iph3c511601.xhtml#iph73b71eb).

***
### Open Search using Magic Keyboard
Press Command-Space.

***
### Change typing options for Magic Keyboard
You can change how iPhone automatically responds to your typing on an external keyboard.

Go to Settings ⚙︎ > General > Keyboard > Hardware Keyboard, then do any of the following:

* _Assign an alternative keyboard layout_: Tap a language at the top of the screen, then choose an alternative layout from the list. (An alternative keyboard layout that doesn’t match the keys on your external keyboard.)
* _Turn Auto-Capitalization on or off_: When this option is selected, an app supporting this feature capitalizes proper nouns and the first words in sentences as you type.
* _Turn Auto-Correction on or off_: When this option is selected, an app supporting this feature corrects the spelling as you type.
* _Turn “.” Shortcut on or off_: When this option is selected, double-tapping the space bar inserts a period followed by a space.
* _Change the action performed by the Command key or other modifier key_: Tap Modifier Keys, tap a key, then choose the action you want it to perform.

I think if one designed a “crisis-proof” version of the web, it might end up being a network of PDFs. My reasoning being:
- PDFs are universally understood by most people and can be read on phones, desktops, laptops, and eBook readers.
- Once you’ve downloaded a local PDF version of the site, there is no risk that it can be changed or removed by the host.
- File size is predictable ahead of time, which is useful if your connection is limited or slow.
- PDFs are designed for printing (moreso than most sites) which may be useful in situations where electricity is in low supply.

Except the printing part, all can be said about a standalone html file.
External content, like images, can be inlined, thus you would only have to distribute one single .html file.
I'm not sure how would file2file linking work in the realm of pdf files. With html files, it's easy even without any web server.
Plus, html can be even digested through a terminal interface. That cannot be said about the binary nature of pdf documents.

This is true, but I do think a PDF is just conceptually simpler and requires less technical knowledge. Especially in a situation where technical users are scarce.
IMO most people have a mental model of a PDF as being a digital document, whereas a HTML file is somewhat more amorphous.

Pandoc is a converter, not a viewer.
Typically one would view a PDF with a dedicated viewer (xpdf, zathura, kpdf, Okular, Evince, ...), or by converting to text (pdftotext).
less can be extended with hooks (lesspipe) to read a wide range of file types on the console.
Some console file managers can also translate PDFs to text (mc, ranger).

> PDFs are universally understood by most people and can be read on phones, desktops, laptops, and eBook readers.
PDFs need a proprietary app to use, most of which are loaded with spyware & trackers. I may be mistaken in this but MacOS/iOS are the only OSes I know of that read them natively? There's absolutely nothing universal about the format.
HTML is truly universal: not only does every OS come with a built in HTML viewer, but it's a plain text file. You can read the source using anything.
> Once you’ve downloaded a local PDF version of the site, there is no risk that it can be changed or removed by the host.
Once you've downloaded a local HTML version of the page there's no risk that it can be changed or removed by the host. Yes, there's caveats to both: people can create PDFs with remote embeds or HTML sites with ajax content but both of these are the fault/responsibility of the individual author. It's as easy to make good downloadable HTML as downloadable PDF.
The so called "churn" is the responsibility of the individual HTML author. If you're making bad HTML, the fix is to start making good HTML. Not to switch to a closed inaccessible format.

PDF is an open format, with multiple FOSS reader implementations. You could argue that a subset of niche features can only be used in Acrobat Reader, but AR is far from the only PDF reader out there.
And the churn is part of the zeitgeist, not really a responsibility of anyone in particular. Individuals are suckered into it, companies are supplying it, and governments are allowing it. We're all part of it. Not new either: I'm hearing it since the 90s how the modern life is rushed, and that's just my limited experience.

lucideer 1 day ago [–]

I said it wasn't universal, which is somewhat different to the vague idea of being "open", and yes, PDF is technically an "open format" depending on how you define "open". The ISO 32000 spec. costs in the region of ~200 USD/EUR.
What that "openness" translates into in the real world is that there are zero non-Adobe viewers that support all of PDF's features, and even less PDF editors. The standard PDF editor costs ~200 USD/EUR (annual subscription).
This is before we even get into the nightmarish world of PDF parsing. Or PDF accessibility.
PDF is a great format if you're sending a document to someone for them to print immediately. It has no other valid uses imo.

Most desktop operating systems offer a print-to-PDF functionality. It's long been an add-on for Microsoft, but that's really a historical accident / deliberate choice of that platform.
PDFs can be trivially created from Markdown or using LaTeX templates if you're looking for a programmatic solution. Pandox and XeLaTex are helpful, the poppler libraries as well. Again, these are generally and widely available at no charge.

Not sure about your points. Contrast it with a static HTML+CSS website:
- PDFs require a reader, HTML a browser. I wouldn't argue that there are more PDF readers installed than browsers.
- Downloaded static HTML works the same
- File size can be included in the HTTP response: in the Content-Length header
- Printing is nice, but reflowable text is even nicer, since we target a multitude of rendering targets.

The sad thing is, this is what the web was SUPPOSED to be, more or less: a series of static documents, text and images. The only interactivity (setting aside the occasional CGI forms) was that you could click certain images or text and go to other static documents. Documents linked to documents.
Then everyone lost their minds and decided webpages needed to be PROGRAMS and we've been paying the price ever since.

It has its good sides and bad sides. People will download the PDF every month when there is a new issue, but you don't know if they read it, how much time they spend on it, etc. You won't appear on Google Results as you would do if you posted the articles as HTML, etc.

We already have a wildly popular website where all the main content is in the form of PDFs. It’s https://arxiv.org/. PDF is what you use when your document needs to have a predictable layout. This is especially important if it contains math, complex tables, or any elements where meaning is carried by positioning on the page. This can include aesthetic meaning, as in some forms of poetry that need to be laid out in a particular way.

There are several which at least strongly resemble that remark.
Project Gutenberg and the Internet Archive's text archives (along with numerous other document-oriented sites, several of the samizdat variety) offer content in PDF and other document-oriented offline downloadable forats.
Wikipedia has a "save to PDF" link on each article (that seems to work through the browser's capabilities, if any, not all browsers support this). The sister Mediawiki site Wikisource offers ePub downloads.
For longer-form content, PDF, DJVU, and a handful of other formats (arguably ePub) are at least reasonably popular.

I found "PDFs are files" kind of compelling. Perhaps this was a flaw of the original www concept. Web pages were always technically files & documents, but this was always abstracted away from userland. "Save webpage" was never a core feature. This did disempower users.
PDFs are downloaded, saved, emailed around. They can also be linked to. Userland maintains a closer relationship with what's going on. A typical user know that you can have a copy of a file, which may or may not be identical to the online one. WWW, from its initial version, was mysterious. The transition between the model of requesting files from a server by clicking a link to a programmatically generated stream of code executed on your browser happened below typical users perspective.
The wb has obviously gained a lot, but has also lost something.

Maybe it's wordpress, maybe it's my bad css/html skills, maybe something else, not sure. I picked up LaTeX skills about 5 years ago and have just been making lovely PDF books of everything I'm into.

Indeed, there's a lot of irony packed into the first page:
Featured is a quote from LWN indicting the "software industry" and its "brittle dependencies". What's ironic about this? It's squarely about the parts of the software industry that deal in things that are _not_ meant to be painted in the browser.
If you want a solution to the (perceived) churn, it's funnily enough right in the quote from Mark Pilgrim: "I've migrated to HTML 4". HTML is almost certainly not going to end up drifting in such a way that DJB's qhasm bibliography page[1] is ever going to break. HTML and the Web standards in general are, with extremely rare exceptions, cumulative. It's pretty frightening how many technical people don't understand this; the Web is intentionally engineered to serve as "the infrastructure for handling humanity's publishing needs indefinitely"[2]. More frightening is that the biggest threat to this are people like the author here who treat the Web as if it's like any other thing that the computing industry puts out—i.e., already perennially broken. This is dangerous because it anachronistically cedes power to folks who'd try to argue at some point in the future that the things about the Web that they'd like to break (and might be in a position to break e.g. due to browser monopoly) are justified and no big deal, really.
The author goes on to call out the Web ("of rubbish") as "user-hostile". Shortly afterward, he or she writes that "PDF makes a stand against the churn". More accurately, PDF makes a stand against the user, by prioritizing authors' creative whims over the reader's needs. This happens again later in their remarks about PDFs being page-oriented: "you are fundamentally not in control of the reading experience." The "you" here is not you, the actual reader. The control they refer to is, once again, the author's.
You get other poor arguments—that PDFs are "offlineable" "files" that can be distributed "decentralized", none of which are accurate criticisms against what HTML lacks—unless those Java documentation zipballs that seemingly every university student enrolled in a CS program in the early 2000s was made to download are a collective hallucination.
And it gets worse from there. Cute stunt to grab attention and all, but the arguments are fundamentally bankrupt.

It's not a browser format (though browsers can render it), but that isn't the same not being a web format. The web is just the ability to retrieve files from other people's servers, that may themselves reference other files on yet other people's servers. As long as a file format supports hyperlinks, then it's suitable for the web. If you don't care about being able to actually click the hyperlink to activate your desktop system's uri schema handler, then even plain text works fine.

PDF is very far from an ideal format for the today world of different-sized screens. It is a horrible experience on mobile and even worse on eInk pocket books. I would rather advocate making everything available in ePub. Or even better - FB2, it is an easy to grok/implement (designed with manual authoring, simple scripted processing and low-end devices in mind) single-xml structure decoupling the content from the view even more. I often convert ePubs to FB2 (with Pandoc and Calibre) to make PocketBook render them in its native fonts (which always are better) rather than in the font specified in the ePub.
I would also mention that the text within PDFs often is not machine-readable (you copy-paste it and get text without spaces, with additional spaces or complete garbage) but I believe this is easily avoidable if you bake PDFs a proper way.
I could also suggest publishing everything in Markdown (with images embedded in a Base64 section in the bottom) but this doesn't seem practical because browsers, book-reading apps and eInk devices don't support nice rendering of them directly.

* PDFs are files. We must not lose sight of the fact that files are a basic freedom.
This seems like the core belief of the article. And it's at odds with the nature of the web.
In the beginning, the web was a network of devices transmitting files with addressable locations on the device, creating a more or less 1:1 relationship between the devices and the web - the devices WERE the web.
But this inevitably faded as information wants to be... fast and it became easier to whip small data packets around describing state, not files.
I agree with the Unixy belief - files are freedom. But trying to model the entire web on those files is fighting gravity. They're not going anywhere. They just have to travel through the Web Soup sometimes now.
All the technologies enabling a global network of file sharing are still there, the author is just bemoaning today's lingua franca. (json?) And perhaps there is a fear that we will lose sight of "device-based computing" / file ownership.
It has political overtones too... individualism vs collectivism. The web is a very interesting place to hash through those ideas in code before we hash through them in legislation.

It kind of seems like you're describing IPFS, except with worse content addressing guarantees. The vast majority of your users will never check to see if a PDF's content actually match its content address.
> All of these simple-complex propositions about making some subset language or automating document flows are missing the point entirely.
Are they? It's really not that hard to build a self-contained HTML file, and to re-emphasize, signed PDFs and signed HTML files are about the same level of accessibility to most users. Web browsers don't really handle either, if you want those guarantees you need to use a protocol/technology with better support right from the start.
Also to be clear, despite the author's argument that PDFs can be self-contained, no browser guarantees that, and there's no way for me to tell if the PDF is self contained when I click on it in Firefox unless I download it and check it myself offline or in a viewer that guarantees it won't make network requests.
Nothing online that I'm aware of forces authors to use PDF/A, so when I download a PDF, I don't know what I'm getting. It's not actually the magical, re-hostable world that the author claims.
I'm not sure that people are missing the author's point so much as they're saying the author is making claims about the portability of PDFs that aren't necessarily accurate. Yes, it would be good to have better self-contained guarantees about some web-content, but I'm not sure PDFs actually supply any of those guarantees.

While I appreciate the sentiment, I don't think PDF is the way, at least in the way you're currently doing it. PDF maybe supported by browsers, but they're not intended for it, it's secondary feature. Same for search engines. Same for mobile.
Most browsers have Print to PDF. If you want people to be able to download an immutable version of your content, then just have a simple static version of your page with a valid print css, better yet, leave everything default.
If you want to fight churn with PDF, just have a simple HTML website with a link to download a versioned PDF of your issue. Your website can be as simple as https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/ or https://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com.

PDF-fing everything on your website is one way to go about it...
I personally use the service at printfriendly [1] and Arc90's Readability to make un-crufted and readable PDF files of web content that is worth saving for the coming decades. Added bonus: by saving these very small files on my system pressing the Command + Spacebar on my system I can easily search through my multiple decades of interesting files...

There are good points here, but I think the author slightly undermines his message because the layout and typography of this particular PDF is so poor. Probably because it “was written in the world’s greatest web authoring tool: LibreOffice Writer”.
In other words, one advantage of PDF is that free authoring tools such as the TeX family can create typographically beautiful results that are nearly impossible to achieve with HTML, but he leaves that on the table.

I cannot tell if this is satirical or not. Assuming it is not, every single “pro” of PDFs is just plain incorrect except for the one about being “self-contained” to which I point to https://gwern.net as a good example of self-contained HTML. Gwern archives all the pages he references so that they are always available.
In the case this is satire, I applaud it because I did get a few chuckles.

Why not just extremely simple, plain HTML? No frameworks, not even CSS. In fact, you could make your life even simpler by using markdown files and having the browser convert that to HTML in real time with a single JS library (there are a few, I am not promoting anything one particular), so it doesn’t even require a “back end”! Plain HTML, while not having all the “portable” attributes of PDF, is still pretty darn robust and most browsers handle printing (or conversion to PDF) quite well.

Some of the listed benefits don't apply. Notably paginated (PDF) vs. scrolled navigation, but also features such as formulae displays and specific typesetting / layout elements, in-page bookmarks, highlighting, and notes.
For shorter documents that's not much of a problem. For anything much over ~chapter length (about 20 pages or 10,000 words), navigation within a single HTML page becomes painful. Well below that level on smaller devices

Why does it seem like almost everyone doesn't realize that PDFs can easily be made to support all the horrors we see in HTML? No, it's fucking well not impossible -- or even notably difficult -- to jam some malicious dynamic code into a PDF. The only reason a period of widespread fear about PDF viruses hasn't developed as it has for websites spreading malicious code is the fact that websites got much more widely adopted. PDFs have been used as malicious code vectors before, and replacing HTML with PDFs would only result in PDFs being the new common vector for the same problem, with at least the same scale and intensity.
This only seems like a solution if you don't know what PDFs can do -- and, by the way, sometimes pagination is bad, especially static (non-reflow) pagination.
EDIT:
Let's make this clearer.
You can actually embed an entire JavaScript application in a PDF. Tell me again how PDFs somehow prevent the problem of dynamic pages on the web. All using PDFs instead of HTML pages would do is wrap the horrors of the web in forms that are generally more hostile to various viewing contexts for the less harmful use cases (e.g. static pages suddenly being harder to read in some contexts with PDFs than with HTML pages).

There's text/markdown mediatype which can also serve this purpose but it needs a boost from someone with some street cred. People work in predictable ways and this is a political project.

I guess by modern standards this load time is acceptable, but when you argue that PDFs are a way to move forward, you're competing with HTML 4/5. And by that standard:
- Crud this website is so slow. Unacceptably slow. If your technology stack is spending 10 seconds just to fetch and render 13 pages of large-screen text, then either you're doing something wrong or it's a bad technology stack. That load time alone should kill this idea.
- There's no way for me to turn off images. This is the opposite of a client-respecting webpage, the only way you could make it worse is by rendering to Canvas or shipping me a PNG. My mobile browser doesn't fetch fonts by default. You're overriding my choice to do that.
- Mobile? Reflow? Responsive design? Adjustable font sizes? The author kind of offhandedly says that PDFs can do reflow right now, but how many clients actually support that. Does the PDF format handle this by default?
- Saying "you can technically make PDF accessible" is exactly the same as saying "you can technically use just a subset of HTML." It's the same argument. Nobody does it, PDFs are generally hostile to accessibility, and there's no way to signal that a PDF is accessible or enforce it as a community standard.
So, the much bigger question: what's wrong with Gemini[0]? I've been critical of Gemini in the past on multiple fronts, but if you are in this space where you want to burn everything down and make your blog static, Gemini really does seem to solve every problem that the author has, except better. It's also trivial to proxy Gemini documents or statically re-render them to HTML, which makes them accessible to people outside the community. And by default, they're both pretty accessible to screen readers, and much more efficient than what the author is proposing.
The author argues that using static HTML wouldn't be good enough because there's no standard that forces you to exclude Javascript. Then they point to PDF/A, which is not a standard that is enforced by most browser PDF viewers. To me, this argument isn't any different from telling website authors to choose not to use Javascript, what is going to force anyone to use PDF/A? Every web browser PDF reader supports Javascript. NoScript support in Firefox is better than the controls/extensions for disabling PDF scripting.
And Gemini is right there: for the most part it's actually working today. So I just don't get it. Why pick a technology that's tangibly worse than the web on (and I mean this quite literally) almost every single axis and every single metric, when you could instead switch to a markup language that actually does have use-cases, that does simplify deployment and blogging in some instances, that does have a real community, that does have some real advantages over HTML, that does have some real momentum behind it, and that doesn't disrespect my choices about what fonts/images I want to download?

Long sympathetic with the Jacob Nielsen / PDF bad camp ... I've had some recent changes of heart. Not a full convert, but PDF is often superior to HTML, especially for longer-form and complex noninteractive content.
Books are an artefact whose design has evolved over the centuries to accommodate human-scale ergonomics: font size, paper and ink colour, words per line, lines per page, pages per volume, overall weight and dimensions. Standard-sized books are all larger than the largest current mobile phones, with diagonal measures of about 9--12 inches. There are smaller and larger books, but those are compromises either to portability (pocketbooks) or to large-format resolution and detail ("coffee table" books, atlases, and the like). Magazines tend to run even larger (about 13"), broadsheet newspapers larger yet. Most criticisms of PDFs are actually criticisms of the devices and displays used to read them.
Poor resolution, incorrect aspect ratios, and small display sizes (especially mobile devices) are the key problems.
Reading PDFs on a tablet, especially a larger e-ink device, is a game-changer. I now actively avoid HTML, or at least launch it in a browser designed with e-ink in mind (EInkBro: https://github.com/plateaukao/browser). Otherwise, my large (13.3") high-DPI (200+) B&W ebook reader is an excellent long-form immersive reading tool.
The key requirement of a mobile phone is that it fit in a pocket, handbag, or purse. They are too small for reading, and aren't designed for that purpose. Current devices feature screen sizes of roughly 5--7 inches (diagonal measurement). At the lower end, that's smaller than a 3x5 index card (6"), and the largest barely the size of a 4x6 card (7").
On desktops, the first display that offered what I felt was a truly comfortable two-pages-up PDF reading experience was the 27" Retina iMac. Its 5K display (itself an oddball size) suits document work well. Even not fully maximised, most books are highly readable (leaving screen space for other tasks), and at full maximisation, details really stand out especially from scans of historical editions. (Such details aren't always relevent, but often are.)
PDF also provides capabilities HTML either cannot or does not by default (and few seem to be persuaded to offer), especially pagination, formulae, and a spatially-persistent layout (if you have a spatial memory, this is very valuable).
PDFs can though often do not include internal navigation (chapters, sections, etc.), search (if full text is included), and most critically, metadata (at a minimum, author, title, date, and publisher, see the full Dublin Core metadata specification for what should be required).
PDFs can also be published directly to device sizes (or to a set of form factors encompassing typical devices), as several others note.
Some of the issues aren't entirely intrinsic, and my feeling is that wider use of PDFs for online content would lead to a proliferation of PDF annoyances to match present-day Web annoyances. In each case, the fundamental problem is that publishers rather than readers have final say over presentation. An alternative, of distributing raw minimum markup and formatting that to user specifications following a set number of templates ... might help.
It's ironic that the article here embodies a number of PDF annoyances:
- The shaded background renders quite poorly on a B&W e-ink reader (though can be eliminated with a watermark-removal setting).
- The filename provides no clues as to contents or provenance, and is likely to collide with other content.
- I'm a fan of serif fonts, not sans serif, for high-DPI reading.
- Internal and external hyperlink support is ... variable. At times utterly missing, at others, inconsistent or inconvenient.
- PDFs are not trivially directly editable, which means both authors and readers can change errors or address issues.
- Many PDFs lack internal structure, even where the document they encompass do. The number of books lacking PDF table-of-contents support is ... large.
- Metadata standards and practices are abysmal. See the Dublin Core standards.
- Naming conventions similarly. "Report", "Resume", "Project", or "0.pdf" are names which should never be used. Describe author, content, and date, as a minimum, if possible.

This sounds like the Creative Director I worked with, ca. 1998, who bemoaned that he couldn't have pixel-perfect layouts over a wide variety of devices/browsers/operating systems.

the url should end like /Deurbanising-the-Web.pdf so that hitting the safe button doesn't name the file document.pdf or 0.pdf

Cut off your nose to spite your audience.
PDF is meant for viewing and printing books. It's not very good for browsing and requires PDF viewers. All of the browser add-ons, functionality, and behaviors are lost by forcing people to use a PDF viewer.
HTML is meant primarily for browsing but it can also be used for print media. CSS can specify paper sizes. If someone were so worried about external media, they can host it themselves or roll their own CDN. If they were so worried about fonts, they can include them themselves.
It's more semantic web-compatible to describe a website with RDF and have PDF, EPUB, DJVU, MOBI, TXT, PS, etc. links there and also in the webpage. This is how you provide the most accessibility. Furthermore, using a meta document language like LaTeX or something XML that can transform into other document artifact forms mechanically is the way to go.

I just opened your website on mobile and it's very user friendly, I got to scroll in many directions to read the content.
We build our own website with gatsby and only use js if it's really needed (when you click interactive links, we're still trying to improve a bit. We customized Gatsby because doesn't support this out of the box) that gets 100 score on mobile on Google page speed: https://marxcommunications.com/

[[Whodunitfirst (iOS 15)]]
[[My iPad Setup(httpsnipunbatra.github.ioblogsetup20210614setup-ipad.html)]]

[[Caveats and Story]] 


[[The Hardware]]


[[Setting up an iPad for programming]]
        email = MY EMAIL ID
        name = MY NAME
        identityFile =  id_rsa 
```

Now, I was almost done!

I was able to push and pull from some old Github repositories but the same did not work with the newer repositories. Again, after a discussion with the creator of a-shell, I figured, this was due to the fact that Github changed the name of the default branch as "main" instead of the earlier "master" whereas libgit2 implementation was expecting "master".

As a quickfix I renamed the branch on my Github repo as "master" and for now set the default branch to be named "master".

Finally, I am able to pull and push to the repositories. The next image infact is showing commits and pushes made to the repository generating the blog post you are reading. 


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/libgit-2.png "libgit2 push and commiting")

### SSH/SFTP

There are a couple of amazing apps: Termius and SecureShell. Both have very neat interfaces. I found the intergrations with the Files app very good!

The GIF below shows the SecureShell app in action where I transfer a file from my local storage (iPad) to remote server, process that file, and quickly copy the processed file back to local storage. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/SecureShell.gif "Working with SecureShell is amazing!")

Another great functionality of the SecureShell is the "Offline" folder. 

Another setting that I use is the Powerline fonts on my remote systems. Using Fontcase, I installed the corresponding powerline fonts on the iPad so that my SecureShell session looks great.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/powerline-combined.png "Powerline fonts installed via Fontcase allow special characters on the remote terminalls (above image without powerline font on iPad, below one with powerline font")



### Some other amazing tools

I like the "view" utility in a-shell a lot. It can quickly help you preview various filetypes.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/view.gif "The view utility in a-shell")

Also, as a quick tip, one can use Command + W to quickly exit the preview and use the back and forward keys to cycle through the files. This is very useful!

I also like the fact that the `convert` tool now comes in inbuilt. It can convert between a variety of formats easily. 

`pbcopy` and `pbpaste` are very convenient utilities to copy to and from the clipboard. Here is how I copied the content of factorial.py into the clipboard.

```bash
pbcopy < factorial.py  
```

### Shortcuts

a-Shell interfaces nicely with Shortcuts. The following gif shows an interface where I take an input from Shortcuts app -> Pass it to a Python script and execute it inside a-shell -> Store the results in a text file -> View the content of the text file in Shortcuts.


![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/shortcuts.gif "Using shortcuts in a-shell with Python!")

The link to this shortcut is [here](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/a04946a553df4e9790b2c352c5663b0a)

The following is the simple Python script I used called factorial.py

```python
import math
import sys

num = int(sys.argv[1])
print(f"The factorial of {num} is {math.factorial(num)}")
```

The following is an image of the shortcut. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Shortcut-Working.png "Using shortcuts in a-shell with Python!")

Based on the suggestion [here](https://github.com/holzschu/a-shell/issues/74#issuecomment-861416673), I used pbcopy to copy the content to the clipboard and use it directly. It reduces the number of lines! 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/Shortcut-2.png "More efficient version using clipboard")

## Using the WorkingCopy App

WorkingCopy is a very nicely made Git app on the iPad. It is one of the best made apps I have used!

I'll let the pictures do the talking.

## Editors

I use one of the following for editing:

* Koder App
* WorkingCopy App
* vim (in a-Shell)
* Textastic
* Typewriter for Markdown — is an editor only for markdown but gives a nice quick preview. The image below shows the screenshot from Typewriter for Markdown app.

  1. Various browsing needs

  3. Support of similar decentralized platforms

Mastodon has followed a similar approach to Twitter that offers customized listing views. Furthermore Mastodon’s API as well as its official web client offers much more freedom to define customized way of filtering a timeline, such as based on certain saved hashtags, excluding fediverse, etc. There is no motivation from my perspective to provide a “main timeline” where like Twitter that personalized feed as well as inserting advertisements, still, what kind of structure and interaction pattern that can support such highly dynamic need will be explored after version 1.0.

Stay tuned!

Sorta petty I suppose but I finally finished this process - precisely 31 days later lol - and wow! Definitely an illuminating/educational experience. So much so , in fact, that I would absolutely recommend anyone wanting a better familiarity with how Actions work do what I did - create an Action Group just to collect your favorite TAD actions you’ve come across. Even if keyboard shortcuts aren’t involved.

# Use Magic Keyboard with iPhone | iPhone User Guide 
You can use Magic Keyboard, including Magic Keyboard with Numeric Keypad, to enter text on iPhone. Magic Keyboard connects to iPhone using Bluetooth and is powered by a built-in rechargeable battery. (Magic Keyboard is sold separately.)

_Note_: For compatibility information about Apple Wireless Keyboard and third-party Bluetooth keyboards, see the Apple Support article [Apple Wireless Keyboard and Magic Keyboard compatibility with iOS devices](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202041).

***
### Pair Magic Keyboard to iPhone
1. Make sure the keyboard is turned on and charged.
2. On iPhone, go to Settings ⚙︎ > Bluetooth, then turn on Bluetooth.
3. Select the device when it appears in the Other Devices ßlist.

_Note_: If Magic Keyboard is already paired with another device, you must unpair them before you can connect Magic Keyboard to your iPhone. For iPhone, iPad, or iPod touch, see [Unpair a Bluetooth device](ibooks://1515995528/iph6e757db44.xhtml#iph8f62615e0). On Mac, choose Apple menu  > System Preferences > Bluetooth, select the device, then Control-click its name.
***

### Reconnect Magic Keyboard to iPhone
Magic Keyboard disconnects when you turn its switch to Off or when you move it or iPhone out of Bluetooth range—about 33 feet (10 meters).

To reconnect, turn the keyboard switch to On, or bring the keyboard and iPhone back into range, then tap any key.

When Magic Keyboard is reconnected, the onscreen keyboard doesn’t appear.

***
### Switch to the onscreen keyboard
You need to use the onscreen keyboard instead of an external keyboard to do things like type accented characters or use dictation.

To show the onscreen keyboard, press ⏏︎ on the external keyboard. To hide the onscreen keyboard, press ⏏︎ again.

***
### Switch between language and emoji keyboards
1. On Magic Keyboard, press and hold the Control key.
2. Press the Space bar to cycle between English, emoji, and [any keyboards you added for typing in different languages](ibooks://1515995528/iph3c511601.xhtml#iph73b71eb).

***
### Open Search using Magic Keyboard
Press Command-Space.

***
### Change typing options for Magic Keyboard
You can change how iPhone automatically responds to your typing on an external keyboard.

Go to Settings ⚙︎ > General > Keyboard > Hardware Keyboard, then do any of the following:

* _Assign an alternative keyboard layout_: Tap a language at the top of the screen, then choose an alternative layout from the list. (An alternative keyboard layout that doesn’t match the keys on your external keyboard.)
* _Turn Auto-Capitalization on or off_: When this option is selected, an app supporting this feature capitalizes proper nouns and the first words in sentences as you type.
* _Turn Auto-Correction on or off_: When this option is selected, an app supporting this feature corrects the spelling as you type.
* _Turn “.” Shortcut on or off_: When this option is selected, double-tapping the space bar inserts a period followed by a space.
* _Change the action performed by the Command key or other modifier key_: Tap Modifier Keys, tap a key, then choose the action you want it to perform.

## Retrieves show notes from currently-playing episode in Overcast, converts them to Markdown, stashes the result in Bear.

## About
This Shortcut was originally inspired by [@mralexhay‘s original](https://routinehub.co/shortcut/2343/) - which notably did not require Toolbox Pro, but is no longer functioning correctly.

It captures the show notes in HTML from the currently-playing episode in Overcast, converts the HTML to Rich Text, converts said Rich Text to Markdown, and stashes the result in a new Bear note.

# Music Streaming Services with Makers and Curators 

I’d really love to host a chat with musicians about streaming services today. I suppose #TwitterSpaces is my only option. http://bit.ly/twdbstreaming

 https://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=5687&iso=20210407T14&msg=Music%20Streaming%20Services%20with%20Makers%20and%20Curators%20%28Twitter%20Space%29

Musicians! Curators! People who "like music!"
I've heard from just about everybody but you on #Spotify, #AppleMusic, #Tidal, etc... and I wanna know what YOU have to say about music streaming. #TwitterSpaces

[[Personal MacOS Keyboard Shortcuts Configuration]]

Adding a new feature to a product is always a tradeoff. Will the added utility of a new feature be enough to offset the added complexity? Shortcuts would seem to side-step this issue—after all, they're simply a quicker alternative for features already in your app. But that creates another dilemma: what if a new feature is added and no one knows it's there?

When key commands for external keyboards debuted in iOS 7, there was no intrinsic way to learn of their existence. Unlike in OS X, where a user can gradually discover shortcuts for the menu items they use most often, an iOS app had few ways to communicate what key commands are available. Initial tours flash by and fade from memory; help screens are hidden out of sight. Without a way to make shortcuts visible in a timely and relevant manner, users were sure to miss out on useful features that developers had taken the time to implement.

No longer. As part of the push for greater productivity on the iPad, iOS 9 adds *Discoverability*, an overlay showing the currently available key commands inside an app. This small change suddenly makes key commands far more viable on the iPad and, with it, makes `UIKeyCommand` a necessary addition to your app.

---

## `UIKeyCommand`

The `UIKeyCommand` class is in fact quite simple, with only four properties to configure:

- `input`: The character of the key you'd like to recognize, or the correct constant for the arrow and escape keys, which do not have characters themselves. The available constants are:
    - `UIKeyInputUpArrow`
    - `UIKeyInputDownArrow`
    - `UIKeyInputLeftArrow`
    - `UIKeyInputRightArrow`
    - `UIKeyInputEscape`

- `modifierFlags`: One or more `UIKeyModifierFlags`, describing the modifier keys that should be pressed in combination with `input`:
    - `.Command`, `.Alternate`, `.Shift`, `.Control`: The Command, Option, Shift, and Control keys, respectively.
    - `.NumericPad`: Indicates that `input` should come from the numeric keypad rather than the top row of the standard keyboard.
    - `.AlphaShift`: Indicates that the CapsLock key should be *pressed* as part of the combination, rather than just engaged.

- `action`: The selector to call when the key command is invoked, called with a `UIKeyCommand` as its only argument. The key event will travel up the responder chain until a matching selector is found.

- `discoverabilityTitle` *(iOS 9 only)*: An optional label to display for the key command in the Discoverability layover. Only key commands with a title set will be listed.




## Responding to Key Commands

Enabling key commands is as simple as providing an array of `UIKeyCommand` instances somewhere in the responder chain. Text inputs are automatically first responders, but perhaps more usefully, a view controller can respond to key commands by implementing `canBecomeFirstResponder()`:

```swift
override func canBecomeFirstResponder() -> Bool {
    return true
}
```
```objc
- (BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder {
    return YES;
}
```

Next, provide a list of available key commands via the `keyCommands` property:

```swift
override var keyCommands: [UIKeyCommand]? {
    return [
        UIKeyCommand(input: "1", modifierFlags: .Command, action: "selectTab:", discoverabilityTitle: "Types"),
        UIKeyCommand(input: "2", modifierFlags: .Command, action: "selectTab:", discoverabilityTitle: "Protocols"),
        UIKeyCommand(input: "3", modifierFlags: .Command, action: "selectTab:", discoverabilityTitle: "Functions"),
        UIKeyCommand(input: "4", modifierFlags: .Command, action: "selectTab:", discoverabilityTitle: "Operators"),
            
        UIKeyCommand(input: "f", modifierFlags: [.Command, .Alternate], action: "search:", discoverabilityTitle: "Find…"),
    ]
}

<#...#>

func selectTab(sender: UIKeyCommand) {
    let selectedTab = sender.input
    <#...#>
}
```
```objc
- (NSArray<UIKeyCommand *>*)keyCommands {
    return @[
        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"1" modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand action:@selector(selectTab:) discoverabilityTitle:@"Types"],
        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"2" modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand action:@selector(selectTab:) discoverabilityTitle:@"Protocols"],
        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"3" modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand action:@selector(selectTab:) discoverabilityTitle:@"Functions"],
        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"4" modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand action:@selector(selectTab:) discoverabilityTitle:@"Operators"],

        [UIKeyCommand keyCommandWithInput:@"f" 
                            modifierFlags:UIKeyModifierCommand | UIKeyModifierAlternate 
                                   action:@selector(search:) 
                     discoverabilityTitle:@"Find…"]
    ];
}

<#...#>

- (void)selectTab:(UIKeyCommand *)sender {
    NSString *selectedTab = sender.input;
    <#...#>
}
```

In the Discoverability layover, accessed by holding down the Command key, key commands are listed in the order you specified:

![Discoverability Layover]({% asset uikeycommand-discoverability.png @path %})

*Voila!* Secrets, revealed!


### Context Sensitivity

The `keyCommands` property is accessed whenever a key pressed, making it possible to provide context-sensitive responses depending on the state of your application. While this is similar to the way a menu item and its active/inactive state are configured in OS X, the recommendation for iOS is to omit inactive commands completely—that is, there are no grayed out commands in the Discoverability layover.

Here, a set of commands that are available to logged in users of an app are included only when appropriate:

```swift
let globalKeyCommands = [UIKeyCommand(input:...), ...]
let loggedInUserKeyCommands = [UIKeyCommand(input:...), ...]

override var keyCommands: [UIKeyCommand]? {
    if isLoggedInUser() {
        return globalKeyCommands + loggedInUserKeyCommands
    } else {
        return globalKeyCommands
    }
}
```

Although we don't take shortcuts when creating our apps, that doesn't mean our users won't find shortcuts useful. Adding key commands lets control of your app shift from the screen to the keyboard—your users will love the option.

# Comparison of syntax extensions in Markdown flavors 

I created a crude comparison of the syntax of the various common Markdown extensions to have a better view on what are the most common extensions and what is the most widely accepted syntax for them.
