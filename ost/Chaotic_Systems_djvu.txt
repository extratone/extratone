Preface 



This book represents a collection of major developments in the area of Chaotic Systems. 
Researchers from around the world summarize key guidelines on modeling, simula- 
tion, control synchronization, and applications of these systems. The organization of 
the book includes twelve chapters covering a wide variety of engineering areas regard- 
ing basic scientific research and technological development. 

The first chapter presents a time series technique to forecast future events. The sec- 
ond chapter analyzes forecasting chaos, providing a deep insight on the meaning of 
Lyapunov exponents locally. The predictability of chaotic events considering initial 
error in chaotic systems is presented in chapter three. The fourth chapter introduces a 
microscopic theory of transport phenomena which is supported by applying Hamilto- 
nian forms. These four chapters motivate the reader to look for approaches to control 
and synchronization of chaotic systems. Furthermore, chapters five, six and seven 
focus on controlling the chaos phenomenon. For instance, micro-electromechanical 
systems like resonators might present chaotic behavior, the prediction and control of 
chaos is then presented in chapter five. Chaotic systems can be perturbed, and control 
and identification approaches can be applied as shown in chapter six. Among all tech- 
niques for controlling chaos the adaptive one is very useful, as described in chapter 
seven. Chaos systems can be synchronized as shown in chapters eight and nine. In 
chapter nine a technique for chaos control called feedback control, is also presented. 
Some realizations of chaotic oscillators with electronic circuits are presented in chap- 
ter ten. In this chapter two chaos systems are synchronized by Hamiltonian forms 
and observer approach, to realize a secure communication system. Chapter eleven 
introduces estimation techniques for chaos systems to develop digital communica- 
tions. Some open research problems can be identified in these eleven chapters, as well 
as in the final chapter devoted to the emergence of matured chaos during network 
growth. 

This book includes recent advances in science and engineering applications. However, 
as highlighted in the majority of chapters, still many research and applications are 
very much in need of further development. In this way, the book is a good source for 
identifying basics on chaotic systems, techniques to control and synchronize them, 
and to acquire recent knowledge and ideas for future research in this area. Some ap- 
plications to engineering motivate the reader to develop experiments applied to real

life problems. This book is intended for students, academia and industry since the col- 
lected chapters provide a rich cocktail while balancing theory and applications. 

Enjoy the book!

1. Introduction 

The neural network was initiated by McCulloch and Pitts (1943), who claimed that neurons 
with binary inputs and a step-threshold activation function were analogous to first order 
systems. Hebb (1949) revolutionized the perception of artificial neurons. Rosenblatt (1958), 
using the McCulloch-Pitts neuron and the findings of Hebb, developed the first perception 
model of the neuron, which is still widely accepted today. Hopfield (1982) and Hopfield et al. 
(1983) demonstrated from work on the neuronal structure of the common garden slug that 
ANNs (artificial neural networks) can solve non-separable problems by placing a hidden layer 
between the input and output layers. Rumelhart and McClelland (1986) developed the most 
famous learning algorithm in ANN-backpropagation, which used a gradient descent 
technique to propagate error through a network to adjust the weights in an attempt to find the 
global error minimum, marking a milestone in the current artificial neural networks. Since 
then, a huge proliferation in the ANN methodologies has come about. 

Many physical systems in the real world, such as rainfall systems (Hense, 1987), chemical 
reactions (Argoul et al., 1987), biological systems (Glass et al., 1983) and traffic flow systems 
(Dendrinos, 1994), have complicated dynamical behaviors and their mathematical models are 
usually difficult to derive. If the system has only one measurement available, to obtain 
knowledge about its dynamical behaviors, one usual method is to reconstruct the state space by 
using delay coordinates: {x(t), x(t-r), x(t-2r),..., x(t-(q-l)r)}, where x(f) is time series of the 
measurement, a is the dimension of the reconstructed state space and ris the time delay (Moon, 
1992; Alligood et al., 1997). By gradually increasing the dimension of the state space, the fractal 
dimension of the chaotic attractor (Moon, 1992; Grassberger and Proccacia, 1983) will approach 
an asymptote. This asymptote is often considered to be the chaotic attractor dimension of the 
dynamical system. According to Takens (1981), the embedding dimension of the chaotic 
attractor, or the dimension required to reconstruct the state space, must be at least twice larger 
than the chaotic attractor dimension so that the generic delay plots could be obtained. 
That chaotic behaviors exist in the traffic flow system has been known for decades. Gazis et 
al. (1961) developed a generalized car-following model, known as the GHR (Gazis-Herman- 
Rothery) model, whose discontinuous behavior and nonlinearity suggested chaotic 
solutions for a certain range of input parameters. Traffic systems without signals, 
bottlenecks, intersections, etc. or with a coordinate signal network, modeled by the 
traditional GHR traffic-flow equation, were tested for presence of chaotic behaviors (Disbro 
and Frame, 1989; Fu et al., 2005). Chaos was also observed in a platoon of vehicles described 
by the traditional GHR model with a nonlinear inter-vehicle separation dependent term 
added (Addison and Low, 1996). 



Chaotic Systems 



Up to the present, there have been a variety of methodologies devoted to short-term chaotic 
time series prediction, including local linear models (Farmer and Sidorowich, 1987), 
polynomial models (Acquirre and Billings, 1994) and neural network-based black-box models 
(Principe et al, 1992; Albano et al., 1992; Deco and Schurmann, 1994; Bakker et al., 1996), just to 
name a few. However, this chapter will only focus on two easy-to-implement methods: (i) the 
feedforward backpropagation neural network and (ii) the multiple linear regression. 

2. Embedding dimension 

To get the right dimension of the reconstructed state space to embed the attractor (chaotic or 
periodic), the dimension of the attractor must first be found. There are a number of ways to 
measure the attractor dimension (Moon, 1992; Grassberger and Proccacia, 1983). Among 
them, this chapter only demonstrates two measures easily processed with the aid of the 
computer: (i) the pointwise dimension; (ii) the correlation dimension. 

2.1 Pointwise dimension 

A long-time trajectory in the state space is considered, as shown in Fig. 1, where a sphere of 
radius r is placed at some point on the orbit. The probability of finding a point inside the 
sphere is (Moon, 1992) 

iv 

where N(r^) is the number of points within the sphere and No the total number of points in 
the orbit. When the radius r becomes smaller, and Noâ*â¢, there exists a relationship between 
In P(r) and In r, which can be expressed as (Moon, 1992): 



lnP(r) 

i â 

*o lnr 



d p =\im^-^ (2) 



In order to have better results, the averaged pointwise dimension is usually used; that is 

ln[(l/M)!P(r)] 

dp = llm , i ( \ (3) 

r->0 m(r) 

where M is the number of randomly selected points on the orbit. In practice, M is 
approximately one tenth of the total number of points on the orbit. 

2.2 Correlation dimension 

As in the definition of pointwise dimension, the orbit is discretized to a set of points in the 
state space. A sphere of radius r is first placed at each and every point of the orbit and then 
the Euclidean distances between pairs of points are calculated. A correlation function is 
defined as (Moon, 1992; Grassberger and Proccacia, 1983)

where x, -x is the Euclidean distance between points Xi and Xj of the orbit and u is the 
unit step function. For a lot of attractors, this function C(r) exhibits a power law dependence 
on r, as r-^0; that is 



limC(r) = or 
Based on the above relationship, a correlation dimension is defined by the expression 



= lim 



lnC(r)

(6) 



The dimension of the attractor found by Eq. (3) or (6) will approach an asymptote d with the 
conjectured dimension of the reconstructed state space gradually increasing. To represent 
the attractor one to one without causing self-intersection, the embedding dimension of the 
attractor must be at least 2d+l (Takens, 1981). For a chaotic attractor, the dimension d is 
always fractal, not an integer. Therefore, the appropriate dimension for the reconstructed 
state space will be the smallest integer greater than or equal to 2d+l. 

3. Forecasting models 

3.1 Neural networks 

The first forecasting model introduced in this chapter is a two-layer feedforward neural 
network with the backpropagation training algorithm, as shown in Fig. 2. The transfer 
function used in the single hidden layer is the tan-sigmoid function for mapping the input to 
the interval [-1, 1] of the following form 



-/(Â«,) = 



i = l,2,3,...,s 



(7) 



where m=waXi+ 1012X2+. . -+w irXr+ bi, Xi, X2,. . -,xr are the inputs, s is the number of neurons, Wa 
, Wi2 ,..., WiR are the weights connecting the input vector and the rth neuron of the hidden 
layer, and &, is its bias. The output layer with a single neuron uses the linear transfer 
function

a = f(n) = n 



(8) 



where n=WnHi + Wj2(i2 + +Wj s a s + b, Wn,Wu,- â  -M^is are the weights connecting the neurons 

of the hidden layer and the neuron of the output layer, and b is the bias of the output 
neuron.

Output Layer

There are many variations of the backpropagation algorithm, which is aimed at minimizing 
the network performance function, i.e., the mean square error between the network outputs 
and the target outputs, which is 



MSE= â Â£ (f,-Â«/) 2 

m j=l 



(9) 



where tj and a ; are the jth target output and network output, respectively. The Levenberg- 
Marquardt algorithm (Hagan and Menhaj, 1994; Levenberg, 1944; Marquardt, 1963) is 
selected as the training function to minimize the network performance function. This 
algorithm interpolates between the Newton's algorithm and the gradient descent method. If 
a tentative step increases the performance function, this algorithm will act like the gradient 
descent method, while it shifts toward Newton's method if the reduction of the performance 
function is successful. In this way, the performance function will always be reduced at each 
iteration of the algorithm. To make the neural networks more efficient, it is quite beneficial 
to scale inputs and targets so that they will fall within a specific range. For example, the 
following formula 



fc' = 2( k - mU \ )-l 



max - mm 



(10) 



is often used to scale both inputs and targets, where k is the original value, A: 'is the scaled 
value, and max and mitt are the maximum and minimum of the inputs or targets, 



Short-Term Chaotic Time Series Forecast 



respectively. Eq. (10) produces inputs and targets in the range [-1, 1]; the scaled outputs of 
the trained networks will be usually converted back to the original units. 
There are two methods to improve the network generalization: Bayesian regularization 
(MacKay, 1992) and early stopping. The Bayesian regularization provides a measure of how 
many network parameters (weights and biases) are being effectively used by the network. 
From this effective number of parameters, the number of neurons required in the hidden 
layer of the two-layer neural network can be derived by the following equation 

(Rs+s)+(s+l)= P (11) 

where R is the number of elements in the input vector, s is the number of neurons in the 
hidden layer, and P is the effective number of parameters found by the Bayesian 
regularization. With the strategy of early stopping incorporated into the neural network, the 
error on the validation set is monitored during the training process. When the network 
begins to overfit the training data, the error on the validation set typically also begins to rise. 
Once the validation error increases for a specified number of iterations, the training stops 
and the weights and biases at the minimum of validation error are returned. To evaluate the 
performance of the trained network, the regression analysis between the network outputs 
and the corresponding targets is frequently adopted, and the result is usually displayed by 
the scatter plot or correlation coefficient (Mendenhall et al., 1986). 

3.2 The multiple linear regression 

Because nearby states in the state space have analogous behaviors (Alligood et al. 1997; 
Farmer and Sidorowich, 1987), as shown in Fig. 3, a multiple linear regression model 
(Mendenhall et al., 1986), fitted to the delay coordinates of nearby states in the reconstructed 
state space is another good choice to forecast the short-term behavior of the chaotic 
dynamical system. Assuming that q is the appropriate embedding dimension of the strange 
attractor, the multiple linear regression to predict the future behaviors of a trajectory has the 
following form 

V, =Po + A*;i + faa + â â â  + Pfy, , , , i=l,-.,p (12) 

where i/, is the predicted value of the observed response yâ which corresponds to the first 
delay coordinate of the ith nearest state some time units later, the independent 
variables x n , x, 2 ,...,x, correspond to the delay coordinates of the ith nearest state: {x(t), x(t- 
t), x(t-2r),..., x(t-(q-l)r)}, respectively, p is the total number of data, and Po, Pi, P^--, Pi; are 
unknown parameters to be decided by the method of least squares (Mendenhall et al., 1986).

4. Numerical results 

Examples chosen for demonstration are the westbound passing traffic volume at the 
intersection of Xingai Road and Guanfu S. Road, Taipei City, Taiwan. The data were 
collected by the vehicle traffic counter from August 22, 2005 to September 2, 2005, totaling 
10 weekdays excluding the weekend. There are three time scales involved: 5-min, 10-min, 
and 15-min. 

4.1 Reconstruction of the traffic flow system 

Time series of the three different time intervals show no repeat of themselves and have the 
tendency to be aperiodic. For example, Fig. 4 shows time series of the 5- min traffic volume 
for the training set (first 7 days totaling 2016 observations). The state-space dimension n for 
the delay coordinate reconstruction of the traffic flow system is increased gradually from 3 
to 22. For each reconstruction, both the pointwise dimension and correlation dimension of 
the strange attractor are found for comparison. Fig. 5(a) shows the limiting behavior of the 
function ln|(2P(r)) / Ml as r â > for different state-space dimension n with time delay r 

fixed at 20, and Fig. 5(b) shows the pointwise dimension approaching an asymptote of 6.449. 
Fig. 6(a) shows the limiting behavior of the function lnC(r) as r â > for different state- 
space dimension n with time delay r fixed at 20, and Fig. 6(b) shows the correlation 
dimension approaching an asymptote of 6.427. The results shown in Figs. 5 and 6

are valid only for the 5-min traffic volume and time delay t = 20. The asymptotes of the 
pointwise dimension and correlation dimension for a variety of different time intervals and 
time delays are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, where the limiting dimension of 
the chaotic attractor ranges from 6.307 to 6.462. Different time intervals and time delays lead 
to almost the same fractal dimension. According to Takens (1981), the embedding 
dimension of chaotic attractors of the traffic flow system is therefore found to be at least 14. 
Because different time delays result in almost identical limiting fractal dimension of the 
chaotic attractor, the choice of time delay in fact is actually not decisive, except to avoid the 
natural period of the system.

4.2 Neural networks 

The neural network toolbox of MATLAB (Demuth et al., 2010) software is used to build up 
neural networks and perform the training. The elements of the input vector are composed of 
14-dimensional delay coordinates: x(i), x(i-r), x(i-2t),..., x(i-13r), where x(i) is the ith 
observation of the time series of traffic volume, and r is the time delay, which is chosen to be 
20, 10 and 5 for 5-min, 10-min, and 15-min traffic volumes, respectively. The network target 
corresponding to this input is x(i+l). All forecasts are only one time interval ahead of 
occurrence, i.e., 5-min, 10-min or 15-min ahead of time. When using the strategy "early 
stopping" to monitor the training process, the allowed number of iterations for the 
validation error to increase is set to be 5. The data collected is divided into three sets: the 
training set (the first 7 days), the validation set (the 8 th and 9 th days), and the prediction set 
(the 10* day). 



4.2.1 5-min traffic volume 

First of all, a feedforward backpropogation neural network with the Bayesian regularization 
is creasted to get the effective number of network parameters. The network inputs and 
targets are imported from the 14-dimensional delay coordinates: x(i), x(i-20), x(i-40),..., x(i- 
260), and x(i+l), respectively. The results are shown in Fig. 7, which indicates only 
approximately 216 effective parameters are required in this network; therefore, the 
appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer is found by Eq. (11) to be 14 (equal to the 
number of elements in the input vector). Then, replace the number of neurons in the hidden 
layer with 14 and train the network again by the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm coupled 
with the strategy "early stopping." The training process stops at 10 epochs because the 
validation error already has increased for 5 iterations. Fig. 8 shows the scatter plot for the 
training set with correlation coefficient p=0.90249. Lastly, simulate the trained network with 
the prediction set. Fig. 9 shows the scatter plot for the prediction set with the correlation 
coefficient p=0. 83086. Time series of the observed value (network targets) and the predicted

value (network outputs) are shown in Fig. 10. If the strategy "early stopping" is disregarded 
and 100 epochs is chosen for the training process, the trained network performance indeed 
improves for the training set, but gets worse for the validation and prediction sets. If the 
number of neurons in the hidden layer is increased to 28 and 42, the performance of the 
network for the training set tends to improve, but does not have the tendency to 
significantly improve for the validation and prediction sets, as listed in Table 3.

4.2.2 10-min traffic volume 

The network inputs and targets are the 14-dimensional delay coordinates: x(i), x(i-10), x(i- 
20),..., x(i-130), and x(i+l), respectively. Similarly, by using Bayesian regularization, the 
effective number of parameters is first found to be 108, as shown in Fig. 11; therefore, the 
appropriate number of neurons in the hidden layer is 7 (one half of the number of elements in 
the input vector). Replace the number of neurons in the hidden layer with 7 and train the 
network again. The training process stops at 11 epochs because the validation error has 
increased for 5 iterations. Fig. 12 shows the scatter plot for the training set with correlation 
coefficient p=0. 93874. Simulate the trained network with the prediction set. Fig. 13 shows the 
scatter plot for the prediction set with the correlation coefficient p=0.91976. Time series of the 
observed value (network targets) and the predicted value (network outputs) are shown in Fig. 
14. If the strategy "early stopping" is disregarded and 100 epochs is chosen for the training 
process, the performance of the network improves for the training set, but gets worse for the 
validation and prediction sets. If the number of neurons in the hidden layer is increased to 14 
and 28, the performance of the network for the training set tends to improve, but does not 
have the tendency to improve for the validation and prediction sets, as listed in Table 4.

The network inputs and targets are the 14-dimensional delay coordinates: x(i), x(i-5), x(i-

4.3 The multiple linear regression 

Data collected for the first nine days are used to build the prediction model, and data 
collected for the tenth day to test the prediction model. To forecast the near future behavior 
of a trajectory in the reconstructed 14-dimensional state space with time delay r= 20, the 
number of 200 nearest states of the trajectory, after a few trials, is found appropriate for 
building the multiple linear regression model. Figs. 19-21 show time series of the predicted 
and observed volume for 5-min, 10-min, and 15-min intervals whose correlation coefficients 
p's are 0.850, 0.932 and 0.951, respectively. All forecasts are all one time interval ahead of 
occurrence, i.e., 5-min, 10-min and 15-min ahead of time. These three figures indicate that 
the larger the time interval, the better the performance of the prediction mode. To study the 
effects of the number K of the nearest states on the performance of the prediction model, a 
number of K's are tested for different time intervals. Figs. 22-24 show the limiting behavior 
of the correlation coefficient p for the three time intervals. These three figures reveal that the 
larger the number K, the better the performance of the prediction mode, but after a certain 
number, the correlation coefficient p does not increase significantly. 



5. Conclusions 

Numerical experiments have shown the effectiveness of the techniques introduced in this 
chapter to predict short-term chaotic time series. The dimension of the chaotic attractor in the 
delay plot increases with the dimension of the reconstructed state space and finally reaches an 
asymptote, which is fractal. A number of time delays have been tried to find the limiting 
dimension of the chaotic attractor, and the results are almost identical, which indicates the 
choice of time delay is not decisive, when the state space of the chaotic time series is being 
reconstructed. The effective number of neurons in the hidden layer of neural networks can be 
derived with the aid of the Bayesian regularization instead of using the trial and error.

Using neurons in the hidden layer more than the number decided by the Bayesian 
regularization can indeed improve the performance of neural networks for the training set, 
but does not necessarily better the performance for the validation and prediction sets. 
Although disregarding the strategy "early stopping" can improve the network performance 
for the training set, it causes worse performance for the validation and prediction sets. 
Increasing the number of nearest states to fit the multiple linear regression forecast model 
can indeed enhance the performance of the prediction, but after the nearest states reach a 
certain number, the performance does not improve significantly. Numerical results from 
these two forecast models also show that the multiple linear regression is superior to neural 
networks, as far as the prediction accuracy is concerned. In addition, the longer the traffic 
volume scales are, the better the prediction of the traffic flow becomes.

1. Introduction 

When taking a deterministic approach to predicting the future of a system, the main premise 
is that future states can be fully inferred from the current state. Hence, deterministic systems 
should in principle be easy to predict. Yet, some systems can be difficult to forecast accurately: 
such chaotic systems are extremely sensitive to initial conditions, so that a slight deviation 
from a trajectory in the state space can lead to dramatic changes in future behavior. 
We propose a novel methodology for forecasting deterministic systems using information on 
the local chaoticity of the system via the so-called local Lyapunov exponent (LLE). To the 
best of our knowledge, while several works exist on the forecasting of chaotic systems (see, 
e.g., Murray, 1993; and Doerner et al, 1991) as well as on LLEs (e.g., Abarbanel, 1992; Wolff, 
1992; Eckhardt & Yao, Bailey, 1997), none exploit the information contained in the LLE to 
forecasting. The general intuition behind our methodology can be viewed as a complement 
to existing forecasting methods, and can be extended to chaotic time series. 
In this chapter, we start by illustrating the fact that chaoticity generally is not uniform on 
the orbit of a chaotic system, and that it may have considerable consequences in terms of 
the prediction accuracy of existing methods. For illustrative purposes, we describe how 
our methodology can be used to improve upon the well-known nearest-neighbor predictor 
on three deterministic systems: the Rossler, Lorenz and Chua attractors. We analyse the 
sensitivity of our methodology to changes in the prediction horizon and in the number of 
neighbors considered, and compare it to that of the nearest-neighbor predictor. 
The nearest-neighbor predictor has proved to be a simple yet useful tool for forecasting chaotic 
systems (see Farmer & Sidorowich, 1987). In the case of a one-neighbor predictor, it takes the 
observation in the past which most resembles today's state and returns that observation's 
successor as a predictor of tomorrow's state. The rationale behind the nearest-neighbor 
predictor is quite simple: given that the system is assumed to be deterministic and ergodic, 
one obtains a sensible prediction of the variable's future by looking back at its evolution from 
a similar, past situation. For predictions more than one step ahead, the procedure is iterated 
by successively merging the predicted values with the observed data. 



26 Chaotic Systems 

The nearest-neighbor predictor performs reasonably well in the short run (Ziehmann et al, 
2000; Guegan, 2003). Nevertheless, by construction it can never produce an exact prediction 
because the nearest neighbor on which predictions are based can never exactly coincide with 
today's state â or else the underlying process, being deterministic, would also be periodic 
and trivially predicted. The same argument applies to other non-parametric predictors, like 
kernel methods, radial functions, etc. (see, e.g., Shintani & Linton, 2004; Guegan & Mercier, 
1998). Hence, we argue that these predictors can be improved upon by correcting this inherent 
shortcoming. 

Our methodology aims at correcting the above shortcoming by incorporating information 
carried by the system's LLE into the prediction. The methodology yields two possible 
candidates, potentially leading to significant improvements over the nearest neighbor 
predictor, provided one manages to solve the selection problem, which is an issue we address 
here. We develop a systematic method for solving the candidate selection problem and show, 
on three known chaotic systems, that it yields statisfactory results (close to a 100% success rate 
in selecting the "right" candidate). 

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we present our methodology on 
the use of LLEs in forecasting and introduce the candidate selection problem. In Section 3, 
we solve the selection problem and show using simulated chaotic systems that the size of the 
LLEs plays no role in the optimality of the selection procedure. However, the size of the LLEs 
does matter for the success rate of our selection algorithm and has an impact on the size of 
errors. These findings, as well as the sensitivity analysis of our methodology to the prediciton 
horizon and the number of neighbors, are presented in Section 4. Section 5 concludes. 

2. Chaoticity depends on where you are 

Consider a one-dimensional series of T observations from a chaotic system, {x\, --Xj), whose 
future values we wish to forecast. Here, we consider that a chaotic system is characterized 
by the existence of an attractor in a d-dimensional phase space (Eckmann & Ruelle, 1985), 
where d > 1 is the embedding dimension. A possible embedding method involves building 
a d-dimensional orbit, (Xj), with Xf = (xf,Xf_ T , ...,x f _M -n T ). For the sake of exposition, we 
shall assume T = 1 in the remainder of the paper. 

By definition, the local Lyapunov exponent (LLE) of a dynamical system characterizes the rate 
of separation of points infinitesimally close on an orbit. Formally, two neighboring points in 
phase space with initial separation SXq are separated, t periods later, by the distance: 

5X = SX e Aot , 

where Aq is the (largest) LLE of the system in the vicinity of the initial points. Typically, this 
local rate of divergence (or convergence, if Aq < 0) depends on the orientation of the initial 
vector SXq. Thus, strictly speaking, a whole spectrum of local Lyapunov exponents exists, one 
per dimension of the state space. A dynamic system is considered to be (locally) chaotic if 
A > 0, and (locally) stable if A < 0. (see, e.g., Bailey, 1997) 

We develop a methodology which exploits the local information carried by the LLE to improve 
upon existing methods of reconstruction and prediction. Our methodology utilizes the 



1 The choice of the embedding dimension has been the object of much work (see Takens, 1996, for a 
survey) and is beyond the scope of this work.

(estimated) value of the LLE to measure the intrinsic prediction error of existing predictors 
and corrects these predictors accordingly. Note that this methodology applies regardless of 
the sign of A,; i.e., regardless of whether the system is locally chaotic or locally stable. The 
only drawback of our approach is that it generates two candidate predictions, denoted Aj 
and Xj, one being an excellent predictor (which improves upon existing methods) and the 
other being rather poor. For instance, when applied to the nearest-neighbor predictor, the 
candidates are the two solutions to the equation: 

(2 - x l+l ) 2 + (x T - Xif + ... + (x T _ d+2 - x,_ d+2 ) 2 - |X T - X,| V A < = 0, (1) 

where X, is the phase-space nearest neighbor of the last observation, Xj. A; is estimated by A, 
using the method developed in Wolff (1992). 34 

Hence, accurate prediction boils down to being able to select the better of the two candidate 
predictors. Our goal here is to improve on previous work in Guegan & Leroux (2009a, 
2009b) by developing a systematic selection method to accurately select the best of the two 
candidates, Xj and Xj. To do so, we further exploit the information conveyed by the LLE. 
Indeed, the LLE being a measure of local chaoticity of a system (Abarbanel, 1992; Wolff, 1992), 
it may also yield important clues regarding the regularity of the trajectory. 
In fact, even "globally chaotic" systems are typically made up of both "chaotic regions", where 
the LLE is positive, and more stable regions where it is negative (Bailey, 1997), as we illustrate 
in Figures 1, 2 and 3 for the Rossler 5 , the Lorenz 6 , and the Chua 7 systems, respectively 8 . In 
each figure we display, clockwise from the upper left corner: the 3-dimensional attractor in 
the (x, y, z)-space, the value of the LLE along the orbit (A is displayed on the vertical axis), the 
value of the LLE along the trajectory, and the distribution of LLE values ranked from highest 



3 Other estimations of Lyapunov exponents exist. See, e.g., Gengay (1996), Delecroix et al (1997) and Bask 
& Gencay (1998).

to lowest. Notice that for each attractor, the value of the LLE takes on positive and negative 
values (i.e., above and below the A = plane depicted in the upper-right corner). Hence, we 
may expect very stable trajectories where the LLE is small, wheras regions where the LLE is 
large yield highly unstable behavior.

3. Solving the selection problem 



Assuming that we observe X\, ...,if, and following the insights of the previous section, we 
now investigate conditioning our selection process on the value of the LLE. Formally, our 
algorithm can be defined as follows: 



If \j < A, select the "colinear" candidate 
otherwise, select the "non colinear" candidate, 



(2) 



where A is an exogenously given threshold value. We abuse terminology slightly and denote 
by "colinear" the candidate which maximizes the following scalar product: 



X 



â¢j, +1 = arg max 

Xt+iGC ||a t+ i -X t 



(X r+1 - X T ) â  (X i+1 - X T ) 
x||X, +1 -X T | 



(3) 



where C = {(x T+1 ,Xj, â¢ â¢â¢, Xj_rf +2 ), (Xj +1 ,Xj, â â â rXj-d+i)} and X; + i is the successor of the 
nearest neighbor of Xj in phase space. Likewise, we denote by XUF, -,, and call "non colinear", 
the candidate which minimizes the scalar product in Expression (3). 

In words, the algorithm assumes that when the value of the LLE is low, the orbit is relatively 
smooth, suggesting that the trajectory to be predicted behaves similarly as the nearest

neighbor's trajectory. Alternatively, when the LLE is "large", the trajectory is considered to 
behave erratically, so that the trajectory to be predicted is assumed to differ from that of its 
nearest neighbor. 

Intuition suggests that one may need to estimate the optimal value of the threshold A in 
terms of prediction accuracy for each chaotic system. Hence, we calculate the mean squared 
error (MSE) of the predictor using the above selection algorithm (2) in order to assess which 
threshold A minimizes the MSE:

with X? (A) = X c t or X" c according to selection algorithm (2), and where n is the number of 
predictions. We compute MSE S (A) across all values of A in the range of the system's LLE 
over the last 1000 observations of our sample (ft = 1000) using the entire, true information set 
leading up to the predictee for each prediction. Figure 4 plots the values of MSE S as a function 
of A for the Rossler, Lorenz and Chua attractors. We find that MSE S (A) is smallest when A is 
the upper bound of the range. In other words, our method seems to not require estimating 
the optimal threshold, A, as one is better off always selecting the colinear candidate and not 
conditioning the selection process on the LLE, as intuition might have suggested.

Table 1. MSE C , MSE NN and MSE b are as defined in (4), (5) and (6). p is the selection success 
rate of the colinear selector. Af is the value of the LLE on the 1,000 observations to be 
predicted. ^ t \fail * s me value of the LLE on the observations where the colinear selector does 
not select the best candidate. 

For all three systems, we find that MSE C is substantially smaller than MSE NN . Moreover, 
MSE C is relatively close to MSE , suggesting that our procedure selects the best of the two 
candidates quite often. In fact, on all three attractors, we obtain success rate, p, close to 100%. 
Finally, on the few predictions where our predictor does select the "wrong" candidate, the 
value of the LLE is relatively high compared to the average LLE on the attractor (0.25 versus 
0.13 for Rossler, 0.44 versus 0.19 for Lorenz, and 0.33 versus 0.06 for Chua). These findings 
are consistent with the intuition that prediction is more difficult in regions of the attractor 
which are more sensitive to initial conditions. While this finding seems to confirm that the 
value of the LLE plays a small role in the selection problem, recall that our results show that 
conditioning selection on the value of the LLE would not lead to improved predictions, as 
measured by MSE S (X). 



4. Forecasting 

In this section, we detail the role of the value of the LLE on the size of errors and on the 
performance of the selection procedure as well as the performance of the predictor in the 
short and medium run.

Chaotic Systems 



4.1 Role of the LLE on error size 

The following tables show the success rates of the selection procedure of X c and the resulting 
MSE broken down in small value intervals for the LLE. Doing so allows one to assess how 
the performance of the procedure and of the predictor depends on the (local) chaoticity of 
the region considered, p represents the ratio of the number of times the best candidate 
was selected over the number of predictions in the interval considered. These predictions 
are then broken down into the number of good selection (n succ ) and the number of failures 
to select the best candidate (fif a n). Next, MSE C shows the mean squared error of our 
predictor (using colinear selection) on each interval. MSE c \succ. and MSE c \fail show the 
value of MSE C considering only the predictions where the best candidate was correctly and 
incorrectly selected, respectively. Finally, MSE displays the mean squared error of the 
nearest neighbor predictor on the relevant interval.

Table 2. Each row relates to observations Xf for which the LLE belongs to Af range, p is the 
selection success ratio (1=100%). n succ and nc a n are the number of predictions for which the 
colinear selector selects correctly and incorrectly, respectively. MSE C and MSE are as 
defined in (4) and (5). MSE c \succ and MSE c \fail correspond to MSE C restricted to the 
previously defined n succ and nt a u observations, respectively. 

Notice that for all three attractors the size of errors is relatively stable over the range of 
LLEs when selection is successful. This indicates that our method accurately corrects for the 
dispersion of neighboring trajectories as measured by the value of the LLE. If this were not 
the case, one would expect the MSE to increase monotonically with the value of LLE. In fact, 
errors become large only for values of the LLE near the upper end of their range (above 0.9 for 
the Rossler attractor, above 1.1 for the Lorenz attractor, and above 0.5 for the Chua attractor). 
A possible reason for this sudden increase may be that our estimator for the value of the LLEs 
is not sufficiently robust in regions of high chaoticity. We expect that a more sophisticated 
estimation method for the LLE may solve this issue, which we address in a companion paper. 
Notice that for the Rossler attractor, for most values of the LLE, the size of errors when failing 
to select is on average less than when selecting accurately. For example, for A 6 [0.5,0.7],

colinear selector selects correctly and incorrectly, respectively. MSE C and MSE are as

previously defined n succ and ny fl ,-; observations, respectively. 

MSE c \ SUC c = 0.0052 > 0.0009 = MSE C | f fl ,;. This apparently surprising observation is actually 
encouraging as it indicates that selection mistakes occur mostly when there is little need for 
correction. Such situations may arise because Xj-'s nearest neighbor is very close to Xj or, 
alternatively, when both candidates, ij +l and Xj +1 are both very close to x, + i due to space 
orientation considerations. The same phenomenon can be observed for the Lorenz system up 
to A = 0.1 and for A > 1.3, but is less systematic for the Chua system. 

Regarding the selection accuracy as measured by p, we find that our algorithm selects almost 
perfectly for all three attractors, and in most ranges of A. As expected, p dips slightly for 
larger values of A in the case of the Rossler and Lorenz attractors, which is in line with the 
common intuition according to which trajectories are more stable, or smoother, where the 
value of the LLE is small and more irregular for large values of the LLE. Surprisingly, the 
Chua attractor behaves somewhat differently. Interestingly, selection mistakes occur on all 
attractors for negative values of the LLE, where the system is supposedly locally "stable". 
Hence, our results suggest that the focal value of A = 0, traditionally separating order from 
chaos, bears little meaning in terms of forecasting.

4.2 Forecasting several steps ahead 

We now explore the possibility of forecasting a chaotic time series several steps ahead using 
our correction method. In order to make predictions /2-steps ahead, we proceed iteratively, 
including the successive one-step predictions. 10 

In addition to extending our predictions to several steps ahead, we jointly investigate the role 
of the number of neighbors to consider in the prediction and in the estimation of the LLE. We 
estimated the LLE using Wolff's (1992) algorithm with infinite bandwith and k neighbors, and 
applied our correction method to the average of the images of these neighbors (kâ NNP). 

4.2.1 Rossler attractor 

The following table shows MSE C and MSE NN as a function of the number of neighbors 
and the prediction horizon in the top and bottom half of the table, respectively. For each 
column, and for each predictor, the numbers shown in bold are the smallest mean squared 
error for each horizon. Therefore, the corresponding number of neighbors, k, is optimal for 
that horizon. 

As expected, predictions are more accurate in the shorter run. Moreover, increasing the 
number of neighbors, k, generally seems to decrease the accuracy of the prediction. Note 



For instance, X t+ 2 is obtained by constructing the (estimated) history (Xi,...,Xt,Xt + i). Next, X t+ s is 
obtained via history (Xj, ..., X t , X t+ i, Xt+2), ar >d so on. Hence,no further information is injected to the 
true information set (Xi,...,X t ).

that this is also true for the uncorrected nearest-neighbor predictor. Finally our correction 
method improves upon the uncorrected nearest-neighbor predictor up until six steps ahead. 

4.2.2 Lorenz attractor 

Here also, predictions are more accurate in the shorter run. However, unlike for the Rossler 

attractor, the simulation results suggest that accuracy increases with k up to a point (k = 4). 

Beyond that, increasing the number of neighbors is detrimental to the accuracy of the method 

(except for h = 20, which is too large a horizon for our predictions to be trusted). 

As is the case with the Rossler attractor, our method performs uniformly better than the 

corresponding uncorrected nearest-neighbor predictor for horizons of up to seven steps 

ahead. 

4.2.3 Double scroll attractor 

Again, we see that our prediction results improve upon those of the corresponding 
uncorrected fc-nearest-neighbor predictor, but only in the very short run (up to h = 2). Also, as 
was the case with the other systems, the optimal number of neighbors is low: k = 2. Beyond 
that number, any information carried by neighbors farther away seems to only pollute the 
prediction results 



5. Concluding comments 

We further developed the methodology on using the information contained in the LLE to 
improve forecasts. Our contributions is threefold. First, the selection problem is not an issue, 
and does not require conditioning candidate selection on the value of the LLE. Next, our

results confirm that it is indeed possible to use information on the LLE to improve forecasts. 
We also highlight an interesting fact: the focal value of A = 0, which traditionally separates 
order from chaos, does not play any role in the forecasting of chaotic systems. In other words, 
our methodology performs equally well on both stable and chaotic regions of the attractors 
studies. Finally, we examined the sensitivity of our methodology to varying the number k of 
neighbors as well as of the step-ahead horizon, h. While our goal was not to determine the 
optimal number of neighbors to consider for forecasting, it seems that each attractor admits a 
rather low optimal number of neighbors. We have worked with a fixed embedding dimension, 
d, throughout. Now that we have ascertained the validity of the approach, the next step is to 
confirm its performance on real physical or financial data.

1. Introduction 

Since the pioneer work of Lorenz on predictability problems [1-2], many studies have 
examined the relationships between predictability and initial error in chaotic systems [3-7]; 
however, these previous studies focused on multi-scale complex systems such as the 
atmosphere and oceans [4-6]. Because large uncertainties exist regarding the dynamic 
equations and observational data related to such complex systems, there also exists 
uncertainty in any conclusions drawn regarding the relationship between the predictability 
of such systems and initial error. In addition, multi-scale complex systems such as the 
atmosphere are thought to have an intrinsic upper limit of predictability due to interactions 
among different scales [2, 4-6]. The predictability time of multi-scale complex systems, 
regardless of the errors in initial conditions, cannot exceed their intrinsic limit of 
predictability. 

For relatively simple chaotic systems with a single characteristic timescale driven by a small 
number of variables (e.g., the logistic map [7] and the Lorenz63 model [1]), their predictability 
limits continuously depend on the initial errors: the smaller the initial error, the greater the 
predictability limit. If the initial perturbation is of size S and if the accepted error tolerance, 
A , remains small, then the largest Lyapunov exponent Ay gives a rough estimate of the 

A s o 

commonly proves to be a considerable oversimplification [8]. This generally occurs because 
the largest Lyapunov exponent Ay , which we term the largest global Lyapunov exponent, is 
defined as the long-term average growth rate of a very small initial error. It is commonly the 
case that we are not primarily concerned with averages, and, even if we are, we may be 
interested in short-term behavior. Consequently, various local or finite-time Lyapunov 
exponents have been proposed, which measure the short-term growth rate of initial small 
perturbations [9-12]. However, the existing local or finite-time Lyapunov exponents, which 
are the same as the global Lyapunov exponent, are established based on the assumption that 
the initial perturbations are sufficiently small that their evolution can be approximately 
governed by the tangent linear model (TLM) of the nonlinear model, which essentially belongs 
to linear error dynamics. Clearly, as long as an uncertainty remains infinitesimal in the 



predictability time: T ~ â ln( â ). However, reliance on the largest Lyapunov exponent 



40 Chaotic Systems 

framework of linear error dynamics, it cannot pose a limit to predictability. To determine the 
limit of predictability, any proposed 'local Lyapunov exponent' must be defined with respect 
to the nonlinear behavior of nonlinear dynamical systems [13-14]. 

Recently, the nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent (NLLE) [15-17], which is a nonlinear 
generalization to the existing local Lyapunov exponents, was introduced to study the 
predictability of chaotic systems. NLLE measures the averaged growth rate of initial errors of 
nonlinear dynamical models without linearizing the governing equations. Using NLLE and its 
derivatives, the limit of dynamical predictability in large classes of chaotic systems can be 
efficiently and quantitatively determined. NLLE shows superior performance, compared with 
local or finite-time Lyapunov exponents based on linear error dynamics, in determining 
quantitatively the predictability limit of chaotic system. In the present study, we explore the 
relationship between the predictability limit and initial error in simple chaotic systems based 
on the NLLE approach, taking the logistic map and Lorenz63 model as examples. 

2. Nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent (NLLE) 

For an n-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system, its nonlinear perturbation equations are 
given by: 

^-8(f) = J(x(0)8(0 + G(x(0,8(0) , (1) 

at 

where x(t) - (x l (t),x 2 (t), r x n {t)) is the reference solution, T is the transpose, J(x(7))8(7) 

are the tangent linear terms, and G(x(t),d(t)) are the high-order nonlinear terms of the 

perturbation S(t) = (S 1 (t),S 2 (t), 'S n (t)) . Most previous studies have assumed that the 

initial perturbations are sufficiently small that their evolution could be approximately 
governed by linear equations [9-12]. However, linear error evolution is characterized by 
continuous exponential growth, which is not applicable to the description of a process that 
evolves from initially exponential growth to finally reaching saturation for sufficiently small 
errors (see Fig. 1). This linear approximation is also not applicable to situations in which the 
initial errors are not very small. Therefore, the nonlinear behaviors of error growth should 
be considered to determine the limit of predictability. Without linear approximation, the 
solutions of Eq. (1) can be obtained by numerical integration along the reference solution 
x(t) from t - t to t +r : 

8(f + r) = ii(x(? ),8(f ),r)8(f ), (2) 

where T|(x(7 ),8(f ),r) is the nonlinear propagator. NLLE is then defined as 

A(x(, ),8( fo ), r) = ilnM^, (3) 

where A(x(t ),d(t ),r) depends in general on the initial state x(f ) in phase space, the initial 
error 8(7 ) , and time x . This differs from the existing local or finite-time Lyapunov 
exponents, which are defined based on linear error dynamics [9-12]. In the case of double 
limits of ||8(f )|| â > and r â > <x> , NLLE converges to the largest global Lyapunov exponent 
Ay . The ensemble mean NLLE over the global attractor of the dynamical system is given by 



Relationship between the Predictability Limit and Initial Error in Chaotic Systems 41 

= (A(x(t ),8(t ),r)) N ,(N^Â») (4) 

where Q represents the domain of the global attractor of the system, and ( ) denotes the 
ensemble average of samples of sufficiently large size N (N â Â» oo ). The mean relative 
growth of initial error (RGIE) can be obtained by 

E(8(f ),r) = exp(X(8(f ),r)r). (5) 

Using the theorem from Ding and Li [16], then we obtain 

E(5(* ),r)â ^->c(N-> oo ), (6) 

where > denotes the convergence in probability and c is a constant that depends on 

the converged probability distribution of error growth P . This is termed the saturation 
property of RGIE for chaotic systems. The constant c can be considered as the theoretical 

saturation level of E(8(f ),r) . Once the error growth reaches the saturation level, almost all 

information on initial states is lost and the prediction becomes meaningless. Using the 

theoretical saturation level, the limit of dynamical predictability can be determined 

â 1 â 

quantitatively [15-16]. In addition, for A(8(f ),r) = â In E(8(f ),r) , based on the above 

analysis, we have 

_ -i 

A(8(f ),r) >â xlnc as râ >co; (7) 

T 

therefore, A(8(f ),r) asymptotically decreases like 0(l/r ) as r â >co . The magnitude of the 
initial error S Q is defined as the norm of the vector error 8(f ) in phase space at the initial 
time t ; i.e., S = |8(f )| . The results show that the limit of dynamical predictability depends 
mainly on the magnitude of the initial error 5(t ) and rather than on its direction, because 
the error direction in the phase space becomes rapidly aligned toward the most unstable 
direction (Fig. 2). 

3. Experimental predictability results 

The first example is the logistic map [7], 

y n+ i="y n (i-y n ),o<a<4, (8) 

Here, we choose the parameter value of a =4.0, for which the logistic map is chaotic on the 
set (0,1) [18-19]. Figure 3 shows the dependence of the mean NLLE and the mean RGIE on 
the magnitude of the initial error. The mean NLLE is essentially constant in a plateau region 
that widens as decreasing initial error S Q (Fig. 3a). For a sufficiently long time, however, all 
the curves are asymptotic to zero. This finding reveals that for a very small initial error, 



42 Chaotic Systems 

error growth is initially exponential, with a growth rate consistent with the largest global 
Lyapunov exponent, indicating that linear error dynamics are applicable during this phase. 
Subsequently, the error growth enters a nonlinear phase with a steadily decreasing growth 
rate, finally reaching a saturation value. 

Figure 3b shows that the time at which the error growth reaches saturation also lengthens as 
<5q is reduced. Regardless of the magnitude of the initial error S , all the errors ultimately 

reach saturation. To estimate the predictability time of a chaotic system, the predictability 
limit is defined as the time at which the error reaches 99% of its saturation level. The limit of 
dynamic predictability is found to decrease approximately linearly as increasing logarithm 
of initial error (Fig. 4). For a specific initial error, the limit of dynamic predictability is longer 
than the time for which the tangent linear approximation holds, which is defined as the time 
over which the mean NLLE remains constant. The difference between the predictability 
limit and the time over which the tangent linear approximation holds, remains largely 
constant as increasing logarithm of initial error, suggesting that the time over which the 
nonlinear phase of error growth lasts may be constant for initial errors of various 
magnitudes. 
The second example is the Lorenz63 model [1], 

X = -oX + o-Y 

Y = rX-Y-XZ, (9) 

Z = XY-bZ 

where a =10, r =28, and b =8/3, for which the well-known "butterfly" attractor exists. 
Figure 5 shows the mean NLLE and mean RGIE with initial errors of various magnitudes as 
a function of time x . For all initial errors, the mean NLLE is initially unstable, then remains 
constant and finally decreases rapidly, approaching zero as increasing r (Fig. 5a). For a very 
small initial error, it does not take long for error growth to become exponential, with a 
growth rate consistent with the largest global Lyapunov exponent, indicating that linear 
error dynamics are applicable during this phase. Subsequently, error growth enters a 
nonlinear phase with a steadily decreasing growth rate, finally reaching a saturation value 
(Fig. 5b). For initial errors of various magnitudes, the predictability limit of the Lorenz63 
model is defined as the time at which the error reaches 99% of its saturation level, similar to 
the case for the logistic map. 

Figure 6 shows the predictability limit and the time over which the tangent linear 
approximation holds as a function of the magnitude initial error. The predictability limit of 
the Lorenz63 model decreases approximately linearly as increasing logarithm of initial error, 
similar to the logistic map. For the Lorenz63 model, the difference between the predictability 
limit and the time over which the tangent linear approximation holds, remains largely 
constant as increasing logarithm of initial error. 

4. Theoretical predictability analysis 

As shown above, there exists a linear relationship between the predictability limit and the 
logarithm of initial error, for both the logistic map and Lorenz63 model. To understand the 
reason for this linear relationship, it is necessary to further investigate the relationship 
between the predictability limit and the logarithm of initial error using the theoretical 



Relationship between the Predictability Limit and Initial Error in Chaotic Systems 43 

analysis, to determine if a general law exists between the predictability limit and the 
logarithm of initial error for chaotic systems. 

For relatively simple chaotic systems such as the logistic map and Lorenz63 model, the 
predictability limit T is assumed to consist of the following two parts: 

T P =T L +T N , (10) 

where T L is the time over which the tangent linear approximation holds, and T N is the time 
over which the nonlinear phase of error growth occurs. When the mean error reaches a 
critical value S c , which is thought to be almost constant for a chaotic system under the 
condition of the given parameters, the tangent linear approximation is no longer valid and 
the error growth enters the nonlinear phase. Under the condition of the given parameters, 
the saturation value of error E is constant, which is not dependent on the initial error. 
Consequently, the time T N taken for the error growth from S c to E can be considered as 
almost constant, not relying on the initial error. This assumption is confirmed by the 
experimental results shown in Figs. 3 and 5, which indicate that the interval between the 
predictability limit and the time over which the tangent linear approximation holds, remains 
almost constant as increasing logarithm of initial error. Then, T N can be written as a 
constant: 

r N =c a . (ii) 

For T L , the time over which the tangent linear approximation holds, we get 

Â£ C =<V^(AT L ), (12) 

where S is the initial error and Ay is the largest global Lyapunov exponent. From Eq. (12), 
we have 



T '-T to 2 

A \. 5 oj 



(13) 



From Eqs. (10), (11), and (13), we obtain 



r p =C 1 +-]-[ln < y c -ln^]. (14) 

A 

Under the condition of the given parameters, A : of the chaotic system is fixed, as is 

1 1 

â ln<y c . Then, we have â In S c = C 2 (where C 2 is a constant). Therefore, T can be written 



T=C -Â±-hxS , (15)

where C =C 1 +C 2 â  Eq. (15) can be changed to 



44 Chaotic Systems 



1 togio ^o 
A lo Si 



T p =C-^- 7 B10 "Â° . (16) 



If the largest global Lyapunov exponent A 1 and the constant C are known in advance, the 
predictability limit can be obtained for initial errors of any magnitude, according to Eq. (16). 
The constant C can be calculated from Eq. (16) if the predictability limit corresponding to a 
fixed initial error has been obtained in advance through the NLLE approach. 

5. Experimental verification of theoretical results 

Using the method proposed by Wolf et al. [20], the largest global Lyapunov exponent A x 
of the logistic map is 0.693 when a = 4.0 . From Eq. (16), we have the formula that 
describes the relationship between the predictability limit and the initial error of the 
logistic map: 

r p =C-3.321og 10 V (17) 

For S = 10~ , the predictability limit of the logistic map is T = 18 , as obtained using the 
NLLE approach. Then, we have C = -1.92 in Eq. (17). Therefore, the predictability limit for 
various initial errors can be obtained from Eq. (17). The predictability limits obtained in this 
way are in good agreement with those obtained using the NLLE approach (Fig. 7). This 
finding indicates that the assumptions presented in Section 3 are indeed reasonable. 
Therefore, it is appropriate to determine the predictability limit of the logistic map by 
extrapolating Eq. (17) to various initial errors. 

The largest global Lyapunov exponent A 1 of the Lorenz63 model is obtained to be 0.906 
when a =10, r =28, b =8/3. From Eq. (16), we have the formula that describes the 
relationship between the predictability limit and the initial error of the Lorenz63 model: 

T p =C-2.541og 10 <V (18) 

For S Q = 10" , the predictability limit of the Lorenz63 model is T = 22.19 , as obtained using 
the NLLE approach. Then, we have C = 6.95 in Eq. (17). Therefore, the predictability limits 
for various initial errors can be obtained by extrapolating the Eq. (17) to various initial 
errors. The resulting limits are in good agreement with those obtained using the NLLE 
approach (Fig. 8). The linear relationship between the predictability limit and the logarithm 
of initial error is further verified by the Lorenz63 model, and the relationship may be 
applicable to other simple chaotic systems. 

6. Summary 

Previous studies that examine the relationship between predictability and initial error in 
chaotic systems with a single characteristic timescale were based mainly on linear error 
dynamics, which were established based on the assumption that the initial perturbations are 
sufficiently small that their evolution could be approximately governed by the TLM of the 
nonlinear model. However, linear error dynamics involves large limitations, which is not 
applicable to determine the predictability limit of chaotic systems. 



Relationship between the Predictability Limit and Initial Error in Chaotic Systems 



45 



Taking the logistic map and Lorenz63 model as examples, we investigated the relationship 
between the predictability limit and initial error in chaotic systems, using the NLLE 
approach, which involves nonlinear error growth dynamics. There exists a linear 
relationship between the predictability limit and the logarithm of initial error. A theoretical 
analysis performed under the nonlinear error growth dynamics revealed that the growth of 
mean error enters a nonlinear phase after it reaches a certain critical magnitude, finally 
reaching saturation. For a given chaotic system, if the control parameters of the system are 
given, then the saturation value of error growth is fixed. The time taken for error growth 
from the nonlinear phase to saturation is also almost constant for various initial errors. The 
predictability limit is only dependent on the phase of linear error growth. Consequently, 
there exists a linear relationship between the predictability limit and the logarithm of initial 
error. The linear coefficient is related to the largest global Lyapunov exponent: the greater 
the latter, the more rapidly the predictability limit decreases as increasing logarithm of 
initial error. If the largest global Lyapunov exponent and the predictability limit 
corresponding to a fixed initial error are known in advance, the predictability limit can be 
extrapolated to various initial errors based on the linear relationship between the 
predictability limit and the logarithm of initial error. 

It should be noted that the linear relationship between the predictability limit and the 
logarithm of initial error holds only in the case of relatively small initial errors. If the initial 
errors are large, the growth of the mean error would directly enter into the nonlinear phase, 
meaning that the linear relationship would fail to describe the relationship between the 
predictability limit and the logarithm of initial error. A more complex relationship may exist 
between the predictability limit and initial errors, which is an important subject left for 
future research.

1. Introduction 

It has been one of the important fields of contemporary science to explore the microscopic 
origin of the damping phenomenon of collective motion in the finite many-body system. 
The evolution of the early universe, that of the chemical reaction, many active processes 
in biological system, the fission and fusion processes in nuclear system, the quantum 
correspondent of the classically chaotic system and the measurement theory are typical 
examples among others(l-14). Although these processes have been successfully described 
by the phenomenological transport equation, there still remain some basic problems, such 
as, how to derive the macro-level transport equation describing the macroscopic irreversible 
motion from the micro-level reversible dynamics from the fundamental level dynamics; how 
the statistical state is realized in the irrelevant subsystem and why the irreversible macro-level 
process is generated as a result of the reversible micro-level dynamics. 

The study on this subject has been one of the most fundamental and challenging fields in 
the various fields of contemporary science. Intensive studies have been carried out (15-29), 
however, an acceptance microscopic understanding is still far from realization and there still 
remain a lot of studies(30-33). 

1.1 From reversible to irreversible: Foundation of statistical physics 

Before discussing the microscopic origin of irreversibility phenomenon, one should be aware 
of an informal indication of the problem in explaining the meaning of the foundation 
of statistical physics, which can be seen in the presence of two types of processes: (1) 
time-irreversible macroscopic (relevant or collective) process which obey the thermodynamics, 
or kinetic, laws; and (2) time-reversible microscopic (irrelevant or intrinsic) process which 
obey, say, the Newton and Maxwell equations of motion. The great difference between 
both descriptions of the processes in nature, is not clearly understood and an acceptance 
explanation on the origin of irreversibility is still lack(34). The formal definition of the problem 
is to derive a macroscopic equation which describes an irreversible evolution which begins 
with a reversible Hamiltonian equation. 

Before the recognition of the importance of chaos, the attempts to unite, in a formal way, 
the statistical and dynamical description of a system, usually starts with dividing the total 
system into the relevant and irrelevant degrees of freedom by hand and assuming the 
irrelevant system placed in a state of micro-canonical equilibrium (thermodynamical) state 



52 Chaotic Systems 

(Ref. Boltzmann's pioneer proposal(35) and the textbooks as (36)). This is the Boltzmann 
principle 

S = fcln.4(E). (1) 

where .4(E) is the area of the phase space explored by the system in a micro-canonical state, 
k the Boltzmann constant and S the entropy. However, such the derivations are essentially 
based on the assumption of an infinitely large number of degrees of freedom and the existence 
of two different time scales T r ^> t,, where x r is the time scale of relevant degrees of freedom 
and T; is that of irrelevant ones. Under such assumption, the irreversibility or the equilibrium 
condition is supplemented for the dynamical equations, and the resultant distribution has the 
form 

P(e) ~ e~P e $ = 1/kT (2) 

where e is the energy of the irrelevant degrees of freedom and T the temperature of the system. 
Distribution (2) is called the equilibrium Boltzmann distribution which corresponds to the 
thermodynamical state and thus only can be adopted to describe the equilibrium process rather 
than nonequilibrium states. It also should be mentioned that Poincare recurrence theorem says 
that for a finite and area-preserving motion, any trajectory should return to an arbitrarily 
taken domain E in a finite time and should do so repeatedly for an infinite number of time. 
However, Boltzmann had rightly argue that for a large number of particles, this recurrence 
time would be astronomically long. This assumption only can be justified for a system with 
infinite number of degrees of freedom. When one want to study the origin of irreversibility 
of a finite system where dynamical chaos occurs, this assumption of infinite occurrence time 
will cause some serious problems. 

Many attempts have been successfully achieved in different ways and with some 
supplementary conditions on microscopic Hamiltonian equations, such as the random phase 
approximation (mixing)(37; 38), Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE), or other equivalent 
conditions played the role of statistical element(15-20; 25-29; 39). The ergodic and irreversible 
property is assumed for the irrelevant system with infinite number of degree of freedom. 
Temperature, so as thermodynamics, is introduced by hand through the supplementary 
conditions. From dynamical point of view, such the derivation is unsatisfactory since the 
strong condition like randomness of some variables or statistical ansatz should be introduced 
by hand. Following the recognition of the importance of chaos, it has been supposed that there 
is an intimate relation between the realization of irreversibility and the order-to-chaos transition within 
the microscopic Hamilton dynamics. When one derives the macroscopic irreversibility from 
the fundamental Hamiltonian equations, the stochastic processes can be obtained for some 
specific parameters and initial conditions. However even in this case, such the supplementary 
assumptions still remain to be justified. The main problems are: whether or not one may 
substantiate statistical state in the way dynamical chaos is structured in real Hamiltonian 
system, whether or not there are some difficulties of using the properties of dynamical chaos as 
a source of randomness, whether one can derive a random process from the dynamical chaotic 
motion and whether or in what conditions, the derived stochastic process may correspond 
to the above-mentioned random assumptions. It is well known that Poincare recurrence 
time is finite for finite Hamiltonian systems and its phase space has fractal (or multi-fractal) 
structure, where the ergodicity of motion is not generally satisfied. Therefore, specially in 
the finite system, it is not a trivial discussion whether or not the irrelevant subsystem can be 
effectively replaced by a statistical object as a heat bath, even when it shows chaotic behavior 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 53 

and its Lyapunov exponent has a positive value everywhere in the phase space. It is also an 
interesting question to explore the relation between the dynamical definition of the statistical 
state, if it exists, and the static definition of it. 

1.2 From infinite to finite system 

It should say that there is substantial difficulty or it is almost impossible in some extent, for 
us to derive the macroscopic irreversibility from the fundamental Hamiltonian equations for 
an infinite system because which has an infinite (or extremely large) number of degrees of 
freedom. This fact is generally accepted as the reason for the introduction of the statistical 
assumptions. On another hand, when one derive macroscopic equations by averaging over 
microscopic random variables resulted in a reduced description of an in nite system, the 
detailed structure of micro phase space will lose its importance. In this sense, for an in nite 
system, such the statistical approach seems to be reasonable and will not cause any serious 
problems. 

However, in such systems as atoms, nuclei and biomolecules whose environment is not 
infinite, where assumption of a large number of degrees of freedom is not justified, and 
in a case when one intends to derive the macroscopic irreversibility and phenomenological 
transport equation from the fundamental level dynamics, it is not obvious whether or not one 
may introduce the statistical assumptions for the irrelevant degrees of freedom. The decisive 
problem in the finite system is how to justify an introduction of some statistical state or some 
statistical concept like the temperature or the heat bath, which is one of the basic ingredient to 
derive an irreversible process to the Hamilton system. 

With regards to the damping phenomena observed in the giant resonance on top of the 
highly excited states in the nuclear system, its microscopic description has been mainly 
based on the temperature dependent mean-field theory (40^15). However, an introduction 
of the temperature in the finite-isolated nuclei is by no means obvious, when one explicitly 
introduce many single-particle excitation modes on top of the temperature-dependent shell 
model. Could one introduce a chaotic (complex) excitation mode on top of the chaotic (heat 
bath characterized by the temperature) system? When one considers the Ip-lh (two-particle 
two-hole) state as a door way state to be coupled with the lp-lh collective excitation mode, 
a naive classical model Hamilton would be something like a /3 Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) 
system(46^19) where no heat bath is assumed, rather than the temperature-dependent shell 
model where the Matsubara Green function is used. 

The recent development in the classical theory of nonlinear Hamiltonian system (22; 34; 50- 
53) has shown that there appears an exceedingly rich structure in the phase space, which is 
usually considered to prevent a fully developed chaos. The existence of fractal structure is a 
remarkable property of Hamilton chaos and a typical feature of the phase space in real system. 
Due to the fractal structure of the phase space, the motion of Hamilton system of general type 
is not ergodic, specially for a finite Hamiltonian system. In this case, the questions then arise: 
what kind random process corresponds to the dynamical chaotic motion? whether or not 
the system dynamically reaches some statistical object? The microscopic derivation of the 
non-equilibrium statistical physics in relation with the exceedingly rich structure of the phase 
space as well as with the order-to-chaos transition might be explored within the microscopic 
Hamilton dynamics. This subject will be further discussed in Sec. 4.1.2. 

Another important issue related to this study is how to divide the total system into the relevant 
and irrelevant degrees of freedom. However, in many approaches(24; 26; 27), one usually 
starts with dividing the total system into the relevant and irrelevant degrees of freedom 



54 Chaotic Systems 

by hand. In the system where a total number of degrees of freedom can be approximately 
treated as an infinite, there does not arise any serious problem how to introduce the relevant 
degrees of freedom. In the finite system as nuclei where a number of the degrees of freedom 
is not large enough, and a time scale of the relevant motion and that of the irrelevant one 
is typically less than one order of magnitude difference, there arises an important problem 
how to distinguish the relevant ones from the rest in a way consistent with the underlying 
microscopic dynamics for aiming to properly characterize the collective motion. Here it worth 
to mention another important issue is related with an applicability of the linear response theory 
(LRT)(54-59), because a validity of the linear approximation for the macro-level dynamics 
does not necessarily justify that for the micro-level dynamics. Furthermore, there arises a 
basic question whether or not one may divide the total system into the relevant and irrelevant 
subsystems by leaving the linear coupling between them(30; 50; 60-62). At the best of our 
knowledge, it seems that there is no compelling physical reason to choose the linear coupling 
interaction between the relevant and irrelevant subsystems. 

Summarily speaking, in exploring the microscopic dynamics in nite Hamiltonian system, says, 
answering the basic questions as listed in the beginning of this section, there are two main 
subjects. One is how to divide the total system into the relevant and irrelevant ones and another is how 
to derive the macroscopic statistical properties from microscopic dynamics. 

1.3 The nonlinear theory of the classical Hamiltonian system 

From above discussion, one can conclude that the theory of chaotic dynamics should play a 
decisive role in understanding the origin of microscopic irreversibility within the microscopic 
Hamilton dynamics. It is imperative to remember the recent development in the classical 
theory of nonlinear Hamilton system(34; 51-53). 

The chaos phenomenon is often used to describe the motions of the system's trajectories 
which are sensitive to the slightest changes of the initial condition. The motion known as 
chaotic occupies a certain area (called stochastic sea) in the phase space. In idea chaos, 
the stochastic sea is occupied in uniform manner. This is, however, not the case in real 
systems. The phase space has exceedingly rich structure where the chaotic and regular 
motions co-exist and there are many islands which a chaotic trajectory can not penetrate 
(as stated in KAM Theorem). Many important properties of chaotic dynamics, such as the 
order-to-chaos transition dynamics, are determined by the properties of the motion near the 
boundary of islands. 

Thanks to H. Poincare and his successors, we know how important it is to understand why 
there appears an exceedingly rich structure in the phase space and how the order-to-chaos 
transition occurs, rather than to understand individual trajectory under a specific initial 
condition. A set of closed orbits having the same property (characterized by a set of local 
constants of motion) forms a torus structure around a certain stable fixed point in the phase 
space, and is separated from the other types of closed orbits (characterized by another set of 
local constants of motion) through separatrices. Depending on the strength of the nonlinear 
interaction or on the energy of the system, there appear many kinds of new periodic orbits 
characterized by respective local constants of motion along the known periodic orbits, which 
are called bifurcation phenomena. 

When different separatrices start to overlap in a small region of the phase space, there appears 
a local chaotic sea. In this overlap region where two kinds of periodic orbits characterized 
by different sets of constants of motion start to coexist, it might become difficult to realize 
a well-developed closed orbit characterized by a single set of local constants of motion any

more. This overlap criterion on an appearance of the chaotic sea has been considered to be a 
microscopic origin of the order-to-chaos transition dynamics. 

A classical example of the order-to-chaos transition for the SU(3) classical Hamiltonian system 
(66) is shown in Figs. 1 to 4 for the cases with Vj =-0.01, -0.03, -0.045 and -0.07, respectively. In 
the cases with Vj =-0.01 and -0.03, i.e., the smaller interaction strength or weaker nonlinearity, 
the whole phase space is covered by the regular motions, forming many islands structure. 
When the nonlinearity of interaction goes to stronger, there appears chaotic sea in a region 
where the crossing point of the separatrics (Fig. 3), i.e., the unstable fixed point is expected in 
Fig. 2. Moreover, there appear many secondary islands around the primary island structure, 
which has already existed in Fig. 2. A chaotic trajectory can not penetrate the island and a 
regular trajectory from an island is not be able to escape from it. Around some secondary 
island, one may find some tertiary island structure, and so forth, as shown in Fig. 5. This 
repeated complex structure is called fractal phenomena. The fractal structure of phase space 
is a remarkable property of Hamiltonian chaos and a typical feature of the phase space in 
real systems. For a classical Hamiltonian system, the distribution of the Poincare recurrence 
is time- and space-fractal, which plays a crucial role in an understanding of the general 
properties of chaotic dynamics and the foundation of statistical physics. 

The general theory of the nonlinear dynamics has been developed for aiming to understand 
these complex structure by studying why there appear many stable and unstable fixed points, 
and how to get an information on their constants of motion. And also the theory of nonlinear 
chaotic dynamics plays an important role in understanding the foundation of statistical 
physics.

1.4 The self-consistent collective coordinate (SCC) method & the optimum coordinate 
system 

As discussed in Sect. 1.2, for finite system, an important problem is to explore how to divide 
the total system into the relevant and irrelevant degrees of freedom in a way consistent 
with the underlying microscopic dynamics for aiming to properly characterize the collective 
motion. In a case of the Hamiltonian system, a division may be performed by applying 
the self-consistent collective coordinate (SCC) method(60). In the following, for the sake of 
self-containedness, the SCC method is briefly reformulated within the classical Hamiltonian 
system. The detailed description can be found in Ref. (60) and a review article (50). 
The SCC method was proposed within the usual symplectic manifold, which intends to 
define the maximally-decoupled coordinate system where the minimum number of coordinates is 
required in describing the trajectory under discussion. In such a finite system as the nucleus, 
it is not obvious how to introduce the relevant (collective or distinguished) coordinates which 
are used in describing macroscopic properties of the system. This problem is also very 
important to explore why and how the statistical aspect could appear in the finite nuclear 
system, and whether or not the irrelevant system could be expressed by some statistical object, 
because there is no obvious reason to divide the nuclear system into two, unlike a case with 
the Brownian particle plus molecular system. 

The basic idea of the SCC method rests on the following point: The nonlinear canonical 
transformation between the original coordinate system and a new coordinate one is defined 
in such a way that the anharmonic effects causing the microscopic structure change of the 
relevant coordinates are incorporated into the latter coordinate system as much as possible, 
and the coupling between the relevant and irrelevant subsystems is optimally minimized.

Trajectories in a 2K dimensional symplectic manifold expressed by 

M 2K : [c*,Cf, 7 = 1,- - ,K\ (3) 

are organized by the canonical equations of motion given as 

r dH -r* dH â  1 v tA\ 

where H denotes the Hamiltonian of the system. Let us consider one of the trajectories 
which are obtained by solving Eq. (4) under a set of specific initial conditions. In describing 
a given trajectory it does not matter what coordinate system one may use provided one 
employs the whole degrees of freedom without any truncation. An arbitrary representation 
used in describing the canonical equations of motion in Eq. (4) will be called the initial 
representation (IR). Out of many coordinate systems which are equivalent with each other 
and are related through the canonical transformations with one another, however, one may 
select a maximally -decoupled coordinate system where the minimum number of coordinates is 
required in describing a given trajectory. What one has to do is to extract a small dimensional 
submanifold denoted as M 2L (L < K) on which the given trajectory is confined. The 
representation characterizing the maximally-decoupled coordinate system will be called the 
dynamical representation (DR). Let us introduce a set of canonical variables in the DR. A set 
of coordinates {n^,n a ;a = 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ , L} are called the relevant degrees of freedom and are used 
in describing the given trajectory, whereas {Â£Â£, Â£Â«; oc = L + 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ , K} are called the irrelevant

The basic idea of the SCC method formulated within the TDHF theory rests on the invariance

Equation (21) simply states that the new coordinate system {n a ,n^,^ x ,^} determined by 
the SCC method has no first order couplings between the relevant and irrelevant degrees 
of freedom. With the aid of the SCC method, one may introduce the maximally-decoupled 
coordinate system, where the linear coupling between the relevant and irrelevant degrees of 
freedom is eliminated. This result is very important to treat the collective dissipative motion 
coupled with the irrelevant system. In a case of the infinite system, one may usually apply the 
linear response theory where the relevant system is assumed to be coupled with the irrelevant 
one through the linear coupling, and the latter is usually expressed by a thermal reservoir. 
As we have discussed in this section, however, one may introduce a concept of "relevant" 
degrees of freedom in the finite system after requiring an elimination of the linear coupling 
with leaving only the nonlinear couplings. 

1 .5 The scope of the present work 

In order to explore the microscopic dynamics responsible for the macroscopic transport 
phenomena, a theory of coupled-master equation has been formulated as a general framework 
for deriving the transport equation, and for clarifying its underlying assumptions(23). In order 



62 Chaotic Systems 

to self-consistently and optimally divide the finite system into a pair of weakly coupled systems, 
the theory employs the SCC method(60) as mentioned in Sec. 1.4. The self -consistent and 
optimal separation in the degrees of freedom enables us to study the dissipation mechanisms 
of large-amplitude relevant motion and nonlinear dynamics between the relevant and 
irrelevant modes of motion. An important point of using the SCC method(60) for dynamically 
dividing the total system into two subsystems is a form of the resultant coupling between 
them, where a linear coupling is eliminated by the maximal decoupling condition imposed by 
the method. 

In this chapter, with the microscopic Hamiltonian, we will discuss how to derive the 
transport equation from the general theory of coupled-master equation and how to realize 
the dissipation phenomena in the finite system on the basis of the microscopic dynamics, 
what kinds of necessary conditions there are in realizing the dissipative process, what 
kinds of dynamical relations there are between the micro-level and phenomenological-level 
descriptions, without introducing the any statistical anastz. 

It will be clarified(30) that the macroscopic transport equation is obtained from the fully 
microscopic master equation under the following microscopic conditions: (I) The effects 
coming from the irrelevant subsystem on the relevant one are taken into account and 
mainly expressed by an average effect over the irrelevant distribution function. Namely, 
the fluctuation effects are considered to be sufficiently small and are able to be treated as 
a perturbation around the path generated by the average Hamiltonian. (II) The irrelevant 
distribution function has already reached its time-independent stationary state before the 
main microscopic dynamics responsible for the damping of the relevant motion dominates. 
As discussed in Sec. 3.1.2, this situation was turned out to be well realized even in the two 
degrees of freedom system. (Ill) The time scale of the motion for the irrelevant subsystem is 
much shorter than that for the relevant one. 

The numerical simulations are carried out for a microscopic system composed of the relevant 
one-degree of freedom system coupled to the irrelevant two-degree of freedom system 
(described by a classical SU(3) Hamiltonian) through a weak coupling interaction. The 
novelties of our approach are: (I) the total system is dynamically and optimally divided 
into the relevant and irrelevant degrees of freedom in a way consistent with the underlying 
microscopic dynamics for aiming to properly characterize the collective motion; (II) the 
macroscopic irreversibility is dynamically realized for a finite system rather than introducing 
any statistical anastz as for infinite system with extremely large number of degrees of freedom. 
The transport phenomenon will been established numerically (30). It will be also clarified 
that for the case with a small number degrees of freedom (say, two), the microscopic 
dephasing mechanism, which is caused by the chaoticity of irrelevant system, is responsible 
for the energy transfer from the collective system to the environment. Although our 
numerical simulation by employing the Langevin equation was able to reproduce the 
macro-level transport phenomenon, it was also clarified that there are substantial differences 
in the micro-level mechanism between the fully microscopic description and the Langevin 
description, and in order to reproduce the same results the parameters used in the Langevin 
equation do not satisfy the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. 

Therefore various questions related to the transport phenomenon realized in the finite 
system on how to understand the differences between the above-mentioned two descriptions, 
what kinds of other microscopic mechanisms are there besides the dephasing, and when 
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem comes true etc. are still remained. In the conventional 
approaches like the Fokker-Planck or Langevin type equations, the irrelevant subsystem is 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 63 

always assumed to have a large (even in nite) number of degrees of freedom and is placed 
in a canonically equilibrated state. It is then quite natural to ask whether these problems are 
caused by a limited number (only two) of degrees of freedom in the irrelevant subsystem 
considered in our previous work. In order to fill the gap between two and infinite degrees of 
freedom for the irrelevant subsystem, it is extremely important to study how the microscopic 
dynamics depends on the number of the degrees of freedom in the irrelevant subsystem. 
In this chapter, we will further use a /3-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (/3-FPU) system representing 
the irrelevant system, which allows us to change the number of degrees of freedom very 
conveniently and meanwhile retain the chaoticity of the dynamics of /3-FPU system with the 
same specific dynamical condition. It will be shown that although the dephasing mechanism 
is the main mechanism for a case with a small number of degrees of freedom (say, two), 
the diffusion mechanism will start to play a role as the number of degrees of freedom 
becomes large (say, eight or more), and, in general, the energy transport process occurs by 
passing through three distinct stages, such as the dephasing, the statistical relaxation, and 
the equilibrium regimes. By examining a time evolution of a non-extensive entropy(84), an 
existence of three regimes will be clearly exhibited. 

Exploiting an analytical relation, it will be shown that the energy transport process 
is described by the generalized Fokker-Planck and Langevin type equation, and a 
phenomenological fluctuation-dissipation relation is satisfied in a case with relatively large 
degrees of freedom system. It will be clarified that the irrelevant subsystem with finite 
number of degrees of freedom can be treated as a heat bath with a finite correlation 
time, and the statistical relaxation turns out to be an anomalous diffusion, and both the 
microscopic approach and the conventional phenomenological approach may reach the same 
level description for the transport phenomena only when the number of irrelevant degrees of 
freedom becomes very large. 

It should be mentioned that a necessity of using a non-extensive entropy for characterizing 
the damping phenomenon in the finite system is very interesting in connecting the 
microscopic dynamics and the statistical mechanics, because the non-extensive entropy(83; 84) 
might characterize the non-statistical evolution process more properly than the physical 
Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy. This might suggest us that the damping mechanism in the finite 
system is a non-statistical process, where the usual fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not 
applicable. 

We will be able to reach all these goals only within a microscopic classical dynamics of a 
finite system. The outline of this chapter is as follows. In Sec. 1, we have briefly introduced 
some background knowledge and motivations of this study. This section is written in a very 
compact way because I want to pay my most attention on introducing our new progresses 
what the readers really want to know. The detailed information can be easily found in 
references. In Sec. 2, we briefly recapitulate the theory of coupled-master equation(23) for the 
sake of self-containedness. Starting from the most general coupled-master equation, we try 
to derive the Fokker-Planck and Langevin type equation, by clarifying necessary underlying 
conditions. Aiming to realize such a physical situation where these conditions are satisfied, 
in Sec. 3.1, various numerical simulations will be performed for a system where a relevant 
(collective) harmonic oscillator is coupled with the irrelevant (intrinsic) SU(3) model. After 
numerically realizing a macro-level transport phenomena, we will try to reproduce it by 
using a phenomenological Langevin equation, whose potential is derived microscopically. In 
Sec. 3.2, special emphasis will be put on the effects depending on the number of irrelevant 
degrees of freedom with a microscopic Hamiltonian where irrelevant system is described by 



64 Chaotic Systems 

a /3-Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (/3-FPU) system. We will discuss the behavior of the energy transfer 
process, energy equipartition problem and their dependence on the number of degrees of 
freedom. The time evolution of entropy by using the nonextensive thermo-dynamics and 
microscopic dynamics of non-equilibrium transport process will be examined in Sec. 4. In 
Sec. 5, we 'will further explore our results in an analytical way with deriving a generalized 
Fokker-Planck equation and a phenomenological Fluctuation-Dissipation relation, and will 
discuss the underlying physics. By using the /3-FPU model Hamiltonian, we will further 
explore how different transport phenomena will appear when the two systems are coupled 
with linear or nonlinear interactions in Sec. 6. The last section is devoted for summary and 
discussions. 

2. Theory of coupled-master equations and transport equation of collective 
motion 

As repeatedly mentioned in Sec. 1, when one intends to understand a dynamics of evolution 
of a finite Hamiltonian system which connects the macro-level dynamics with the micro-level 
dynamics, one has to start with how to divide the total system into the weakly coupled 
relevant (collective or macro n,n*) and irrelevant (intrinsic or micro f, Â£*) systems. As an 
example, the nucleus provides us 'with a very nice benchmark field because it shows a 
coexistence of "macroscopic" and "microscopic" effects in association with various "phase 
transitions", and a mutual relation between "classical" and "quantum" effects related with 
the macro-level and micro-level variables, respectively. At certain energy region, the nucleus 
exhibits some statistical aspects which are associated with dissipation phenomena well 
described by the phenomenological transport equation. 

2.1 Nuclear coupled master equation 

Exploring the microscopic theory of nuclear large-amplitude collective dissipative motion, 
whose characteristic energy per nucleon is much smaller than the Fermi energy, one may start 
with the time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. Since the basic equation of the TDHF 
theory is known to be formally equivalent to the classical canonical equations of motion (64), 
the use of the TDHF theory enables us to investigate the basic ingredients of the nonlinear 
nuclear dynamics in terms of the TDHF trajectories. The TDHF equation is expressed as : 

6{Â®(t)\^-H)Mt))=0, (22) 

where | $>(()) is the general time-dependent single Slater determinant given by 

|*(0> = exp {iP} |$ > e> E Â°>, iP = O/?^)^ - /,Â«Â«M,J, (23) 

!'â¢ 

where |<J>o) denotes a HF stationary state, and at(pi = 1,2, ...,m) and bj(i = 1,2,..., n) mean 
the particle- and hole-creation operators with respect to | <t>o) - The HF Hamiltonian H and the 
HF energy Eg are defined as 

H=(*(0|ft|*(0>-Eo, Eo = (O |H|O ). (24) 

With the aid of the self-consistent collective coordinate (SCC) method (60), the whole system 
can be optimally divided into the relevant (collective) and irrelevant (intrinsic) degrees 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 65 

of freedom by introducing an optimal canonical coordinate system called the dynamical 
canonical coordinate (DCC) system for a given trajectory. That is, the total closed system r\ Â£ 
is dynamically divided into two subsystems )/ and Â£, whose optimal coordinate systems are 
expressed as //â, rj% : a = 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ and f â, Â£* : a. = 1, â¢ â¢ â¢ , respectively. The resulting Hamiltonian 
in the DCC system is expressed as: 

H = H t] + Hj + H coupl , (25) 

where Hâ depends on the relevant, H? on the irrelevant, and H cou âi on both the relevant 
and irrelevant variables. The TDHF equation (22) can then be formally expressed as a set of 
canonical equations of motion in the classical mechanics in the TDHF phase space (symplectic 
manifold), as 

^^Wa' ^^-Wa' ^ = a!T ^ = -W, ^ 

Here, it is worthwhile mentioning that the SCC method defines the DCC system so as to 
eliminate the linear coupling between the relevant and irrelevant subsystems, i.e., the maximal 
decoupling condition(23) given by Eq. (20), 



oticoupl 



a v 



= 0, (27) 



is satisfied. This separation in the degrees of freedom will turn out to be very important for 
exploring the energy dissipation process and nonlinear dynamics between the collective and 
intrinsic modes of motion. 

The transport, dissipative and damping phenomena appearing in the nuclear system may 
involve a dynamics described by the wave packet rather than that by the eigenstate. Within 
the mean-field approximation, these phenomena may be expressed by the collective behavior 
of the ensemble of TDHF trajectories, rather than the single trajectory. A difference between 
the dynamics described by the single trajectory and by the bundle of trajectories might 
be related to the controversy on the effects of one-body and two-body dissipations(28; 40; 
41; 65; 66), because a single trajectory of the Hamilton system will never produce any 
energy dissipation. Since an effect of the collision term is regarded to generate many-Slater 
determinants out of the single-Slater determinant, an introduction of the bundle of trajectories 
is considered to create a very similar situation which is produced by the two-body collision 
term. 

In the classical theory of dynamical system, the order-to-chaos transition is usually regarded 
as the microscopic origin of an appearance of the statistical state in the finite system. Since 
one may express the heat bath by means of the infinite number of integrable systems like the 
harmonic oscillators whose frequencies have the Debye distribution, it may not be a relevant 
question whether the chaos plays a decisive role for the dissipation mechanism and for the 
microscopic generation of the statistical state in a case of the infinite system. In the finite 
system where the large number limit is not secured, the order-to-chaos is expected to play a 
decisive role in generating some statistical behavior. 

To deal with the ensemble of TDHF trajectories, we start with the Liouville equation for the 
distribution function: 



66 Chaotic Systems 

p(t) = -iCp(t), C* = i{H,*} PBt (28) 

p(t)= P {ti(t),Ti(t)*,s{tM(t)% 

which is equivalent to TDHF equation (22) . Here the symbol {}p B denotes the Poisson bracket. 
Since we are interested in the time evolution of the bundle of TDHF trajectories, whose bulk 
properties ought to be expressed by the relevant variables alone, we introduce the reduced 
distribution functions as 

p n (t) = Tr ? p(t), Pi {t) = Tr n p{t). (29) 

Here, the total distribution function p(t) is normalized so as to satisfy the relation 

Trp(t) = 1, (30) 

where

Tr v =U) f [dtiadti, T^ = Yl[ [dUdC- (32) 

n j j K j j 

With the aid of the reduced distribution functions Pn(t) and pAt), one may decompose the 
Hamiltonian in Eq. (25) into the form 



H = H v +Hg + H coup i 


(33a) 


= H, + H,(t) + Hg + Hf(t) + H A (t) - E (t),

Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 67 

Through above optimal division of the total system into the relevant and irrelevant degrees of 
freedom, one can treat the two subsystems in a very parallel way. Since one intends to explore 
how the statistical nature appears as a result of the microscopic dynamics, one should not 
introduce any statistical ansatz for the irrelevant distribution function p^ by hand, but should 
properly take account of its time evolution. By exploiting the time-dependent projection 
operator method (67), one may decompose the distribution function into a separable part and 
a correlated one as 

p{t)=p s {t)+ P S), 

p s (t) = P(t)p(t)=pn(t)pz(t), (35) 

p c (t) = (l-P(t))p(t), 
where P(t) is the time-dependent projection operator defined by 

P(t) = p n {t)Tr n +p i {t)Tr i - p,,(t)p^t)Tr v Tr ? . (36) 

From the Liouville equation (28), one gets 

p s (t) = -iP(t)Cp s (t) - iP(t)Â£p c (t), (37a) 

p c (t) = -i(l - P(t))Â£ P s(t) - i(l - P{t))C Pc {t). (37b) 

By introducing the propagator 




l-P(r) 



CdT } , (38) 



where T denotes the time ordering operator, one obtains the master equation for p s {t) as 
p,(t) = -iP{t)Cp s {t)-iP{t)Cg{t,ti)p c [ti) 



t 
dt'P(t)Cg(t,t'){l-P(t')}C Ps (t'), (39) 



I 



where t\ stands for an initial time. In the conventional case, one usually takes an initial 
condition 

p c (ti) = 0, i.e., p(t I )=p l] (t I )-p^t I ). (40) 

That is, there are no correlation at the initial time. According to this assumption, one may 

eliminate the second term on the rhs of Eq. (39). In our present general case, however, we 

have to retain this term, which allows us to evaluate the memory effects by starting from 

various time Â£j. 

With the aid of some properties of the projection operator P(t) defined in Eq. (36) and the 

relations 

!>,,Â£,, = 0, Tr ? Â£ ? = 0, Tr l] C tj {t) = 0, Tr^C^t) = 0,

C^ = i{H v ,*} PB , C n (t)* = i{H n {t),*} pB , (41) 

Â£(* = i{H ( ,*} pB , Â£(-(*)* = /{Hf(*),*} M , 

as is easily proved, the Liouvillian C appearing inside the time integration in Eq. (39) is 
replaced by C cou â\ defined by C cou âi* = {H cou âi, * }pb and Eq. (39) is reduced to

Expressing p s (t) and P(t) in terms of pti(t) and pAi), and operating Ify and Tr? on Eq. (39), 
one obtains a coupled master equation 

p n (l) = -i[Â£ri + Cti(t)]pii(t)-iTr s [Â£q + Â£ C01ip i\g(t,ti)p c (ti)

where Â£ A (f)* = {H A (f), *}pb- The first (instantaneous) term describes the reversible motion 
of the relevant and irrelevant systems while the second and third terms bring on irreversibility. 
The coupled master equation (43) is still equivalent to the original Liouville equation (28) 
and can describe a variety of dynamics of the bundle of trajectories. In comparison with 
the usual time-independent projection operator method of Nakajima-Zwanzig (68) (69) 
where the irrelevant distribution function p^ is assumed to be a stationary heat bath, the 
present coupled-master equation (43) is rich enough to study the microscopic origin of the 
large-amplitude dissipative motion. 

2.2 Dynamical response and correlation functions 

As was discussed in Sec. 3.1.2 and Ref.(22), a bundle of trajectories even in the two degrees 
of freedom system may reach a statistical object. In this case, it is reasonable to assume that 
the effects on the relevant system coming from the irrelevant one are mainly expressed by 
an averaged effect over the irrelevant distribution function (Assumption). Namely, the effects 
due to the fluctuation part H A (t) are assumed to be much smaller than those coming from 
Haver(t). Under this assumption, one may introduce the mean- eld propagator 

g mf (t,t>) = Texpl-iJ[l-P(T)]C m f(T)dT\, (44a) 

C m f(t)=cf(t) + C" ? ' f (t), (44b) 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 69 

Cf(t) = Â£,+Â£,(*), (44c) 

Cf(t) = ^ + C s (t), (44d) 

which describes the major time evolution of the system, while the fluctuation part is regarded 
as a perturbation. By further introducing the following propagators given by 

G mf {t,t') = Texp I -i f C'"f{T)dT I = G v (t,t')G ? {t,t'), (44a) 

G,,{t, t') = Texp I -i [ Câ¢ f {x)dx \ , (44b) 

G ? {t,t') = Texp 1 -i [ Â£â¢ f (r)dT \ , (44c) 

one may prove that there holds a relation 

g mf {t,T)C A (T)p v (T)p^(T) = G mf (t,T)C A {T)p l ,{T)p ? {T). (45) 

The coupling interaction is generally expressed as 

H coupl ( 1 ]^)=^A l (n)B 1 ^). (46) 

; 

For simplicity, we hereafter discard the summation / in the coupling. By introducing the 
generalized two-time correlation and response functions, which have been called dynamical 
correlation and response functions in Ref. (21), through 

4>{t,T) = Tr^(r,t)B - (B- < B > t )p ( (r), (47) 

X (t,r) = Tr ? {G ? (r,t)B,B} pB p ? (r), (48) 

with < B >f= Tr?Bp?(t), the master equation in Eq.(43) for the relevant degree of freedom is 
expressed as 

p,,{t) = -i[C^ + C 7 ,(t)]p v (t)-iTr s [C v + C C0Uf ,i]g(t,ti)pc(t I )

when the irrelevant system approaches very near to its stationary state (, i.e., the irrelevant 



70 Chaotic Systems 

system is very near to the statistical state where one may safely make the assumption to be 
stated in next subsection). In order to analyze what happens in the microscopic system which 
is situated far from its stationary states, one has to study xihih â t) and cp(t[,t[ â t) by 
changing t j. Since both x(^l> t ; â t) and (p(t ;, t ; â t) are strongly dependent on t[, it is not 
easy to explore the dynamical evolution of the system far from the stationary state. So as to 
make Eq.(49) applicable, we will exploit the further assumptions. 

2.3 Macroscopic transport equation 

In this subsection, we discuss how the macroscopic transport equation is obtained from the 
fully microscopic master equation (49) by clearly itemizing necessary microscopic conditions. 

Condition I Suppose the relevant distribution function p^(t â t) inside the time 

integration in Eq. (49) evolves through the mean-field Hamiltonian Hâ + Hâ (t ) . Namely, 
Pii(t â t) inside the integration is assumed to be expressed as pâ (t) = Gâ(t,t â T)pâ(t â t), 
so that Eq.(49) is reduced to 



p n (t) = -i[C,, + C v (t)]p v (t) - iTr l \C n + C CBup i]g(t,ti)pc{ti)

o 

t-ti 
+ J ^(f,f-T){A,{G ); (t,f-T)A,p,(()} PB } pr (50) 

o 

This condition is equivalent to Assumption discussed in the previous subsection, because 
the fluctuation effects are sufficiently small and are able to be treated as a perturbation 
around the path generated by the mean-field Hamiltonian H,j + H,j(t), and are sufficient 
to be retained in Eq. (50) up to the second order. 

Condition II Suppose the irrelevant distribution function pAi) has already reached its 
time-independent stationary state p? (to)- According to our previous paper(22), this 
situation is able to be well realized even in the 2-degrees of freedom system. Under this 
assumption, the relevant mean-field Liouvillian Câ + C,,(t) becomes a time independent 
object. Under this assumption, a time ordered integration in Gâ(t, t') defined in Eq. (44) is 
performed and one may introduce 

G 1? (f,f-T)Â«G, / (T) = exp{-fÂ£;;' / -r}, C",' f = C^ + C,,(t ), (51) 

where fo denotes a time when the irrelevant system has reached its stationary state. 

Condition III Suppose the irrelevant time scale is much shorter than the relevant time 
scale. Under this assumption, the response x(t/ 1 â t) and correlation functions <p(t, t â x) 
are regarded to be independent of the time f, because t in Eq.(50) is regarded to describe a

This condition is different from the diabatic condition(17; 19), where the ratio between 
the characteristic times of the irrelevant degrees of freedom and of the relevant one is 
considered arbitrary small. However this condition is only partly satisfied for the most 
realistic cases. The dissipation is necessarily connected to some degree of chaoticity of the 
overall dynamics of the system(28). 

Here it should be noted that such one-time response and correlation functions are still different 
from the usual ones introduced in the LRT where the concepts of linear coupling and of heat 
bath are adopted. Under the same assumption, the upper limit of the integration t â l\ in Eq. 
(53) can be extended to the infinity, because the x( T ) an( A <K T ) are assumed to be very fast 
damping functions when it is measured in the relevant time scale.

This equation is a Fokker-Planck type equation. The first term on the right-hand side of Eq. 
(57) represents the contribution from the mean-field part, and the second term a contribution 



72 Chaotic Systems 

from the correlated part of the distribution function at time t\. The last three terms represent 
contribution from the dynamical fluctuation effects H^. The friction as well as fluctuation 
terms are supposed to emerge as a result of those three terms. We will discuss the role of each 
term with our numerical simulation in the next section. 

At the end of this subsection, let us discuss how to obtain the Langevin equation from our 
fully microscopic coupled master equation, because it has been regarded as a final goal of 
the microscopic or dynamical approaches to justify the phenomenological approaches. For a 
sake of simplicity, let us discuss a case where the interaction between relevant and irrelevant 
degrees of freedom has the following linear form, 

H C0M p! = AQX>, i-e. A=V\Q, B = VX^qu (58a) 

i i 

Q = ^(n + >f), P = ^(n*-n), (58b) 

Ri = â !=(& + $), Pi = -j=($-Zi). (58c) 

Here, we assume that the relevant system consists of one degree of freedom described by 
P, Q. Even though we apply the linear coupling form, the generalization for the case with 
more general nonlinear coupling is straightforward. In order to evaluate Eq. (57), one has to 
calculate 

Q(t) = exp(-icfr)Q, (59) 

where Q(t) is a phase space image of Q through the backward evolution. Thus the Poisson 
bracket {Q(t),jO^ (Â£)}pb in Eq. (57) is expressed as

As discussed in Ref . (26), Eq. (62) results in the Langevin equation with a form 

by introducing a concept of mechanical temperature. 

The above derivation of the Langevin equation is still too formal to be applicable for the 
general cases. However it might be naturally expected that the Conditions I, II and III are 
met in the actual dynamical processes. 

3. Dynamic realization of transport phenomenon in finite system 

In order to study the dissipation process microscopically, it is inevitable to treat a system with 
more than two degrees of freedom, which is able to be divided into two weakly coupled 
subsystems: one is composed of at least two degrees of freedom and is regarded as an 
irrelevant system, whereas the rest is considered as a relevant system. The system with two 
degrees of freedom is too simple to assign the relevant degree of freedom nor to discuss its 
dissipation, because the chaotic or statistical state can be realized by a system with at least two 
degrees of freedom. 

3.1 The case of the system with three degrees of freedom 
3.1.1 Description of the microscopic system 

The system considered in our numerical calculation is composed of a collective degree of 
freedom coupled to intrinsic degrees of freedom through weak interaction, which simulates a 
nuclear system. The collective system describing, e.g., the giant resonance is represented by 
the harmonic oscillator given by 

H v (q,p) = ^ + lMcv 2 q 2 . (64) 

and the intrinsic system mimicking the hot nucleus is described by the modified SU(3) model 
Hamiltonian (70) given by 

2 -, 2 N 

H = Â£ e,K u + - Â£ V- { K l0 K, + h.c.}; K tj = Â£ Cj m C jm (65) 

1=0 i=l m=\ 

where Cj and C,â, represent the fermion creation and annihilation operators. There are three 
N-fold degenerate levels with cq < e\ < e 2 . In the case with an even N particle system, the 
TDHF theory gives a classical Hamiltonian with two degrees of freedom as 

Hj(<?i,Pi,<?2,P2) = ^1 - e oH<?i + Pi) + 2 V ^ N ~ W*? _ Pi)

In our numerical calculation, the used parameters are M=18.75, cv =0.0064, Â£o=0, Â£\=1, Â£2=2, 
N=30 and V,=-0.07. In this case, the collective time scale t co ; characterized by the harmonic 
oscillator in Eq. (64) and the intrinsic time scale t, h characterized by the harmonic part of the 
intrinsic Hamiltonian in Eq.(66) satisfies a relation t co ; ~ 10t,â. 
For the coupling interaction, we use the following nonlinear interaction given by

i=l 



f 1 

H C oupl = Hq - <?o) 2 E {qf + pf \ â  (67) 



A physical meaning of introducing a quantity qg in Eq. (67) will be discussed at the end of this 
subsection as well as the next subsection. 

In performing the numerical simulation, the time evolution of the distribution function p(t) is 
evaluated by using the pseudo-particle method as: 

1 N P 2 

?(0 = wL ll%i - %n(t))Kvi - Pw,(*)) â  Kq - qâ(t))s( P - Pn (t)), (68) 

N P n = \ i=l 

where Nâ means the total number of pseudo-particles. The distribution function in Eq. (68) 
defines an ensemble of the system, each member of which is composed of a collective degree 
of freedom coupled to a single intrinsic trajectory. The collective coordinates Cjn{t) an d Pn(t), 
and the intrinsic coordinates (?;,n(t) and p;, n (Â£) determine a phase space point of the n-th 
pseudo-particle at time t, whose time dependence is described by the canonical equations 
of motion given by

H = H,,{q,p) +H^(qi,pi,q 2 ,p2) + H coupl (69c) 

We use the fourth order simplectic Runge-Kutta method(75; 76) for integrating the canonical 
equations of motion and Np is chosen to be 10,000. The initial condition for the intrinsic 
distribution function is given by a uniform distribution in a tiny region of the stochastic sea 
as stated in Ref. (22). That for the collective distribution function is given by the 3 function 
centered at q(0) = and p(0), p(0) being defined by a given collective energy E,j together 
with q(0) = 0. The distribution function in Eq. (68) defines an ensemble of the system, each 
member of which is composed of a collective degree of freedom coupled to a single intrinsic 
trajectory. 

In our numerical simulation, the coupling interaction is not activated at an initial stage. In the 
beginning, the coupling between the collective and intrinsic systems is switch off, and they 
evolve independently. Namely, the collective system evolves regularly, whereas, as discussed 
in the subsection 3.1.2, the intrinsic system tends to reach its time-independent stationary state 
(chaotic object). After the statistical state has been realized in the intrinsic system, the coupling 
interaction is activated. A quantity qg in Eq.(67) denotes a value of the collective trajectory q 
at the switch on time. A purpose of introducing qg is to insert the coupling adiabatically, and 
to conserve the total energy before and after the switch on time. (Hereafter, r sw denotes the 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 75 

moment when the interaction is switch on, and in our numerical calculation r sw is set to be 
t sw = 12t co/ ). 

Here it is worthwhile to discuss why we let the two systems evolve independently at the 
initial stage. As is well known, the ergodic and irreversible property of the intrinsic system 
is assumed in the conventional approach, and the intrinsic system for the in nite system 
is usually represented by the time independent canonical ensemble. In the nite system, 
however, one has to explore whether or not the intrinsic system tends to reach such a state 
that is effectively replaced by a statistical object, how it evolves after the coupling interaction 
is switch on, and what its final state looks like. 

As is discussed at the end of the subsection 2.2, it is not easy to apply Eq. (49) for analyzing 
what happens in the dynamical microscopic system which is in the general situation. Our 
present primarily aim is to microscopically generate such a transport phenomenon that might 
be understood in terms of the Langevin equation. Namely, we have to construct such a 
microscopic situation that seems to satisfy the Condition I, II and III discussed in subsection 
2.3. In this context, we firstly let the intrinsic system reach a chaotic situation in a dynamical 
way, till the ergodic and irreversible property are well realized dynamically. In the next 
subsection, it will be shown that above microscopic situation is indeed realized dynamically 
for the intrinsic system (66). 

3.1.2 Dynamic realization of statistical state in finite system 

It is not a trivial discussion how to dynamically characterize the statistical state in the 
finite system. Even though the Hamilton system shows chaotic situation and the Lyapunov 
exponent has a positive value everywhere in the phase space, there still remain a lot of 
questions, such as, whether or not one may substantiate statistical state in the way dynamical 
chaos is structured in real Hamiltonian system, how the real macroscopic motion looks like in 
such system, whether or not there are some difficulties of using the properties of dynamical 
chaos as a source of randomness, whether or not there is difference between real Hamiltonian 
chaos and a conventional understanding of the laws of statistical physics and whether or 
not the system dynamically reaches some statistical object. It is certainly interesting question 
especially for the nuclear physics to explore the relation between the dynamical definition 
of the statistical state and the static definition of it. The former definition will be discussed 
in the following, whereas the latter definition is usually given by employing a concept of 
"temperature" like 

p = e-P H , /S=jl. (70) 

Even in the nuclear system, there are many phenomena well explained by using the concept 
of temperature. To make the discussion simple, we treat the Hamilton system given in Eq. 
(66). In Fig. 4, the Poincare section for the case with N = 30, Â£q = 0, e\ = 1, Â£2 = 2, 
V\ = V2 = â0.07 and E = 40 is illustrated. From this figure, one may see that the phase 
space is dominated by a chaotic sea, with some remnants of KAM torus(71). The toughness of 
the torus structure is a quite general property in the Hamilton system. Since the KAM torus 
means an existence of a very sticky motion which travels around the torus for a quite long 
time, one might expect a very long correlation time which would prevent us from introducing 
some statistical objects. 

As is well known, the nearest-neighbor level-spacing statistics of the quantum system is 
well described by the GOE, when the phase space of its classical correspondent is covered 
by a chaotic sea(39). Here it should be remembered that the GOE is derived under the 



76 Chaotic Systems 

assumption that the matrix elements of Hamiltonian should be representation independent^!). 
This assumption would be considered to be a statistical ansatz introduced for the quantum 
system. Let us consider the classical analogue of the quantum concept of representation 
independence. We repeatedly point out an importance of the choice of coordinate system, 
because it has shown to be very useful in exploring how simply the trajectory under discussion 
is described, how to obtain its approximate constants of motion, how optimally the total 
system is divided into the relevant and irrelevant subsystems for a given trajectory and how 
analytically one may understand an exceedingly rich structure of the phase space. In a case of 
the chaotic situation where no constants of motion exist except for the total energy, however, 
there should be no dynamical reason to select some specific coordinate system. In other 
words, the classical statistical state is expected to be characterized by the coordinate system 
independence. 

The coordinate system {c\\,p\,c\i,Vl\ used in describing the Hamilton system in Eq. (66) 
just corresponds to the maximal-decoupled coordinate system, because it satisfies the 
maximum-decoupling condition (27). The coordinate system {q\, p\,qi, Vl} is identified to be 
the optimum coordinate system, when an amplitude of the trajectory is sufficiently small and 
the harmonic term in Eq. (66) is dominated. When the amplitude becomes large, there appears 
such a situation for the bundle of trajectories, where the following relations are fulfilled, 

<q,>t < ^/{q}- < q~i >?),, (71a) 

< Pi >t < \j{vh < Pi >?>r {i = 1<2} (71b) 

with 

< A > t = / / / / dqidpidq 2 dp 2 Ap(t). (72) 



In this case, the coordinate system {q\, p\, qi, p 2 } looses its particular advantage in describing 
the bundle of trajectories under discussion. When there realizes a stationary state satisfying 

| <(? , >t=0 , *(rf-< ft >?) r o, etc, (73) 

Equation (71) is considered to be a dynamical condition to characterize the system to be in the 
statistical object, because the system does not show any regularity associated with a certain 
specific coordinate system. In other words, the system has dynamically reached such a state 
that is coordinate system independent. 

In Fig. 6, the time dependence of the variance < piâ < p\ >> of the momentum for the first 
degree of freedom is shown for the cases with E = 40 and V = â0.01, â0.04 and â0.07. Aunit 
of time is given by X\ = oj\/2n, where W\ is an eigen frequency of low-lying normal mode 
obtained by applying the RPA to Eq. (65). In the case with V = â0.01 where the whole phase 
space is covered by the regular motions illustrated in Fig. 1, the variance is oscillating and its 
amplitude is increasing. In the case with a much stronger interaction V = â0.04, the variance 
increases exponentially and then oscillates around some saturated value. Since the amplitude 
of oscillation is not small, a stationary state is not expected to be realized for a very long time. 
Note that the Poincare section map for the case with V = â0.04 is still dominated by many 
kinds of island structure like the case with V = â0.01. Even though an initial distribution 
is chosen around the unstable fixed point where many trajectories with different characters 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 



77 



come across with each other, domination of the KAM torus in the Poincare section prevents 
the system from reaching some statistical object.

In the case of V = â0.07, where the overwhelming region of the Poincare section map is 
covered by the chaotic sea as is depicted in Fig. 4, a quite different situation is realized. As is 
observed in Fig. 6, the time dependence of the variance of pi almost dies out around T ~ 25tj. 
In Fig. 7, the averaged value < P2 > an d its variance < p\â < pi > > for the second degree 
of freedom are shown for the case with V = â0.07. Since < fi > has reached null value 
around T ~ 30tj and the variance become almost constant around T ~ 25t^ like < p 2 â < 
pi > >, the system is considered to be in a stationary statistical state where the relation in 
Eqs. (71) and (73) are well realized at around T ~ 30ti. In this case, the choice of a particular 



78 Chaotic Systems 

coordinate system does not have any profit for the present the system with V = â0.07, like 
the quantum system described by GOE. 

Another information on the dynamic realization of the statistical state might be obtained 
from the two-time dynamic response Xlm(t> T )> X/ m (f, t) and correlation functions (pi, n (t,x), 
<&l m (t, t) defined in Eqs. (47) and (48). Suppose the system described by a bundle of 
trajectories has been developed exactly till t ; following the original Liouville equation (28) or 
equivalently by the coupled-master equation (43). The approximate coupled master equations 
in Eqs. (49), which depend on the two-time dynamic response and correlation functions, are 
derived from Eq. (43) under the assumption that the effects coming from the fluctuation 
H^(t) are sufficiently small so as to be evaluated by the second order perturbation theory. 
Consequently, Eqs. (49) is considered to be applicable either in a case with very small 
fluctuation effects or in a case with a very short time interval x = t â tj just after tj. When one 
evaluates the t\ dependence of the dynamic response and correlation functions 

Xlmih + tAi), <pl m (tl + T,ti), X hn {tj + T,tl), *!â(*/ H-T^j), (74) 

one may study how their T-dependence change as a function of t\. Since the dynamic 
response and correlation functions depend on the time derivative of < q? â < qi >}>/ their 
fj-independence gives a more severe stationary condition than the condition (73). 
When p(t) reaches some stationary state after a long time-evolution through the original 
Liouville equation, the dynamic response and correlation functions show no t /-dependence so 
as to be approximated by the usual one-time response and correlation functions appeared in 
the LRT. According to the recent work(22), it turned out that a dynamic realization of statistical 
state is established around f j ~ 50ti for the system described by the Hamiltonian in Eq. (66) 
with V = -0.07. 

3.1.3 Energy interchange between the collective and intrinsic systems 

Our attention is mainly focused on examining the energy interchange between these two 
systems, and what final states these two systems can reach and their interaction-dependence. 
For studying the energy interchange, we make numerical calculation for the following cases: 
The collective energy is much larger, comparable and much smaller than the intrinsic energy. 
Namely, the collective energy is chosen to be Eâ = 20, 40 and 60, whereas the intrinsic 
energy is fixed at Eg = 40. Here E^ = 40 is chosen, because the phase space of the intrinsic 
system is almost covered by the chaotic sea at this energy. In order to examine the interaction 
dependence of the final state, the interaction strength parameter A is chosen to be 0.005 
(relatively weak), 0.01 and 0.02 (relatively strong). 

Figures 8 (a)-(d) show the time-dependent averaged values of the partial Hamiltonian {H,j}, 
(Hf) and {H cou âi) and the total Hamiltonian (H) defined through 

r 2 

(X) = / Xp{t)dqdpY\dqid Vi , (75) 

J i=i 

for the case with Â£, ? = 40. One may see that the main change occurs in the collective energy 
as well as the interaction energy, but not in the intrinsic energy. 

When one precisely looks for the independent trajectories of the bundle, the collective, 
intrinsic and interaction energies of each trajectory are changing in time in accordance with 
the usual Hamilton system. Since the intrinsic system has already reached some stochastic

state when the interaction is switch on, a time-dependence of the intrinsic energy for each 
trajectory is canceled out when one takes an average over many trajectories of the bundle. For 
a case with small interaction strength (A = 0.005), the collective energy oscillates for a long 
time and seems not to reach any saturated value. In a case with a relatively large interaction 
strength (A ~0.02), it will reach some time-independent value. 

Figures 9 (a) and (b) represent the numerical results for the cases with Eq = 20 and 60, showing 
almost the same result as for the case with Eq = 40. 

From the above numerical simulation, one may see that the energy is dissipated from the 
collective to an 'environment', when the intrinsic system and the coupling interaction are 
regarded as an 'environment'. Before understanding the above energy transfer in terms of 
the phenomenological Langevin equation, it is important to microscopically explore what 
happens in the intrinsic system when the collective system is attached to the intrinsic system 
through the coupling interaction. 

In Fig. 10, a time dependence of the variance of the intrinsic momentum < p^ > is shown. The 
other intrinsic variances < q\ >, < q\ > and < ipi > show almost the same time dependence 
as in Fig. 10. As discussed in our previous paper(22), an appearance of some chaotic state is 
expected when the variance has reached its stationary value. Since the variance of the intrinsic

system reaches some stationary value before t sw and since the intrinsic system is regarded to 
be in the chaotic state, the coupling interaction is activated at t sw in our simulation. After 
T sw = 12t co /, its value remains almost the same for the small interaction strength case, and 
reaches quickly a little bit larger stationary value for the large coupling strength case (A = 
0.02). This small increase corresponds to a slight enlargement of the chaotic sea in the intrinsic 
phase space. Practically, the values of variances are regarded to be constant before and after

From our numerical simulation, one may deduce such a conclusion that the intrinsic system 
even with only two degrees of freedom can be treated as a time independent statistical object 
before and after the coupling interaction is activated. This conclusion provide us with the 
dynamical foundation for understanding the statistical ansatz adopted in the conventional 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 81 

transport theory, where the irrelevant system is always regarded as a time-independent 
statistical object. 

Since the variance has reached its stationary value shortly after t sw , it is reasonable to 
introduce the following time independent quantity: 



r 2 
< P? + <? 2 >= / Yl d Pi d V{r} + tf}p(t) (76)

Except for the effects coming from the fluctuation part H&(t), the collective trajectory is 
supposed to be described by the mean field Hamiltonian in Eq. (77) after the coupling 
interaction is switch on. The solution of Eq. (77) is expressed as 

q = Acosco(t â r S w), p = â McoAsmcv(t â t sw ), (78)

result. As is clearly recognized from Fig. 11 and Eq. (81), the mean field description can 
well reproduce the oscillating property (the amplitude, the central energy of the oscillation 
as well as the frequency) of the collective energy < Hq >, whereas it can not reproduce a 
reduction mechanism of the amplitude. That is the mean field Hamiltonian can not describe 
the dissipation process. More precisely, one may see that the mean-field approximation 
provides us with a decisive information on the following two points: (a) the amplitude A of 
the collective energy is mainly determined by the coupling interaction strength A as well as the 
averaged properties of the intrinsic system (Y^ = i p\ + <J?)/ (b) the frequency u> is related with 
the characteristic frequency of the collective oscillator cvq, the coupling interaction strength 
A and the averaged properties of intrinsic system (Xj=i p 2 + q 2 )- From the above discussion

same as Fig. 8(c). 

and from Figs.l and 2, the dissipation process should be attributed to the fluctuation effects 
coming from H^ . 



3.1.4 Analysis with a phenomenological transport equation 

Before discussing the microscopic dynamics responsible for the damping and diffusion 
process, let us apply the phenomenological transport equation to our present simulated 
process. Let us suppose that the collective motion will be subject to both a friction force and 
a random force, and can be described by the Langevin equation. A simple Langevin equation 
is given by 

dU m f{q) 



Mq + 



dq 



+ 74 = /(0/ 



(82) 



where U m * (q) represents the potential part of H,, + Hâ (t) in Eq. (77) and 7 the friction strength 
parameter. A function f(t) represents the random force and, in our calculation, it is taken to 
be the Gaussian white noise characterized by the following moments: 



</(*)> =0, (f(t)f(s))=kTS(t-s). 



(83) 



The numerical result for Eq. (82) is shown in Fig. 12 with the parameters 7=0.0033 and 
fcT=1.45. The used parameters appearing in \l m > (q) is the same as in Fig. 8 (c). 
As is understood from Fig. 12, the Langevin equation do reproduce the energy transfer from 
the collective system to the environment quite well. This means that our dynamical simulation 
shown in Fig. 8 is satisfactory linked with the conventional transport equation, and our 
schematic model Hamiltonian introduced by Eqs. (64), (66) and (67) is successfully considered 
as a dynamical analogue of the Brownian particle coupled with the classical statistical system. 
Based on the above analogy and on Eqs. (57) and (82), one may learn the collective degree 
of freedom is subject to both an average force coming from the mean field Hamiltonian in

Fig. 12. Time-dependence of average collective energy simulated with Langevin equation 
(82) with 7=0.0033 and kT=1.45. Parameters used in the mean-field potential is the same as 
Fig. 8(c). 

Eq. (77) and the fluctuation term H^. Namely, the fluctuation H^ described by the last 
three terms on the right hand side of Eq. (57) is responsible for not only the damping of 
the oscillation amplitude but also for the dissipative energy flow from the collective system to 
the environment. 

At the end of this subsection, it should be noticed that our choice of 7 and kT does not satisfy 
the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This means that our simulated dissipative phenomenon 
is not the same as the usual damping phenomena described within the LRT. Since our 
simulated dissipation phenomenon is induced not by the linear coupling but by the nonlinear 
coupling, there still remain interesting questions for comprehensively understanding the 
macroscopic transport phenomena. 

3.1.5 Microscopic origin of damping and diffusion mechanism 

In the Langevin equation, there are two important forces, the friction force and the random 
force. The former describes the average effect on the collective degree of freedom causing 
an irreversible dissipation, while the latter the diffusion of it. According to the parameter 
values adopted in our Langevin simulation in Fig. 12, it is naturally expected that the 
dissipative-diffusion mechanism plays a crucial role in reducing the oscillation amplitude of 
collective energy, and in realizing the steadily energy flow from the collective system to the 
environment. 

In order to explore this point, a time development of the collective distribution function pâ (t) 
is shown in Figs. 13 and 14 for two cases with A=0.005 (small coupling strength) and 0.02 
(large coupling strength), respectively. In Figs. 13(a) and 14(a), it is illustrated how a shape 
of the distribution function p t j(t) in the collective phase space disperses depending on time. 
In these figures, an effect of the friction force ought to be observed when a location of the 
distribution function changes from the outside (higher energy) region to the inside (lower 
energy) region of the phase space. On the other hand, a dissipative diffusion mechanism is

Let us discuss a relation between the reduction mechanism in the amplitude of collective 
energy and the dispersing property of pij{t). Suppose pij{t) does not show any strong disperse 
property by almost keeping its original J-function shape, in this case, the effects coming from 
H&(t) is considered to be small. The collective part of each trajectory has a time dependence 
expressed in Eq. (78) and its collective energy Hâ has a time dependence given by Eq. (81).

with Langevin equation (82) with 7=0.0033 and kT=1.45. The parameters used in mean-field 
potential is the same as Fig. 8(c) 

Since there is a well developed coherence among the trajectories in p-n(t) when A = 0.005, the 
averaged collective energy < Hâ > over the bundle of trajectories still has a time dependence 
given by Eq. (81). Consequently, one may not expect a reduction of the oscillation amplitude 
in the collective energy as is shown in Fig. 8(a). 

When the distribution function tends to expand over the whole ring shape, the collective part 
of each trajectory is not expected to have the same time dependence as in Eq. (78). This is 
due to the effects coming from the stochastic force H^ (t ), and some trajectories have a chance 
to have an advanced phase whereas other trajectories have a retarded phase in comparison 
with the phase in Eq. (78). According to the decoherent effects coming from H&(t), the time 
dependence of the collective energy for the each trajectory in Eq. (78) cancels out due to the 
randomness of the phases when one takes an average over the bundle of trajectories. This 
dephasing mechanism is induced by H^(t), and is considered to be the microscopic origin of 
the damping, i.e. the energy transfer from the collective system to the environment. 
In order to compare the above mechanism with what happens in the phenomenological 
transport equation, the solution of the Langevin equation represented in the collective phase 
space is shown in Fig. 15 for the cases with 7=0.0033 and JcT=1.45. From this figure, one may 
understand that the damping (a change of the distribution from the outside to the inside of the 
phase space) as well as the diffusion (an expansion of the distribution) are taking place so as to 
reproduce the numerical result in Fig. 12. Even though the Langevin equation gives almost the 
same result as in Fig.8 in the macroscopic-level, as is recognized by comparing Figs. 13 and 14 
with Fig. 15, there are substantial differences in the microscopic-level dynamics. Namely, the 
distribution function pn(t) of our simulation evolves into the whole ring shape with staying 
almost the same initial energy region of the phase space, while the solution of the Langevin 
equation evolves to a round shape with covering the whole energetically allowed region. In 
the case of the Langevin simulation, the dissipation and dephasing mechanisms are seemed 
to contribute to reproduce the result in Fig. 12, while the dephasing mechanism is essential 
for the damping of the collective energy in our microscopic simulation. 

Here, it is worthwhile mentioning that the decoherence or dephasing process due to the 
interaction with the environment has also been discussed in the quantum system(13; 73). 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 87 

3.2 The Case of the system with multi-degree of freedom 

As shown in last section, it has been clarified that the main damping mechanism(30) of the 
collective motion nonlinearly coupled with the intrinsic system composed by two degrees of 
freedom is dephasing caused by the chaoticity of intrinsic system. Here, it should be noted that 
the dephasing process only appears under the nonlinear coupling interaction, specially for 
the small number of degrees of freedom, as in a case of the quantum dynamical system(13). 
It was also found that the collective distribution function organized by the Liouville equation 
and that by the phenomenological Langevin equation show quite different structure in the 
collective phase space, even though they give almost the same macro-level description for the 
averaged property of the collective motion. 

Now we are facing the questions as how to understand such the difference between two 
descriptions, and in what condition we can expect the same microscopic situation as the 
Langevin equation described and when the fluctuation-dissipation theorem comes true. In 
fact, underlying the conventional approach to the Fokker-Planck- or Langevin-type equation, 
the intrinsic subsystem is considered with large (or say, in nite) number of degrees of freedom 
placed in an initial state of canonical equilibrium. So, for understanding the fundamental 
background of phenomenological transport equation and the basis of dissipation-dissipation 
relation, there still remain interesting questions for comprehensively understanding the effect, 
which changes depending on the number of degrees of freedom of intrinsic system. 
For this purpose, we will use a Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) system for describing the intrinsic 
system, which allows us more conveniently to change the number of degrees of freedom of 
intrinsic system. It will be shown that dephasing mechanism is the main mechanism for small 
number degrees of freedom (say, two) case. When the number of degrees of freedom becomes 
relative large (say, eight or more), the diffusion mechanism will start to play the role and the 
energy transport process can be divided into three regimes, such as a dephasing regime, a 
statistical relaxation regime, and an equilibrium regime. By examining the time evolution of 
entropy with using the nonextensive thermodynamics in Sec. 4, we will find that an existence 
of three regimes is clearly shown. 

Under the help of analytical analysis carried in Sec. 5, we will also show that for the case with 
relative large number of degrees of freedom, the energy transport process can be described 
by the generalized Fokker-Planck- and Langevin-type equation, and a phenomenological 
Fluctuation-Dissipation relation is satisfied. For the finite system, the intrinsic system plays 
the role as a finite heat bath with finite correlation time and the statistical relaxation is 
anomalous diffusion. Only for the intrinsic system with very large number of degrees of 
freedom, the dynamical description and conventional transport approach may provide almost 
the same macro- and micro-level mechanisms. 

3.2.1 ^-fermi-pasta-Ulam (FPU) system 

The collective subsystem, for simplicity and without any lose of generality, is represented by 
a harmonic oscillator as the case of the system with three degrees of freedom as Eq. (64). The 
intrinsic subsystem, mimicking the environment, is described by a f> Fermi-Pasta-Ulam (FPU) 
system (sometime called /3-FPU system, as with quadrtic interaction), which was posed in the 



88 Chaotic Systems 

famous paper (49) and reviewed in (74):

q = ^(v + y% v = A={n* -n)> ( 85a ) 

<fc = -^=(& + ff), Pi = -^(f*-fO, (' = 1/",^} (85b) 

IV(j represents the number of degrees of freedom (i.e., the number of nonlinear oscillators). 
According to the related literatures(26; 48; 74), the dynamics of /3-FPU becomes strongly 
chaotic and relaxation is fast, when the energy per DOF e is chosen to be larger than a certain 
value (called as the critical value(48), say e c ~ 0.1). In the this thesis, e is chosen as 10 to 
guarantee that our irrelevant subsystem can reach fully chaotic situation. Indeed, in this 
case, the calculated largest Lyapunov exponent cr(N^) turns out to be positive, for instance 
c(Nd) =0.15, 0.11, and 0.11 for Nj =1, 4, and 8, respectively. Thus, a "fully developed chaos" 
is expected for the /3-FPU system, and an appearance of statistical behavior in its chain of 
oscillators and an energy equipartition among the modes are expected to be realized. 
For the coupling interaction, we use the following nonlinear interaction given by 



H-coupl "- 



{<? 2 -<?o}{<?i-<?lo}- (86) 



A physical meaning of introducing the quantities tfo and q\ q in Eq. (86) is discussed in Sec. 
3.1.1 and our previous paper(30). Such the choice of the coupling interaction form means 
that c\\ is considered as a doorway variable, through which the intrinsic subsystem exerts its 
influence on the collective subsystem(26). It should be pointed out that the form of coupling 
interaction in Eq. (86) is a little bit different from the one used in our previous paper(30) 
since here we want to treat the collective and doorway variables in a more parallel way. 
The numerical comparison between this two forms shows there is no substantial differences 
between these two forms on the final results. 

As discussed in Sec. 3.1.1, the time evolution of the distribution function p(t) is evaluated by 
using the pseudo-particle method as:

pW = w E Ft Km - %n{t))Kvi - vU*)) 

JV P n=l 1=1 

â S(q-q n (t))5(p-pâ(t)), (87) 

where Nv means the total number of pseudo-particles. The distribution function in Eq. (87) 
defines an ensemble of the system, each member of which is composed of a collective degree 
of freedom coupled to a single intrinsic trajectory. The collective coordinates Cjn{t) an d Pn(t), 
and the intrinsic coordinates C]i n (t) and p,- â (t ) {i = 1, â  â  â  , Nd } determine a phase space point

of the n-th pseudo-particle at time t, whose time dependence is described by the canonical 
equations of motion given by 

(88) 

We use the fourth order simplectic Runge-Kutta algorithm(75; 76) for integrating the canonical 
equations of motion and Np is chosen to be 10,000. In our study, the coupling strength 
parameter is chosen as A ~ 0.002. 

3.2.2 Energy dissipation and equipartition 

We have discussed a microscopic dynamical system with three degrees of freedom in Sec. 
3.1.3, 3.1.4 and 3.1.5, and shown that the dephasing mechanism induced by fluctuation 
mechanism turned out to be responsible for the energy transfer from collective subsystem 
to environment(30). In that case, as we shown, the fluctuation-dissipation relation does not 
hold and there is substantial difference in the microscopic behaviors between the microscopic 
dynamical simulation based on the Liouville equation and the phenomenological transport 
equation even if these two descriptions provide almost same macroscopic behaviors. Namely, 
the collective distribution function organized by the Liouville equation evolves into the whole 
ring shape with staying almost the same initial energy region of the phase space, while 
the solution of the Langevin equation evolves to a round shape, whose collective energy is 
ranging from the initial value to zero. 

For answering the questions as how to understand the above stated differences, and 
in what condition where the microscopic descriptions by the Langevin equation and by 
the Liouville equation give the same results and in what physical situation where the 
fluctuation-dissipation theorem comes true, a naturally extension of our work(30) is to 
considered the effects of the number of degrees of freedom in intrinsic subsystem because no 
matter how our simulated dissipation phenomenon is obtained by a simplest system which is 
composed of only three degrees of freedom, as described in Sec. 3.1. 

In our numerical calculation, the used parameters are M=l, CO =0.2. In this case, the collective 
time scale t co ; characterized by the harmonic oscillator in Eq. (64) and the intrinsic time 
scale t,â characterized by the harmonic part of the intrinsic Hamiltonian in Eq.(84) satisfies 
a relation t co ; ;Â» T; n . The switch-on time T szv is set to be t sw = 100t co ; 

Figures 16 (a-d) show the time-dependent averaged values of the partial Hamiltonian (Hâ), 
(Hf ) and (H coup i) and the total Hamiltonian (H) for the case with E n = 30, A=0.002, N d =2, 4, 
8 and 16, respectively. The definition of ensemble average is the same as Eq. (75). 
In order to show how the dissipation of the collective energy changes depending on the 
number of degrees of freedom in intrinsic subsystem, the time-dependent averaged values 
of the partial Hamiltonian (Hâ) are also shown in Fig. 17 for the cases with N^=2, 4, 8 and 16, 
respectively. 

It can be clearly seen that a very similar result has been obtained for the case with N^=2 as 
described in our previous paper(30), that is, the main change occurs in the collective energy 
as well as the interaction energy, and the main process responsible for this change is coming 
from the dephasing mechanism. One may also learn from our previous paper(30) that the 
dissipative-diffusion mechanism plays a crucial role in reducing the oscillation amplitude of

environment. 

However, with the increasing of the number of degrees of freedom of intrinsic subsystem, 
the collective energy, after finishing the dephasing process, gradually decreases and finally 
reaches to a saturated value. This saturated asymptotic may be understood as a realization 
of the dynamics balance between an input of energy into the collective subsystem from the 
fluctuation of nonlinear coupling interaction between the two subsystems and an output of 
energy due to its dissipation into the environment. It is no doubt that there appears another 
mechanism for the N^ larger than 2.

8 and 16. Parameters are the same as Fig. 16. 

Here we also should noticed the asymptotic average energies for every degrees of freedom in 
the intrinsic subsystem and that of collective subsystem as shown in Table 1. Considering a 
boundary effect of the finite system, i.e., the two ends oscillator in /3-FPU Hamiltonian, one 
may see that the equipartition of the energy among every degree of freedom is expected in the 
final stage for the case with relatively large number of degrees of freedom, as Nj >8. 

3.2.3 Three regimes of collective dissipation dynamics 

One can understand from Figs. 16 and 17 that the energy transfer process of collective 
subsystem can be divided into three regimes: (1) Dephasing regime. In this regime, the 
fluctuation interaction reduces the coherence of collective trajectories and damps the average 
amplitude of collective motion. This regime is the main process in the case when system with 
small number of degrees of freedom (say, two). When the number of degrees of freedom 
increases, the time scale of this regime will decrease; (2) Non-equilibrium relaxation regime, 
which will also be called as thermodynamical regime in the next section. In this regime, the 
energy of collective motion irreversibly transfers to the "environment"; (3) Saturation regime. 
This is an asymptotic regime where the total system reaches to another equilibrium situation 
and the total energy is equally distributed over every degree of freedom realized in the cases 
with Nd >8 . We will mention above three regimes again in our further discussion. 
From the conventional viewpoint of transport theory, we can see that such the gradually 
decreasing behaviour of collective energy is due to an irreversible dissipative perturbation, 
which comes from the interaction with intrinsic subsystem and damps the collective motion. 
The asymptotic and saturated behaviour reveals that a fluctuation-dissipation relation may 
be expected for the cases with Nj >8. Remembering our previous simulation(30) by using 
Langevin equation for the case with N^=2, we can see, in that case, the role of fluctuation 
interaction mainly contribute to provide the diffusion effect which reduce the coherence of 
collective trajectories. The irreversible dissipative perturbation (friction force) is relatively 
small. However, an appearance of the second regime may indicate that the contribution of the 
dissipative (damping) mechanism will become large with the increasing of N&. We will show 



92 Chaotic Systems 

in the next section that it is the dissipative (damping) mechanism that makes the collective 
distribution function of the cases with N^ > 8 evolves to cover the whole energetically 
allowed region as the solution of the Langevin equation. In this sense, one may expect that 
the above mentioned numerical simulation provide us with very richer information about the 
dissipative behaviour of collective subsystem, which changes depending on the number of 
degrees of freedom in intrinsic subsystem. 

According to a general understanding, the non-equilibrium relaxation regime (or called as 
thermodynamical regime) may also be understood by the Linear Response Theory (24; 26; 27) 
provided that the number of degrees of freedom is sufficient large. However, as in the study of 
quantum dynamical system, the dephasing process only can be understood under the scheme 
with non-linear coupling interaction, specially for the small number of degrees of freedom. 
From our results, as shown in Fig. 17, it is clarified that the time scale of dephasing process 
changes to small with the increasing of the number of degrees of freedom. For the case with 
two degrees of freedom, the dephasing process lasts for a very long time and dominates the 
time evolution process of the system. When the number of degrees of freedom increases 
upto sixteen, the time scale is very small and nonequilibrium relaxation process becomes 
the main process for energy dissipation. So, in our understanding, for the case with small 
number of degrees of freedom (N^ <8) where the applicability of Linear Response Theory is 
still a question of debate(61; 77), the dephasing mechanism plays important role for realizing 
the transport behaviors. When the number of degrees of freedom becomes large (more than 
sixteen), the thermodynamical mechanism will become a dominant mechanism and there will 
be no much difference between the Nonlinear and Linear Response Theory. 

4. Entropy evolution of nonequilibrium transport process in finite system 

It is not a trivial discussion how to understand the three regimes as mentioned in above section 
in a more dynamical way. As mentioned in Sec. II, the transport, dissipative and damping 
phenomena could be expressed by the collective behavior of the ensemble of trajectories. In 
the classical theory of dynamical system, the order-to-chaos transition is usually regarded 
as the microscopic origin of an appearance of the statistical state in the finite system. Since 
one may express the heat bath by means of the infinite number of integrable systems like the 
harmonic oscillators whose frequencies have the Debye distribution, it may not be a relevant 
question whether the chaos plays a decisive role for the dissipation mechanism and for the 
microscopic generation of the statistical state in a case of the infinite system. In the finite 
system where the large number limit is not secured, the order-to-chaos transition is expected 
to play a decisive role in generating some statistical behavior. There should be the relation 
between the generating the chaotic motion of a single trajectory and the realizing a statistical 
state for a bundle of trajectories. 

4.1 Nonequilibrium relaxation process & entropy production 
4.1.1 Physical Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy 

This phenomenon is still represented in the study for clarifying the dynamical relation 
between the Kolmogorov-Sinai (KS) entropy and the physical entropy for a chaotic 
conservative dynamical system in classical sense(78), or the status of quantum-classical 
correspondence for quantum dynamical system(13). The KS entropy is a single number k, 
which is related to the average rate of exponential divergence of nearby trajectories, that 
is, the summation of all the positive Lyapunov exponents of the chaotic dynamical system 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 93 

considered. As for the physical Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) entropy S(t), the entropy of the second 
law of thermodynamics, is defined by the distribution function p(t) (68) of a bundle of 
trajectories as:

which depends not only on the particular dynamical system, but also on the choice of an 
initial probability distribution for the state of that system, which is described by a bundle of 
trajectories. Therefore the connection between KS entropy and physical (BG) entropy can be 
considered to given an equivalent relation to that between the chaoticity of a single trajectory 
and the statistical state for a bundle of trajectories. However, this relation may be not so 
simple because the KS entropy is the entropy of a single trajectory and in principle, might 
not coincide with the Gibbs entropy expressed in terms of probability density of a bundle of 
trajectories. 

It has been concluded(78) that the time evolution of S(t) goes through three time regimes: (1) 
An early regimes where the S(t) is heavily dependent on the details of the dynamical system 
and of the initial distribution. This regime sometimes is called as the decoherence regime for a 
Quantum system or dephasing regime for classical system. In this regime, there is no generic 
relation between S(t) and k; (2) An intermediate time regime of linear increase with slope k, i.e., 
| }. - 1 ~ k, which is called the Kolmogorov-Sinai regime or thermodynamical regime. In this 
regime, a transition from dynamics to thermodynamics is expected to occur; (3) A saturation 
regime which characterizes equilibrium, for which the distribution is uniform in the available 
part of phase space. In accordance with the view of Krylov(79), a coarse graining process is 
required here by the division of space. 

4.1.2 Generalized nonextensive entropy & anomalous diffusion 

It should be mentioned that the physical (BG) entropy S(t)(89) is unable to deal with a variety 
of interesting physical problems such as the thermodynamics of self gravitating systems, some 
anomal diffusion phenomena, Levy flights and distributions, among others(80-83). In order 
to deal with these difficulties, a generalized, nonextensive entropy form is introduced(84):

, N d 

I IpWdqdpJJdqidpi 



SÂ«(*) = H^ ' < 9 Â°) 

a â 1 

where a is called the entropic index, which characterizes the entropy functional S a (i). When 
a. = 1, SÂ«(f) reduces to the conventional physical (BG) entropy S(t)(89). 

How to understand the departure of a. from a = 1 has been discussed in Refs.(80; 82). From a 
macroscopic point of view, the diversion of a. from a = 1 measures how that the dynamics of 
the system do not fulfil the condition of short-range interaction and correlation that according 
to the traditional wisdom are necessary to establish thermodynamical properties(80). On the 
other hand, such diversion can be attributed to the mixing (and not only ergodicity) situation in 
phase space, that is, if the mixing is exponential (strong mixing), the Oi = 1 and physical (BG) 
entropy S(t) is the adequate hypothesis, whereas the mixing is weak and then nonextensive 
entropy form should be used(82). We will show in the following that a 7^ 1 implies the 
non-uniform distribution in the collective phase space.

It should be very interesting that our simulated energy transfer processes show also three 
regimes as mentioned in Sec. 3.2.3. Consequently, it is an interesting question whether there 
is some relation between our numerical simulation and the time evolution of S(t) or SÂ«(f). To 
understand the underlying connection between these two results, we calculated the entropy 
evolution process for our system by employing a generalized, nonextensive entropy:

Figure 18 shows the comparison between the physical (BG) entropy S(t) in Fig. 18(a) and 
nonextensive entropy S a (t) Fig. 18(b-d) for collective, intrinsic subsystems and total system 
for the case with Nj = 8. From this figure, it is understood that there is no entropy 
produced for collective subsystem before the coupling interaction is activated. However the 
entropy evaluation process for intrinsic subsystem shows very obviously three regimes both in 
physical (BG) entropy and in nonextensive entropy. This means that the intrinsic subsystem 
(/3-FPU system) can normally diffuse far from equilibrium state to equilibrium state, where 
the trajectories are uniformly distributed in the phase space. This conclusion is consistent 
with Ref. (26). After the coupling interaction is switched on, one can see much different 
situation when one use the physical (BG) entropy or nonextensive entropy in evaluating the 
entropy production. For intrinsic subsystem, because its time scale is much smaller than 
collective one, it should be always in time-independent stationary state even after switch-on 
time t sw (30). This point can be clearly seen from the present simulation in Fig. 18, where there 
is no change for S*(t) around t sw . However, the distribution of trajectories in phase space 
ought to be changed after t sw (85) which can not be observed by BG entropy. Such the change 
of the distribution of trajectories in phase space is observed by means of Sâ(f) as shown in 
Fig. 18 (c). We will mention this point furthermore in the following context. 
With regard to collective subsystem, our calculated results for S (t) and for Sâ (t) have 
been shown in Fig. 18(a) and (b) . From Fig. 18(a), one may observe that S (t) increase 
exponentially to a maximum value just after t sw . It is not trivial to answer whether or not 
this maximum value indicates the stationary state for collective degree of freedom because 
as mentioned in the last section, the energy interchange between collective and intrinsic 
subsystems is still continuous in this moment. We can understand this point if we examine 
the nonextensive entropy Sâ (() in Fig. 18(b). Fig. 18(b) shows that S^(t) exponentially 
increases to a maximal value as S (t) , but then almost linearly decrease and finally tends 
to a saturated time-independent value. The calculated results of second moment of (q ) has 
shown that such the linearly decreasing process is a superdiffusion process. Those calculated 
results tells that, for N^ = 8, the time evolution of Sâ (t) shows clearly three regimes after t sw , 
says, exponentially increasing regime, linearly decreasing regime and saturated regime. 
For understanding the N^-dependence of three regimes of transport process, furthermore, we 
show the comparison of Sâ (() for N^=2, 4, 8 and 16, respectively in Fig. 19 . One may see 
that the line for the case with N^=2 only shows the exponentially increasing behaviour. It has 
been pointed out(30) that, the dephasing mechanism is mainly contributed to the transport 
process in the case with N^ = 2. With this point of view, it is easy to understand that the 
exponentially increasing part corresponds to the dephasing regime. As our understanding, the time 
scale of dephasing regime mainly depends on the strength of coupling interaction and the 
chaoticity of intrinsic subsystem, as well as the number of degrees of freedom. In our result, 
the time scales of dephasing regime for different N^ are different with the selection interaction 
strength A and the largest Lyapunov exponents cr(N^) for intrinsic subsystem.

Fig. 19. Comparison of Sâ (Â£) for N^=2, 4, 8 and 16. Parameters are the same as Fig. 18. 

With the N^ increasing upto 8, a linearly decreasing process for Sâ(f) appears after an 
exponentially increasing stage. As we understand in last subsection, this should be 
correspondent to the nonequilibrium relaxation process in which the energy of collective 
motion irreversibly transfers to the "environment". 

It is interesting to mention that there also appears three stages in the entropy production 
for far-from-equilibrium processes, which is also characterized by using the nonextensive 
entropy (78). Here it should be noted the point that why the second regime is linearly 
decreasing, not linearly increasing as V. Latora and M. Baranger's findings(78). The systems 
considered by V. Latora and M. Baranger(78) and others (13; 80; 81) are conservative chaotic 
systems. As we know, for conservative chaotic systems, the entropy will uniquely increase 
if it is put in a state far from equilibrium state. Our calculated results is consistent with 
this phenomenon for the total system, which is a conservative system, as shown in Fig. 3 
(d), and for intrinsic subsystem, which also can be treated as a conservative system before 
t sw , as shown in Fig. 3 (c). Especially, the collective subsystem is a dissipative system after 
t sw . In the second regime of energy dissipation as described in the last section, the energy of 
collective motion irreversibly dissipate to intrinsic motion, which should cause the shrink of 
the distribution of collective trajectories in phase space. 

A necessity of using a non-extensive entropy in connecting the microscopic dynamics and the 
statistical mechanics, and in characterizing the damping phenomenon in the finite system, 
might suggest us that the damping mechanism in the finite system is an anomalous process, 
where the usual fluctuation-dissipation theorem is not applicable. 

Here it is worthwhile to clarify a relation between an anomalous diffusion and the above 
mentioned nonextensive entropy expressed by the time evolution of the subsystems with 
a. < 1, because the non-equilibrium relaxation regime is characterized not by the physical 
BG entropy but by the nonextensive entropy with a < 1. Generally, the diffusion process is 
characterized by the average square displacement or its variance as 



(T 2 (t) 



P, 



(93) 



with ji = 1 for normal diffusion. All processes with ji ^ 1 are termed anomalous diffusion, 
namely, subdiffusion for < \i < 1 and superdiffusion for 1 < \i < 2.

Fig. 16 



We calculate a time-dependent variance of collective coordinate ai 
=8 as depicted in Fig. 



= <<?' - (f)t)t for 
the case -with N^=8 as depicted in Fig. 20, which also clearly shows the three stages as 
discussed above. Here one should mentioned that cc(t) decreasing from a maximal value 
to a saturation one in the non-equilibrium relaxation regime, rather than increases from a 
minimal value to a saturation one as in the conventional approach. In the conventional 
approach, there does not appear dephasing regime. The collective distribution function p t j(t) 
spread out from a localized region (say, as ^-distribution) till saturation with an equilibrium 
Boltzmann distribution. In this case, oi{t) increases from a minimal value (say, zero) to 
a saturation one corresponding to the Boltzmann distribution. However, in present case 
for finite system, oj(t) exponentially increases from up to a maximal value in dephasing 
regime as the behavior of entropy Sâ(f) in Fig. 18(b) because in this regime, the collective 
distribution function pâ (t) quickly disperses after the coupling interaction is switched on and 
tends to cover a ring shape in the phase space. In the second regime of energy dissipation, the 
collective energy irreversibly dissipates into the intrinsic system with making the distribution 
of collective trajectories in phase space shrunk until saturation with an equilibrium Boltzmann 
distribution. It is due to the finite effect that cri(t) becomes much bigger than its saturation 

value in the dephasing regime. Therefore, in the second regime, crÂ£(t) will decreases from 

this maximal value to a saturation one with shrinking of distribution function of collective 

trajectories in phase space. 

As discussed in Sec. 3.2.3, dephasing regime is the main process for a system with small 

number of intrinsic degrees of freedom (say, two). A lasting time of this regime decreases 

with increasing of the number of intrinsic degrees of freedom. When the number of intrinsic 

degrees of freedom becomes infinite, there might be no dephasing regime. In this case, ui(t) 

will show the same behavior as in the conventional approach. 

The result of ui(t) in non-equilibrium relaxation regime can be characterized with the 

expression

4.2 Microscopic dynamics of nonequilibrium process & Boltzmann distribution 

In order to explore this understanding more deeply, a time development of the collective 
distribution function prj{t) in collective (p,q) space and probability distribution function of 
collective trajectories which is defined as

are shown in Figs. 22 and 23 at different time for N^ = 8 . In these figures, it is illustrated how 
a shape of the distribution function pâ (t) in the collective phase space disperses depending on 
time. An effect of the damping mechanism ought to be observed when a peak location of the 
distribution function changes from the outside (higher collective energy) region to the inside 
(lower collective energy) region of the phase space. On the other hand, a dissipative diffusion 
mechanism is studied by observing how strongly a distribution function initially (at t = t sw ) 
centered at one point in the collective phase space disperses depending on time. 
One may see that from 1=t sw to 110t co ;, pij(t) quickly disperses after the coupling interaction 
is switched on and tends to cover a ring shape in the phase space. When the distribution 
function tends to expand over the whole ring shape, the relevant part of each trajectory is 
not expected to have the same time dependence. Some trajectories have a chance to have 
an advanced phase, whereas other trajectories have a retarded phase in comparison with the 
averaged motion under mean-field approximation. This dephasing mechanism is considered 
to be the microscopic origin of the entropy production in the exponential regime. 
The more interesting things appear from T=110t co ; through T=140t co ;. One may see that 
the distribution function gradually expand to center region from T=110t co ;. The region 
of maximal probability distribution gradually moves to center, meanwhile the density of

with the results simulated by Langevin equation. So one can see that a transition from dynamics 
to thermodynamics occurs indeed and the collective subsystem nally reaches to equilibrium state. 
At the end of this section, one may conclude that: (i) When the physical BG entropy is 
used to evaluate the entropy production for the system considered in this work, the three 
characteristic regimes can not be detected in the collective system. When the non-extensive 
entropy is used with a. < 1.0, the three dynamical stages, i.e., the dephasing regime, 
non-equilibrium relaxation regime and equilibrium regime, appear for a relatively large 
number of intrinsic degrees of freedom as N^ > 8. The second regime may disappear for 
a small number of degrees of freedom case like Nj = 2. (ii) Since the collective system is a 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 101 

dissipative system whose distribution function varies non-uniformly in the non-equilibrium 
relaxation regime, one has to use the entropy index a different from 1 . (iii) As is shown by the 
o~}(t) and by a < 1, the non-equilibrium relaxation process of a finite system considered in this 
thesis corresponds to the anomalous diffusion process, (iv) The final regime is consistent with 
the simulation obtained by the phenomenological transport equation. Namely, the statistical 
state is actually realized dynamically in a finite system which is composed by the collective 
and intrinsic systems coupled with the nonlinear interaction. 

5. A generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation of collective motion 

5.1 Derivation of a generalized Fokker-Planck equation 

Now we are at the position to analytically understand why and how the second regime, 
i.e., thermodynamical regime, appears when the number of degrees of freedom of intrinsic 
subsystem increases from Nj = 2 to larger one, as N^ = 8. In principle, we can start from the 
coupled master equation (43), which includes the full information about the time evolution 
of the two subsystems. However, the coupled master equation (43) is still equivalent to the 
original Liouville equation (28) and is, in fact, not yet tractable specially for a system far from 
the stationary states(30). 

As was discussed in above sections, when we mainly focus our discussion on the second 
regime, the intrinsic degrees of freedom can be considered to be in fully developed chaotic 
situation. In this case, it is reasonable to assume that the effects on the collective system 
coming from the intrinsic one are mainly expressed by an averaged effect over the intrinsic 
distribution function (Assumption). Namely, the effects due to the fluctuation part H&(t) are 
assumed to be much smaller than those coming from H^ + H^(f) and are able to be treated 
as a stochastic perturbation around the path generated by the mean-field Hamiltonian H^ + 
Hâ(t) 2 . In Sec. 3.1.4, a phenomenological transport equation (82) was used in reproducing 
our simulated results phenomenologically 

M, + Â«qjM + *-,(,), ,-I+f. ,97, 

was used in reproducing our simulated results phenomenologically. Here U m f (q) denotes 
the potential part of H,j + Hn(t), 7 the friction parameter and /(f) the Gaussian white noise 
with an appropriate temperature. Since our present main concern is to make clear a relation 
between the macro-level dynamics organized by the phenomenological equation like Eq. 
(97) (or like Fokker-Planck equation (118) or the macro-level equation (123) discussed in the 
following) and the micro-level dynamics by the coupled master equation (43) one step further, 
we start with the Hamiltonian of collective degree of freedom, which organizes the collective 
distribution function pn(t), formally written as: 

Hj = H,+H,(f)+A%,(f) (98) 

where H,j and Hn(t) are defined in Eq. (64) and Eq. (33), respectively. The main differences 
between Eq. (97) and Eq. (98) arei) 7and/(t) inEq. (97) are given by hand, ii)p^(f) specifying 
the fluctuation effects H&â(t) in Eq.(98) is determined microscopically by Eq. (43). What we 
are going to discuss in the following, with the aid of Eq. (98), is to understand a change of 



2 Hereafter, 'mean-field' is used to express an average effect over the intrinsic distribution function p?(t). 



102 Chaotic Systems 

phenomenological parameters in Eqs. (97), (118) or (123) in terms of the fluctuation associated 

with the microscopic dynamics p? (t) determined by Eq. (43). 

In terms of Eqs. (85) and (86), the coupling interaction can generally expressed as 

H coupl (i 1 ,Z) = A'Â£A l (t 1 )Bl(Z). (99) 

; 

For simplicity, we hereafter discard the summation I in the coupling. The fluctuation 
Hamiltonian H A â(t) in Eq. (98) then reads 

H &iV (t) = <p'(t)A(r,) cp'(t) = B(Â£)-(B(Â£)} 3 . (100) 

With the aid of the partial Hamiltonian (98), the distribution function of collective subsystem 
pâ (t ) determined by Eq. (43) then may be explored by using the Liouville equation given by: 

= -i(Ct,+ Â£y(t) + XÂ£ Atr ,(t)) Pri (t) (101) 

where Cj, and C&â(t) are defined as in Eq. (34). 

Â£r* = i{H* t *}p B , (102a) 

Â£ Arl] (t)* = i{H Aill (t),*} PB (102b) 

Here {, }pb denotes a Poisson bracket with respect to the collective variables. 
Since, in this section, we are interested in understanding the microscopic dynamics which 
is responsible for the appearance of the second regime, we can start our discussion from 
a situation where the dephasing processes have finished, which means that the collective 
subsystem has reached the situation where the distribution function has the space-reversal 
symmetry as shown in Figs. 22 and 22 for t > 100t co ;. Considering that the time scale of 
dephasing process is much smaller than that of thermodynamical process, the correlation 
between dephasing and thermodynamical process might be omissible. In this case, the 
Liouvillian equation (101) can be considered to describe the evolution of distribution function 
Prj {t ) only caused by dissipative mechanism. 

Although H A â(t) contains the intrinsic variables, in the present formulation, the fluctuation 
H A â(t) should be considered to be a time dependent stochastic force expressed as tp'{t) in 
Eq. (100), and a stochastic average is obtained by taking the integration over the intrinsic 
variables with a weight function p^(t). Here it should be noticed that the Liouville equation 
(101) is an approximation to Eq. (43). Since our present aim is to explore how the effects 
on the collective system coming from the intrinsic fluctuation (f>'(t) change depending on the 
number of intrinsic degrees of freedom as simple as possible, we start with Eq. (101) rather 
than Eq. (43). Namely, the collective fluctuation effects originated from A(rj) â Tr^A(rj)p^ 
on the intrinsic system ought to be disregarded, because we are now studying the average 
dynamics of collective motion. 



3 Except specific definition, thereafter, the average is obtained by taking the integration over the intrinsic 
variables with a weight function p^ ( t ) at time t, say < * > = 7>j * pAt). 



Microscopic Theory of Transport Phenomenon in Hamiltonian Chaotic Systems 1 03 

It should be emphasized that we formally express the partial Hamiltonian and Liouville 
equation of collective degree of freedom as Eqs. (98) and (101). However, in order to closely 
relate our analysis carried out in this section with our numerical simulation as shown in last 
two section, the Liouville equation (101) will not be used to determine p,, (t), but be used only 
to understand what happens in the collective distribution function ptj(t), which is numerically 
obtained by integrating the canonical equations of motion (69) with the Hamiltonian in Eq. 
(25). 

Let us start our discussion just after the dephasing process has finished. Eq. (101) may now 
be a linear stochastic equation with fluctuation term Â£&â(t). When the fluctuation part is 
regarded as a perturbation, one may introduce the mean- eld propagator 

G n {t,t') = Texp I -i f[C v + Â£ v (x)]dx 1 (103) 

which describes an average time-evolution of the collective system. 

Under the help of the mean- eld propagator GÂ«(f, t ) and taking the stochastic average over 

p?(t), one may obtain the master equation for pti(t) from Eq. (101), as 

p v (t)= -i {Â£, + Â£,(*)} p,(t) 

CO 

-A 2 J dx((C A)t ,(t)G v (t,t - T)Â£ A/1/ (f - T)Â»G,,(f - T,t)p v (t) (104) 

o 

where a symbol <C â  â  â  3> denotes a cumulant defined as: 

Â«; AB^>=<AB > - < A >< B > (105) 

which relates to the average < * >t= Tr? * p^(t)- A derivation of Eq. (104) is given in 
Appendix 10. 

In getting Eq. (104) from Eq. (142), we have supposed that the collective distribution function 
Prj (t ) evolves through the mean-field Hamiltonian H,j + H^(t) from t â X to t. This is because 
the fluctuation effects are so small as to be treated as a perturbation around the path generated 
by the mean-field Hamiltonian Hq + H^(t), and are sufficient to be retained in Eq. (104) up 
to the second order in A. Under the assumption of a weak coupling interaction and of a finite 
correlation time r c 

{{cp'(t)(p'(t')))=0 for \t-t'\>T c 

an upper limit in the time integration in Eq. (104) may be extended to oo. 
Eq. (104) is valid upto the second-order cumulant expansion. Here 

<(*W(0Â» = <*W(0) - <*'(*)> W)> 

The mean- eld propagator operator G,j(t, t â x) provides the solution of unperturbed equation. 
That is, there holds a relation 

f(n,t) = G ll (t,t-r)f( !] ,t-x), (106)

Here the parameter T (or B$) represents the damping effects on collective dynamical motion

and the damping phenomenon (described by Bj, or T) implies that the energy is irreversibly 
dissipated from collective subsystem and absorbed by intrinsic one.

A real eigenvalue of the matrix in above equation indicates an instability of collective 

trajectory which is caused by the chaoticity of intrinsic trajectory through fluctuation 

Hamiltonian H^ â(48). 

Equations (118), (123) and (125) have set up an phenomenological relation among the 

micro-level properties of the intrinsic subsystem and the macro-level time evolution of 

collective subsystem through microscopic correlation functions. 

Employing the numerical simulation results for Eq. (69), we calculate the correlation function 

{{cp(t)(p(t â t))) at t = 120t co ; for the case with N^ = 2, 4 and 8 as shown in Fig. 24. Generally

speaking, the correlation function {{(p(t)cp(t â t))), as well as the parameters $\,f>i and /?3 
may have a strong time dependence, when the intrinsic system undergoes a drastic change 
like in the dephasing regime. Since, in the present context, we want to understand why 
the second regime, i.e., thermodynamical regime, appears when the number of degrees of 
freedom of intrinsic subsystem increases from N^ = 2 to larger one, as N^ = 8, it is reasonable 
for us to select a moment, just after the dephasing process has finished. From Figs. 16 ~ 23, 
it can be seen that t = 120t co ; is just corresponds to such the moment. This is the reason why 
we calculate the correlation function at t = 120t co ;. 

From Fig. 24, one can see that the correlation function for the case with Nj = 2 is very weak 
and oscillates around ((cp(t)ip(t â t)))( = 0. In this case, the main influence of the intrinsic 
subsystem on collective one acts as a source of dephasing, and has finished before t = 120t co ; 
. As Nj increases, the magnitude of the correlation function becomes large and behaves like a 
"colored noise" with finite correlation time t c : 

((4>(t)4>{t-T)))~e-% 

From this calculation, the correlation function seems to reach a 5 function which represents a 
"white noise" when N^ increases to infinite. This results verify our understanding as shown 
in Sec. 3.2 and 4: 

â¢ The dephasing regime is the main mechanism for the small number of freedom (say, two) 



â¢ Both the dynamical description and conventional transport approach can provide us with 
almost same macro- and micro-level mechanisms only for the system with very large 
number of degrees of freedom, however, for the finite system, the statistical relaxation 
is an anomalous diffusion and the fluctuation effects have nite correlation time. 

In fact, the approximation of "white noise" is never exactly realized for the realistic physical 
system, specially for the finite system. What must be done is to consider the noise and 
the physical system within which, or upon which, it is operating together. Specifically, the 
finite-time correlation of noise must be taken into account.

Table 2. Calculated values of parameter ^3 at t = 120t co ; for the case with N^=2, 4, 8 and 16, 
respectively. 

Using above results of correlation function, we calculate the parameter ^3 as shown in Table 
2. As is obviously seen, the damping effects on collective dynamical motion will increases 
when the number of degree of freedom increases. For the case with small number of degree 
of freedom, the damping effects are too small to make the second regime realized. This 
understanding is consistent with our conclusion stated in Sec. 3. 1.4-3. 1.5 and in our previous 
paper(30), where we pointed out that the dephasing mechanism is essential for the damping of 
the collective energy in the case with two degrees of freedom. However for the case with larger 
number of degree of freedom as Nj = 8 or more, the damping effects become appreciable 
and make the collective system thermodynamically relaxed to an equilibrium state. This 
result provides us with a microscopically understanding on how and why the second and 
third regimes are realized for the collective system coupled to the intrinsic system with an 
appropriately large number of degrees of freedom. 

At the end of this section, we 'want to discuss on the fluctuation-dissipation relation of 
collective motion (124). As mentioned in Sec. 3.2.2, the energy equipartition among every 
degrees of freedom can be expected in the final regime for the case with relatively larger 
number of degrees of freedom, as N^=8. This situation just corresponds to a case where 
the conventional transport equation is applied and the fluctuation-dissipation relation of the 
collective motion is expected. 
Since the collective energy is given by 

(Â£> = 2M + \ mu? ^' (126) 

which is derived from Eq. (64), one may evaluate a rate of collective energy change as 

d(E) 



dt 



4A 2 M 2 w' 2 B 3 + 2A 2 B 2 , > 4A 2 fe . .' 

m -(w>â sr^ 



(127) 



by using Eq. (125). Since the energy interchange between the two subsystems is supposed to 
have finished on the average in the third regime,, that is, from Eq. (127), the relation 



[(2M 



â¢' 2 fo + h)(qq)-2ll 3 (pp)\ =0 (128) 



should be satisfied. Figure 25 shows the results of the right-hand-side of equation (127). It is 
clearly seen that a relation (128) is actually satisfied on the third regime. 

To summarize this section, one may get the following conclusions. The damping mechanism 
caused by fluctuation interaction is the main reason of the appearance of the thermodynamical 
process. When the number of intrinsic degrees of freedom is relatively large (as JV^=8), the 
damping mechanism makes the realization of the thermodynamical process and the saturated

situation. In this case, the traditional Fokker-Planck equation is safely used in describing the 
thermodynamical process, and a Fluctuation-Dissipation relation is well realized. 
It should be pointed out that, in this section, we have used the microscopic master 
equation (104) rather than the coupled master equation (43), in order to analytically study 
the microscopic dynamics responsible for the macro-level dissipative motion as plainly as 
possible. Although the similarity between Eq. (104) and Eq. (43) is obvious, the former does 
not includes the effects coming from the response functions which are also known to play 
an important role in understanding an interrelation between the micro-level and macro-level 
dynamics. Since the effects of the response function was explored in our previous paper(21), 
and since the former is convenient to show the physical role of the correlation function clearly, 
in this section, we have started our analytical discussion from Eq. (104). Apparently, it is our 
next subject to study the role of the dynamical correlation and dynamical response functions 
more deeply and more comprehensive way. 



6. Linear and nonlinear coupling 

According to the SCC method, which has been developed to optimally divide the total space 
into the relevant and irrelevant subspaces, there should not remain any linear coupling 
interaction between two spaces. In other words, one may optimally divide the total system 
into the two decoupled subsystems by using such a dynamical condition that the linear 
coupling between them should be eliminated. Since a ratio between the time scale of the 
well developed collective motion and that of the single-particle motion is typically less than 
one order of magnitude in such a finite system as nucleus, it is a very important task to 
carefully study how the relevant degrees of freedom are distinguished from the rest degrees 
of freedom. On the basis of the SCC method, one may state that the separation of the total 
system into two subsystems coupled with a linear interaction has no physical meaning in a 
finite system, because a choice of the coordinate system , i.e., a separation between the relevant 
and irrelevant coordinates remains arbitrary when there remains a linear coupling between 
them. This statement is easily recognized when one remembers that the harmonic oscillators 
coupled with the linear interaction reduce to the uncoupled harmonic oscillators by a proper 
choice of the coordinate system. Here, we do not intend to extend the above statement for

the infinite system, because there is many order of magnitude difference between a time scale 
of the macroscopic motion and that of the microscopic one, and there are huge number of 
degrees of freedom in the infinite irrelevant system. 

In order to explore the different effects between the linear and nonlinear coupling interactions 
on the dissipative process, we have made a numerical simulation for the /3 Fermi-Pasta-Ulam 
(/3-FPU) model described in Sec. 3.2.1. The collective Hâ, intrinsic H^ are the same as in Sec. 
3.2.1, but a coupling H cou âi Hamiltonians is given as 



H, 



coupi = A<? â  q\. 



(129) 



The numerical results are illustrated in Fig. 26. In Fig. 26(a), the coupling is switch on from 
the beginning, whereas in Fig. 26(b) it is switch on at t sw = 500t,â when a chaotic situation 
has been well realized in the intrinsic system. In Fig. 26(a), one may observe small energy 
transfer from the collective to the intrinsic system when the system reach its stationary state 
at t ~ 400t,â. Namely < Hg > becomes a little bit greater than 80 and < Hâ > less than 
10. Before reaching their stationary states, especially at the early stage at t < 100t,â, there are 
violent energy exchange between the collective and intrinsic systems. Since it is not allowed to 
apply some statistical treatment for the intrinsic system in this early stage when no stationary 
state is realized for it, there might be no reason to apply the Langevin type equation for a case 
in Fig. 26(a). In other words, the above energy transfer may not be understood in terms of 
the macroscopic terms. When one switches on the coupling after the chaotic state has been 
realized in the intrinsic system, there is almost no energy dissipation in the collective motion 
as is seen from Fig. 26(b). 

An essential difference between the linear and nonlinear coupling cases may be understood as 
follows: As is seen from Eq. (77), the coupling H cou âi produces the mean field potential H,,(t) 

in the case of the nonlinear coupling, because the second moment < 2?=i{'?i + Pi } > nas 
some value when the intrinsic system reaches some stationary state. It is recognized from 
Eq. (81) that this average effect plays a decisive role to define an amount of transferred 
energy from the collective system to the environment, like the friction force. On the other 
hand, H cou âi does not produce any averaged effects on the collective motion in the case with 
the linear coupling, because there holds a relation < q, > = when the statistical state is 
realized in the intrinsic system. With regards to the /3-FPU model, one may conclude that the

energy dissipation phenomena may not be expected for a finite system, although the other 
main numerical results described in Ref. (26) have been reproduced. 

However, as mentioned in Sec. 3.2.3, the nonequilibrium relaxation regimen (or called as 
thermodynamical regimen) may also be understood by the Linear Response Theory (24; 26; 
27) provided that the number of degrees of freedom is sufficient large. Our numerical results, 
as shown in Fig. 27, confirm this conclusion. The number of degrees of freedom Nj is chosen 
as 64, which almost can be considered as infinite. There still remain some unsolved questions 
for the case with a linear coupling interaction, such as: what is the microscopic reason for 
energy dissipation in the case with very large number of degrees of freedom (as N^ > 64); 
what is the difference in microscopic dynamics between the cases with very large and small 
number of degrees of freedom, and furthermore, why a linear coupling interaction can remain 
between relevant and irrelevant degrees of freedom for producing the Ohmic dissipation for 
relevant motion, why the linear response theory can be applied for the micro-variables which 
have a very short time scale in comparison with that for the macro-variables. Such the problem 
will be investigated in our further works. 

7. Summary 

We have systematically discussed the characteristic features of non-equilibrium processes 
for a microscopic Hamilton system with finite degrees of freedom without introducing any 
statistical ansatz. 

The total system is self-consistently and optimally divided into the relevant and irrelevant 
degrees of freedom in a way consistent with the underlying microscopic dynamics for aiming 
to properly characterize the collective motion, where the linear coupling between the relevant 
and irrelevant degrees of freedom is eliminated by the maximally-decoupled coordinate 
system. This division in the degrees of freedom turns out to be very important for exploring 
the energy dissipation process and nonlinear dynamics between the collective and intrinsic 
modes of motion. 

A macroscopic transport equation has been derived from the fully microscopic master 
equation for a microscopic system composed of the one collective degree of freedom system 
coupled to an intrinsic system with finite degrees of freedom through a weak interaction, by 
clarifying necessary underlying conditions. 



1 1 2 Chaotic Systems 

It has been found that the macro-level statistical aspects are strongly related to an appearance 
of micro-level chaotic motion, and the dissipation of collective motion is realized through 
dephasing, statistical relaxation and equilibrium regimes. Dominant stage changes depending 
on the number of intrinsic degrees of freedom. It has been clearly clarified that both the 
dynamical description and conventional transport approach can provide us with almost same 
macro- and micro-level mechanisms only for the system with very large number of degrees of 
freedom, however for the finite system, the statistical relaxation is anomalous diffusion and 
the fluctuation effects have finite correlation time. 

It is interesting to notice that the nonequilibrium relaxation regime is characterized not by the 
usual BG entropy, but by the nonextensive entropy with oc < 1, which has been used to extend 
the thermodynamics to a system with a fractal structure. 

Under the help of analytical analysis, we have shown that the energy transport process can 
be safely described by a Fokker-Planck- and Langevin-type equation, when the number of 
intrinsic degrees of freedom is relatively large. In this case, the intrinsic subsystem exhibits 
a very interesting role as a finite heat bath and the fluctuation has the finite correlation time 
(as colored noise). Only when the number of degrees of freedom for the intrinsic system is 
infinite, the intrinsic subsystem can be treated as a statistical heat bath with white noise. 
This study provides a general framework for studying the dissipative collective motion of 
such the systems as atomic, nuclei and biomolecule whose environment is not infinite.

10. Appendix 

Derivation of Eq. (104) 

In this appendix, a derivation of the master equation (104) is discussed. From the definition 
in Eq. (103), one can get that the mean-field propagator Gâ(t, t') satisfies the relation 

dT = -M-OCj +Â£?(*)) Gfl(U') (130) 

and has the properties 

G, 7 (Ui)G, ? (ti,f') = G, ? (f,f') (131a) 

G- 1 (t,t') = G l ,(t',t) (131b) 

where G^ 1 (t, t') is the inverse propagator of Gâ (t,t') 

With the aid of the mean-field propagator, the solution of Eq. (101) can be formally expressed 

as: 

p,(t) = Gq(t,0)p' v (t) (132) 

which satisfies the equation 

p v (t) = G n (t, Q)p', l (t) + G n (t, 0)p' v (t) (133) 

With Eq. (130), one gets 

p v (t) = -;A(Â£,+Â£, / (t))G,(t,0)p; / (t) + G, / (t,0)p;(t) (134) 

Inserting Eq. (132) into the r.h.s. of Eq. (101) and comparing with Eq. (134), one can easily get 

p'^t) = -i\Â£> Ait] (t)p' v (t), (135) 

where 

Â£' A/t] (t) = G- 1 (f,0)Â£ A ,, / (f)G,(f,0) (136) 

Eq. (135) is a linear stochastic differential equation. Applying cumulant expansion 
method(77), one has 

p' v {t) = -a((c' A/V (t))) P ' v (t) 

t 

-A 2 |dT((^, / (f)^(T))) P ; / (f) (137) 


where a symbol <C â  â  â  3> denotes a cumulant defined as:

which is related to the average over the intrinsic degrees of freedom 

<...>= 7>{-..} 



1 1 6 Chaotic Systems 

Eq. (137) is valid upto the second order in A. According to a definition of the fluctuation 
Hamiltonian H& â(t) in (100), the first-order term in (137) is zero since there holds a relation 

<(Â£^Â«>> -<(<*>'Â«>> = (<?'(')> =0 (139) 

one thus obtains 

t 

P',(t) = -A 2 |dT((Â£^ / (f)Â£^(T))) P ;(t) (140)

Inserting (140) into (134), one has 

p' v (t) = -i\{C v + C v (t))G v (t,0)p^(t) 

t 

-A 2 J dTG v (t,0)((C' A ^t)C' A ^r)}}p^t) (141) 

o 

With the relation (131), (132) and (136), Eq. (141) can be read as 

p' v (t) = -iA(C v + C v (t)) Pv (t) 

t 

-A 2 |dT((Â£ M (f)G, / (t,T)Â£ M (T)))G, / (T,f) ( o l/ (f) (142)

Making the variable transformation t â > t â X, one can have

1. Introduction 

For years, chaotic phenomena have been mainly studied from a theoretical point of view. In 
the last two decades, considerable developments have occurred in the control, prediction 
and observation of chaotic behaviour in a wide variety of dynamical systems, and a large 
number of applications have been discovered and reported (Moon & Holmes, 1999; Endo & 
Chua, 1991; Kennedy, 1993). Chaotic behaviour can only be observed in particular nonlinear 
dynamical systems. In recent years, nonlinearity is known as a key characteristic of micro 
resonant systems. Such devices are used widely in variety of applications, including sensing, 
signal processing, filtering and timing. In many of these applications some purely electrical 
components can be replaced by micro mechanical resonators. The benefits of using micro 
mechanical resonators include smaller size, lower damping, and improved the performance. 
Two examples of micro mechanical resonators that their complex behaviour is described 
briefly in this chapter are atomic force microscopy (AFM) and micro electromechanical 
resonators. AFM has been widely used for surface inspection with nanometer resolution in 
engineering applications and fundamental research since the time of its invention in 1986 
(Hansma et al., 1988). The mechanism of AFM basically depends on the interaction of a 
micro cantilever with surface forces. The tip of the micro cantilever interacts with the surface 
through a surface-tip interaction potential. One of the performance modes of an AFM is the 
so called "tapping mode". In this mode, the micro-cantilever is driven to oscillate near its 
resonance frequency, by a small piezoelectric element mounted in the cantilever. In this 
chapter it will be shown that micro-cantilever in tapping mode may exhibit chaotic 
behaviour under certain conditions. Such a chaotic behaviour has been studied by many 
researchers (Burnham et al. 1995; Basso et al., 1998; Ashhab et al., 1999; Jamitzky et al., 2006; 
Yagasaki, 2007). 

In section 3, the chaotic behaviour of micro electromechanical resonators is studied. Micro 
electromechanical resonant systems have been rapidly growing over recent years because of 
their high accuracy, sensibility and resolution (Bao, 1996). The resonators sensing 
application concentrate on detecting a resonance frequency shift due to an external 
perturbation such as accreted mass (Cimall et al., 2007). The other important technological 
applications of mechanical resonators include radiofrequency filter design (Lin et al., 2002) 
and scanned probe microscopy (Garcia et al., 1999). Many researchers have tried to analyze 
nonlinear behaviour in micro electeromechanical systems (MEMS) (Mestrom et al., 2007; 



120 



Chaotic Systems 



Younis & Nayfeh, 2003; Braghin et al., 2007). We will examine the mathematical model of a 
micro beam resonator, excited between two parallel electrodes. Chaotic behaviour of this 
model is studied. A robust adaptive fuzzy method is introduced and used to control the 
chaotic motion of micro electromechanical resonators. 

2. Atomic force microscopy 

The mechanism of an AFM basically depends on the interaction of a micro cantilever with 
surface forces. The tip of the micro cantilever interacts with the surface through a surface- 
tip interaction potential. One of the performance modes of an AFM is the so called "tapping 
mode". In this mode, the micro-cantilever is driven to oscillate near its resonance frequency, 
by a small piezoelectric element mounted in the cantilever. When the tip comes close to an 
under scan surface, particular interaction forces, such as Van der Waals, dipole-dipole and 
electrostatic forces, will act on the cantilever tip. Such interactions will cause a decrease in 
the amplitude of the tip oscillation. A piezoelectric servo mechanism, acting on the base 
structure of the cantilever, controls the height of the cantilever above the sample so that the 
amplitude of oscillation will remain close to a prescribed value. A tapping AFM image is 
therefore produced by recording the control effort applied by the base piezoelectric servo as 
the surface is scanned by the tip. 

From theoretical investigations it is known that the nonlinear interaction with the sample 
can lead to chaotic dynamics although the system behaves regularly for a large set of 
parameters. In this section, the model of micro cantilever sample interaction is described 
and dynamical behaviour of forced system is investigated. The cantilever tip sample 
interaction is modelled by a sphere of radius R and equivalent mass m which is connected 
to a spring of stiffness k . A schematic of the model is shown in Fig.l. The interaction of an 
intermolecular pair is given by the Lennard Jones potential which can be modelled as

For numerical simulation, we consider (3), where the parameters have been set as 
follows: Â£ = 0.3, a =1.25, S - 0.05, fl = l .For these values, the bifurcation diagram of AFM 
model is shown in Fig. 3, where the parameter T is plotted versus the cantilever tip 
positions in the corresponding Poincare map. The obtained diagram reveals that, starting at 
r = 1.2, the period orbit undergoes a sequence of period doubling bifurcation. For the 
ranger e (1.7, 2.5), the system shows complex behaviours. Fig. 4 shows various types of 
system responses for T = 1 , r = 1.5 and T = 2 .

3. Micro electromechanical resonators 

In many cases it is highly desirable to reduce the size of MEMS mechanical elements 
(Roukes, 2001). This allows increasing the frequencies of mechanical resonances and 
improving their sensitivity as sensors. Although miniaturized MEMS resonant systems have 
many attractions, they also provide several important challenges. A main practical issue is 
to achieve higher output energy, in particular, in devices such as resonators and micro- 
sensors. A common solution to the problem is the well-known electrostatic comb-drive (Xie 
& Fedder, 2002). However, this solution adds new constraints to the design of the 
mechanical structure due to the many complex and undesirable dynamical behaviours 
associated with it. Another way to face this challenge is to use a strong exciting force 
(Logeeswaran et al., 2002; Harley, 1998). The major drawback of this approach is the 
nonlinear effect of the electrostatic force. When a beam is oscillating between parallel 
electrodes, the change in the capacitance is not a perfectly linear function. The forces 



Chaos Analysis and Control in AFM and MEMS Resonators 123 

attempting to restore the beam to its neutral position vary as the beam bends; the more the 
beam is deflected, the more nonlinearity can be observed. In fact nonlinearities in MEMS 
resonators generally arise from two distinct sources: relatively large structural deformations 
and displacement-dependent excitations. Further increasing in the magnitude of the 
excitation force will result in nonlinear vibrations, which will affect the dynamic behavior of 
the resonator, and may lead to chaotic behaviors (Wang et al., 1998). The chaotic motion of 
MEMS resonant systems in the vicinity of specific resonant separatrix is investigated based 
on the corresponding resonant condition (Luo & Wang., 2002). The chaotic behavior of a 
micro-electromechanical oscillator was modelled by a version of the Mathieu equation and 
investigated both numerically and experimentally in (Barry et al., 2007). Chaotic motion was 
also reported for a micro electro mechanical cantilever beam under both open and close loop 
control (Liu et al., 2004). 

In this section, the chaotic dynamics of a micro mechanical resonator with electrostatic 
forces on both upper and lower sides of the cantilever is investigated. Numerical studies 
including phase portrait, Poincare map and bifurcation diagrams reveal the effects of the 
excitation amplitude, bias voltage and excitation frequency on the system transition to 
chaos. Moreover a robust adaptive fuzzy control algorithm is introduced and applied for 
controlling the chaotic motion. Additional numerical simulations show the effectiveness of 
the proposed control approach. 

3.1 Mathematical model 

An electrostatically actuated microbeam is shown in Fig.5. The external driving force on the 
resonator is applied via an electrical driving voltage that causes electrostatic excitation with 
a dc-bias voltage between electrodes and the resonator: V, = V b + V AC SinQ. t , where, V b is the 
bias voltage, and V AC and Q. are the AC amplitude and frequency, respectively. The net 
actuation force, F act r can then be expressed as (Mestrom et al., 2007) 

where C is the capacitance of the parallel-plate actuator at rest, d is the initial gap width 
and z is the vertical displacement of the beam. The governing equation of motion for the 
dynamics of the MEMS resonator can be expressed as

where, z' and z" represent the first and second time derivative of z , and m eff , b , k 1 and 
k 3 are effective lumped mass, damping coefficient, linear mechanical stiffness and cubic 
mechanical stiffness of the system respectively. 
It is convenient to introduce the following dimensionless variables:

Assuming the amplitude of the AC driving voltage to be much smaller than the bias voltage, 
with the dimensionless quantities defined in (6) the nondimensional equation of motion is 
obtained:

and the equilibrium point is a stable center point at x=0. When the bias voltage is not zero, 
however, at a critical position, the resonator becomes unstable and is deflected against one 
of the stationary transducer electrodes (pull-in phenomena). If the bias is small, the structure 
stays in the deflected position, smaller than the critical one. For this case, three associated 
equilibrium points are one stable center point and two unstable saddle points. As the bias 
voltage increases, the equilibrium point at x=0 becomes unstable and the potential function 
V(x) will have a local peak at this point. The original equilibrium point at the center position 
becomes a saddle point and two new center points emerge at either side of the origin. For a 
large enough bias voltage, there is only one unstable equilibrium point at x=0 and the 
resonator becomes completely unstable. 

3.2 Transition to chaos 

To verify the analytical findings, a series of numerical simulations of the exact nonlinear 
differential equation (5) is performed with the following dimensionless parameters: 
m = 5xl0- n kg, b = 5x10-" kg/s, k t =5ttN/ttm, k 3 =15//N///m 3 , d = 2^m, C = 1.5xl(r 14 F, 
Vâ =30V,Â« = 0.5. 

The unforced system has a saddle point at x = as can be seen from Fig. 7. Existence of this 
point makes homoclinic bifurcations to take place possible. This means that the system has 
the necessary condition for chaotic behaviour. 

The phase portrait and time histories are plotted for different values of the AC voltage. To 
study the effect of the AC voltage on the beam dynamics, the bias voltage is kept fix and the 
AC voltage is varied. Starting from the vicinity of the critical amplitude for V AC = 0.06V , the 
system response contains transient chaos and periodic motion around one of the center 
points (Fig. 8a). Fig. 8b reveals that following the transient chaos, the beam oscillates in the 
vicinity of the other center point for V AC = 0.17V . The more increase in the AC voltage 
causes a longer transient chaotic motion. The chaotic transient oscillation is large in 
amplitude and jumping between potential wells. After a while in such a regime of motion, a 
steady state regular vibration with much smaller amplitude, and located in a single potential 
well, is observed. As can be seen from Fig. 8c, after the transient chaotic response, a periodic 
motion may be observed, evolving out of the homoclinic orbit and, with much larger

to chaotic steady state. Fig.9 shows the phase trajectory and the Poincare map of the chaotic 
motion, with V AC = 1.8 V . The system behavior is different from that of the Duffing attractor 
because of the electrostatic terms in the MEMS equations. Because of the two unstable points 
near the fixed electrodes, there is an upper limit for the applied AC voltage.

Any more increase in the AC voltage, leads to a dynamic pull-in phenomena, which could to

3.3 Bifurcation diagrams 

Fig.ll shows the bifurcation diagram. In this case, the qualitative behavior of the system is 
shown against a varying AC voltage from to 2.8. In the bifurcation diagram, the final 
system states of the previously iterated value of the AC voltage is chosen as the initial 
condition for the next system iteration with the new value of the AC voltage. Chaotic 
behavior of system starts when V AC = 1.4V and continues until V AC = 2.8V . For AC voltages 
larger than 2.8V, the dynamic pull-in may occur, where, the electric force increases and 
becomes much higher than the spring restoring force and the resonator sticks to one of the 
stationary electrodes (Nayfeh &Younis, 2007). The initial conditions are assumed as 
(x ln ,v ilt ) = (0,0) for all simulation studies.

The characteristic dynamical behaviors are investigated by varying the bias voltage. Fig. 12 
shows the bifurcation diagram of the micro beam displacement via the applied bias voltage. 
The figure indicates that, with an increase in the applied bias voltage, a period-doubling 
bifurcation occurs, i.e., a period-1 motion becomes a period-2 motion. If the applied bias

region becomes wider as the applied bias voltage is increased.

It can be seen from Fig. 13, that the system responses contain periodic and chaotic motions. 
When V b = 20 V , the vibration amplitude of the cantilever is small, the period-1 motion with 
only one isolated point in Poincare map and one circle in phase portrait can be observed. 
With an increase in the amplitude of the applied bias voltage, the motion becomes

responses of the electrostatically actuated system over a range of frequencies. Various 
chaotic behavior is observed for a> = 0.2 and m = 0.27 . It can be seen that, for co = 0.35 , the

3.4 Control of chaotic motion in MEMS resonator 

Various fuzzy control methods for control of chaotic systems are proposed in the literature 
e.g., (Calvo, 1998; Poursamad & Markazi, 2009-a; Haghighi & Markazi, 2010). In this section, 
a robust adaptive fuzzy control algorithm is used to stabilize a MEMS beam in a high- 
amplitude oscillation state. A key issue that arises in chaos control, particularly in MEMS 
resonators, is that the system parameters are not known precisely, and are perturbed during 
operation (Wang et al., 1998). Unlike most conventional control systems whose equilibriums 
are assumed known and fixed regardless of values of the system parameters, the 
equilibriums of chaotic systems are a function of their system constant parameters. This 
suggests that, when the system parameters are not precisely known, and hence, the 
equilibriums are then unknown, the conventional control methodologies may not be applied 
directly. In addition, the presence of external disturbance and measurement noise, may 
adversely affect the system performance. Therefore, development of alternative control 
strategies for efficient control and robust tracking of chaotic systems, under the presence of 
uncertainties is highly desirable. 

The controller proposed in this section comprises a fuzzy system and a robust controller. 
The fuzzy system, whose parameters are adaptively tuned, is designed based on the sliding- 
mode control (SMC) strategy to mimic the ideal controller, i.e., when the model of the plant 
is exactly known. The robust controller is then designed to compensate for deviations of the 
fuzzy controller, compared to the ideal one. The uncertainty bound needed in the robust 
controller is also adaptively tuned online to avoid using unnecessary high switching gain, 
due to the, most often, conservative bounds. A comprehensive presentation of the proposed 
control method and proof of the asymptotic stability can be found in (Poursamad & 
Markazi, 2009-a ; Poursamad & Markazi, 2009-b). 
In order to write (5) in a more convenient form, it is rewritten as 

x=f(x,x,t) + u, (10) 

where u is the appended control input and/ is a smooth function obtained from (5). Now 
let define a sliding surface, S(t) , using s(x,x) =0 with s(x,x) = x + Xx , where x = x^ - x is the 
tracking error, x is the time derivative of x , x d is the desired trajectory and X is a to be 
selected strictly positive constant. Now, an ideal (central) control signal is obtained as 



and the control law is defined as 



â  -f+x d + Xx (11) 



u = u + u rb , (12) 



where, the robust control signal, u ri , is designed to overcome the deviations from the 
sliding surface, by employing a switching strategy: 



Chaos Analysis and Control in AFM and MEMS Resonators 



131 



= <5sgn(s) 



(13) 



Here, 8 is the bound of uncertainties. It is noted that, in the design of a conventional SMC, 
the uncertainty bound 8 , must be known or estimated at the outset of the control design, a 
matter which is not easily achievable in practice. Such uncertainties may include unknown 
plant dynamics, parameter variations, and external load disturbances. In particular, the 
dynamics of micro/nano electromechanical systems are not known exactly, so the ideal 
controller proposed in (11) may not actually work in practice. As an alternative, the ideal 
controller can be approximated by a fuzzy inference system 



-B T W(s) + y/ 



(14) 



Here, B is the estimated value for the optimal weighting vector, and PV = \w 1 â â â  W n ] is a 

vector with components w r (s) = fi r //^ u r and, where, fi r is the firing strength of the r 
rule of the fuzzy algorithm. The bias term iff represents unmodeled dynamics and external 
disturbances and is assumed to be bounded as \y/\ < \\i . The weighting vector can be updated 

by the adaptation rule B = a a s(f)W, and the bound of uncertainties is estimated by the 
adaptation rule \j/ = a 2 |s(f)| , where a x and a 2 are strictly positive constants, adaptation rates.

sliding surface is defined as s = x + X . The parameters of these membership functions are 
chosen such that the parameter s remains close to zero. The initial weighting vector is 
arbitrarily selected as B = [l l] , the initial value of the uncertainty bound is chosen 
as if/ = 0.01 and the learning rates are set to a x = 1 and a 2 = 2 x 10 . The controller is 
activated at r = 200 , for which the resulting output is depicted in Fig. 17, showing the 
effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.

4. Conclusions 

This chapter deals with the chaotic motion of micromechanical resonators. The source of 
nonlinearities in AFM is the Lennard Jones force while nonlinearities in MEMS resonator 
system include mechanical nonlinearity due to large deformation and nonlinear electrostatic 
forces. It is shown that each of these systems has one unstable fix point that connects the 
corresponding homoclinic trajectory to itself. Certain set of parameters may cause 
homoclinic bifurcation in these systems. Such a bifurcation corresponds to double periodic 
behavior of the system. It is seen that increase in the amplitude of driving force could lead to 
a chaotic motion. Finally, an adaptive fuzzy-sliding mode strategy was proposed for control 
of the chaotic motion. It was shown through simulations study that such a control strategy 
could successfully eliminate the chaotic motion and force the system response towards a 
stable orbit.

1. Introduction 

Last years, researchers paid a major attention to the controlling chaos schemes that use 
information obtained from the experimental time series of system's accessible variables. 
When the trajectory is in a neighbourhood of desired UPO, the Ott-Grebogi-Yorke (OGY) 
controlling chaos scheme can be applied (Ott et al., 1990). Exploiting the linearity of return 
map near corresponding unstable fixed point, it stabilizes UPOs with one unstable direction 
by directing the trajectory to the orbit stable manifold. The technique requires performing 
several calculations to generate a control signal. This approach may fail (i) if the dynamics is 
so fast that the controller cannot follow it, and (ii) if the dynamics is highly unstable, i.e. the 
trajectory diverges from a target so far that small perturbations cannot be effective. For highly 
dissipative systems that are well characterized by a one-dimensional return map, occasional 
proportional feedback (Hunt, 1991; Peng et al., 1991) and occasional feedback (Myneni et al., 
1999) techniques was developed. The occasional proportional feedback utilizes an amplitude 
of parametric perturbation that is proportional to the deviation of system's current state from 
its desired state (Hunt, 1991; Peng et al., 1991). Similar technique but with application to a 
system accessible variable instead of a parameter is called proportional perturbation feedback 
(Garfinkel et al., 1992). Alternatively, occasional feedback utilizes a control pulse duration that 
is equal to the transit time of trajectory through a specified window placed on either side of 
saddle fixed point (Myneni et al., 1999). Owing to simplicity, these methods do not require 
any processor and can be implemented at high speeds. 

For highly unstable orbits, quasicontinuous extensions of original OGY technique can be 
applied when more than one control points per period are taken (Htibinger et al., 1994; Reyl 
et al., 1993). Another option is to use a continuous-time control (Gauthier et al., 1994; Just et 
al., 1999b; Pyragas, 1992; 1995; Socolar et al., 1994). However, obtaining complete information 
about desired trajectory can be difficult (or even impossible, say, at high frequencies or spatial 
complexity). Therefore, the continuous-time delayed feedback using information only about 
a period of desired UPO became most popular. Here, the control signal is proportional to the 
difference between a system current state and its state at some earlier time, the delay being 
set to a period of desired UPO (Gauthier et al., 1994; Pyragas, 1992). This approach is found 
effective to control low-period UPOs at high frequencies (Gauthier et al., 1994), but it may 
fail for high-period UPOs or for highly unstable orbits (Just et al., 1999b). An extension of 
method that incorporates information from many previous states of the system is suitable for 
controlling UPOs in fast dynamical systems, with large value of Lyapunov exponents, and of 



136 Chaotic Systems 

high periods (Socolar et al., 1994). The attractiveness of delayed feedback scheme consists in 
the self-organizing ability of a system to autosynchronize its own behaviour. However, unlike 
the OGY-based schemes where the trajectory is targeted to a predefined UPO, the delayed 
feedback control does not discriminate between different periodic orbits of the same period, 
and does not necessarily lead to the stabilization of orbits embedded in a chaotic attractor 
(Hikihara et al., 1997; Simmendinger et al., 1998). The success of this control is significantly 
restricted by a control loop latency (Just et al., 1999a). 

In the nonfeedback, or open-loop, schemes, the control signal does not depend on a system 
state. One of approaches is a nonlinear entrainment method (Hiibler & Ltischer, 1989; Jackson 
& Hiibler, 1990). It requires knowledge of the system equations to construct control forces 
that can have large amplitude and complicated shape. The basins of entrainment, in turn, can 
have very complicated structure. Typically, this method can require as many control forces, as 
there are dimensions of the system. 

In contrast, there are many examples of converting chaos to a periodic motion by exposing a 
system to only one, weak periodic force or weak parameter modulation (Alexeev & Loskutov, 
1987; Braiman & Goldhirsch, 1991; Cao, 2005; Chacon, 1996; Chacon & Diaz Bejarano, 1993; 
Chizhevsky & Corbalan, 1996; Chizhevsky et al., 1997; Dangoisse et al., 1997; Fronzoni et al., 
1991; Kivshar et al., 1994; Lima & Pettini, 1990; Liu & Leite, 1994; Meucci et al., 1994; Qu et al., 
1995; Ramesh & Narayanan, 1999; Rodelsperger et al., 1995; Tereshko & Shchekinova, 1998). 
Typically, this approach utilizes only a period and an amplitude of perturbation (Alexeev & 
Loskutov, 1987; Braiman & Goldhirsch, 1991; Kivshar et al, 1994; Lima & Pettini, 1990; Liu & 
Leite, 1994; Ramesh & Narayanan, 1999). If the amplitude is kept small enough, one can expect 
a controlled periodic orbit or an equilibrium to trace closely the corresponding unperturbed 
one (provided that no crises are induced). The periodic perturbation methods can be easily 
realized in practice. However, the independence of the perturbation from a system state leads 
to some limitations of above approach: the control by periodic perturbations relying only on 
their period and amplitude is not, in general, a goal-oriented technique (Shinbrot et al., 1993). 
On the other hand, the importance of a phase (Cao, 2005; Chacon, 1996; Chizhevsky & 
Corbalan, 1996; Chizhevsky et al., 1997; Dangoisse et al., 1997; Fronzoni et al., 1991; Meucci 
et al., 1994; Qu et al., 1995; Tereshko & Shchekinova, 1998) and even a shape (Azevedo 
& Rezende, 1991; Chacon, 1996; Chacon & Diaz Bejarano, 1993; Rodelsperger et al., 1995) 
of perturbation became evident. The utilization of extra parameters allows tuning the 
perturbation to a desired target shape more selectively. The above findings were generalized 
in a concept of geometrical resonance that reveals the underlying mechanism of nonfeedback 
resonant control for a general class of chaotic oscillators (Chacon, 1996). The phase of 
perturbation is crucial for the success of nonfeedback resonant control. First of all, it 
determines the direction and, hence, the targets where a trajectory is driven to. Secondly, 
keeping the perturbation precisely in phase with the controlled signal ensures smallest control 
amplitudes, whereas dephasing can destroy the control. By changing only the perturbation 
phase, one can switch the trajectory from one controlled state to another (Tereshko & 
Shchekinova, 1998). 

In real-life systems, the existing uncontrolled drifts can spoil resonant conditions. Small 
deviation of the perturbation frequency from the resonance is equivalent to slowly varying 
modulation of the phase. This results in a temporal evolution consisting of regular alternations 
between a stabilized orbit and the chaotic behaviours (Chizhevsky & Corbalan, 1996; Meucci 
et al., 1994; Qu et al., 1995). The real-life nonfeedback control may, thus, demand an occasional 



Control and Identification of Chaotic Systems by Altering the Oscillation Energy 1 37 

adjustment of the perturbation frequency. To overcome the above problem, a feedback control 
where the perturbation depends on the controlled signal can be used. 

Have analyzed the existing approaches, we developed a following control method. To any 
type of system behaviour, we put in correspondence a value of averaged oscillation energy 
that is an averaged (over the time) compound of the system kinetic and potential energy. 
The objective is to alter this energy so as to correspond to a desired behaviour. This is a 
general approach that does not depend on particular oscillator equations. Simple feedback 
depending solely on an output signal is utilized for this purpose. We start with identifying 
the type of control perturbations appropriate for the above control. One simply increases the 
feedback strength, and, thus, depending on the perturbation phase, increases or decreases 
the oscillation energy. The above strategy does not require any computation of the control 
signal and, hence, is applicable for control as well as identification of unknown systems. The 
above approach was applied to control isolated oscillators, as well as coupled ones (Tereshko, 
2009; Tereshko et al., 2004a;b). Here, we summarize the obtained results and present our new 
findings in controlling spatially-extended systems. 

2. General approach 

Let us consider controlling a general type nonlinear oscillator 

x + X (x,x)+ax)=F(t)+g(x,x) (1) 

where x( x > x )> f(- T ) an d g( x > x ) are dissipative or energy-generating component, restoring 
force, and control force, respectively. These functions are nonlinear in general case. Also, 
X(x,x) and g(x) are assumed not to contain an additive function of x. F(t) is an external 
time-dependent driving force. 

At F(t) = and g(x,x) = 0, Eq. (1) possesses the equilibriums defined by equation 
Â£(x) = 0. In oscillators with nonlinear damping (say, van der Pol and Reyleigh oscillators), an 
equilibrium becomes unstable at some parameter values, and stable self-sustained oscillations 
are excited. In other types of oscillators, say Duffing oscillator, a limit cycle arises under the 
action of periodic driving force. We assume that at some driving amplitudes, a limit cycle 
becomes saddle, and new attractor, say period-2 cycle, arises. In many well-known examples, 
this scenario leads, through the sequence of bifurcations, to the birth of chaotic attractor. 
One can define an energy of oscillations as the sum of "potential" and "kinetic" energy: 

E(t) = jz(x)dx+ 1 -x 2 . (2) 

An averaged (over period T) energy yields 

(Â£) = i/ o T (/^(x)dx+i.t 2 )df. (3) 

For periodic dynamics T is an oscillation period, whereas for chaotic one T â > oo. Each 
attractor of an oscillator is assigned to a value of averaged energy (3). If an oscillation 
amplitude is sufficiently small, the limit cycle oscillations can be approximated as x ~ p sin tot, 
which gives (E) = \p 2 - 

Typically, transitions to a chaotic attractor correspond to the increase of energy (3). Let us 
clarify this statement on the example of a period-doubling process. Suppose that changing 
some of the system parameters results in an oscillation period doubling and, eventually, in a 



138 Chaotic Systems 

chaos. Starting at period-1 cycle, its amplitude grows with increasing the above parameter, 
and, hence, energy (3) does. Every period-doubling bifurcation contributes subharmonic (as 
well as its odd harmonic) to the fundamental frequency, which again increases energy (3). 
Thus, the higher the orbit period is, the higher the averaged energy corresponding to this orbit. 
A stationary point, around which a limit cycle develops, can be viewed as a zero-amplitude 
cycle possessing, thus, zero energy. 

A following control strategy can be proposed. Starting at a lower energy attractor, one 
stabilizes higher energy repellors by sequential increasing the averaged oscillation energy. 
On the contrary, decreasing this energy leads to the stabilization of lower energy repellors. 
A change of energy (2) yields 

Â£(t) = Â£(*)* + xx = (-x(x,x) + F(t)+g(x,x))x. (4) 

The last term of (4) represents an energy change caused solely by the control. We require that 

g(x,x)x>0(<0) (5) 

for V(x, x). A minimal feedback satisfying (5) is achieved at g = g(x). Indeed, simple linear 
(relative to the velocity) control g(x) ~ x as well as nonlinear controls of higher power, say 
g(x) ~ i 3 suffice. In general 

g(x) = kh(x) (6) 

where h(x) is assumed to be odd, i.e. h(x) = âh(âx). One can, thus, define 

{> 0, if x > 
= 0, if x = (7) 

< 0, if x < . 

To guarantee a control perturbation tininess even at high values of x, h(x) is taken to be 
bounded. Throughout, we consider g(x) = ktanh(fix) with < /3 $5 oo determining the 
function slope. 

Perturbation (6-7) is specially tuned to control equilibriums: their positions are not changed 
by the control as the latter vanishes at x = 0. Â£ = at equilibriums respectively. The above 
control does not vanish at dynamic attractors. Our aim, however, is not controlling the UPOs 
of unperturbed system existing at given parameter values, but rather the shift of a system into 
a region of desired behaviours. Energy (3) is changed so as to match energy of a desired state. 
For small oscillations, one can find amplitude p by substituting x = p sin tot into an averaged 
(over period T) energy change and solving equation 

{E) = ^j^E(t)dt=y^-x(x,x) + F(t) + g(x / x))xdt = 0. (8) 

Equation (8) describes the balance of dissipation and energy supply brought by damping, 
driving, and control forces. For general orbit defined by the infinite series of periodic modes, 
a fundamental mode as well as its harmonics should, in principle, be counted. 
In this paper, we alter the feedback strength to adjust the oscillation energy to different 
levels. The above strategy does not require any computation of control signal and, hence, 
is applicable for control as well as identification of unknown systems. 



Control and Identification of Chaotic Systems by Altering the Oscillation Energy 1 39 

Another strategy is based on a goal-oriented control of desired target. It can be applied in cases 
when the system equations are known or a desired target can be identified (say extracted from 
the system time series). The amplitude of system's natural response is derived from equation 



^J o T {- X (x,x) + F(t)))xdt 



0. (9) 



Equation (9) describes the balance of dissipation and supply of system's intrinsic energy. For 
free self-sustained oscillations, this balance is supported entirely by nonlinear damping. To 
eliminate the natural response distortion imposed by the control, the following condition must 
be satisfied: 

ijT (g( Xj x))xdt = Q. (10) 

For small oscillations, substitution of g(x, x) = fctanh(/3x) fa k(fix â j/3 3 i 3 ) into (10) yields 

/S = â . (11) 

pco 

Thus, the distortion can be minimized solely by tuning a perturbation shape. If p <C 1, j8 

should be sufficiently large so as to preserve the underlying natural response. 

Control (6-7) does not depend on the type of functions x{ x > x )> Â£(*)/ an d F(t), and, hence, can 

be applied to linear and nonlinear oscillators, to regular and chaotic dynamics. 

The approach can be easily generalized to a case of coupled oscillator networks (Tereshko et 

al., 2004b). 

3. Controlling 2-D oscillators 

3.1 Van der Pol oscillator 

Consider the van der Pol oscillator with x(x, x) = (x â \i)x and Â£(x) = x controlled by 
feedback g(x) = fctanh(/3i). Linearizing the dynamic equation (1) in the vicinity of x = 
0, one obtains the eigenvalues: Ai = (u + kfi â \J {}i + fc/3) 2 â 4) /2 and A2 = (fi + kp + 
y/(}i + kp) 2 -4) /2. At ft > and k < 0, the perturbation with k < - (l/fi)}i or j8 > (l/\k\)}i 
stabilizes the unstable equilibrium. Thus, two control strategies can be applied: (i) altering the 
perturbation magnitude; (ii) reshaping the perturbation. When f> â > 00, tanh(/3i) â âº sign(i). 
The energy change caused by the control yields g(x)x = fcsign(i') x = k \x\. This strategy 
corresponds to maximizing the rejection (injection) of the oscillation energy and is, in fact, 
the first approximation of optimal control for a van der Pol oscillator with small dissipation 
(Kolosov, 1999). 

3.2 Forced two-well Duffing oscillator 

To analyze controlling chaotic oscillators, consider the forced two-well Duffing oscillator with 
negative linear and positive cubic restoring terms: 

x + ex- x + x 3 = b cos cot + fctanh(^i) . (12) 

In unperturbed system, at e = 0.3, cv = 1.2, and b < 0.3, the "particle" become trapped into 
other left or right potential well oscillating around x = â 1 and x = 1 respectively (or tending 
to these stationary states when b = 0). At b > 0.3, the particle is able to escape the wells, its 
irregular wandering between two potential wells corresponding to chaotic oscillations. Taking

the linear approximation tanh(/3i) m fix, obtain Â£ = ((â e + fc/5)i + bcoso;f))i. At small /3's, 
the control action is, thus, equivalent to linear adjustment of the oscillator damping. With 
increasing /3, the influence of the perturbation nonlinearity respectively increases. 
Let us fix the amplitude k and change only the perturbation slope /3. This induces the double 
action: (i) reshaping the perturbation, and (ii) changing its effective amplitude k e r. Increasing 
the slope leads to the increase of k e r (it changes from to k when /3 changes from to oo). 
As a result, when k < the sequential stabilization of orbits of the period-doubling cascade 
occurs in the reverse order (Fig. 1). These orbits are stabilized at relatively small /3 and k. 
Around jS = 1, the coexisting orbits multiple of period 3 appear. They can be eliminated 
by the slow modulation of either k or h. The similar effect of reverse period-doubling is 
reached at increasing e. However, suppressing the oscillations (to a state where the trajectory 
remains in the vicinity of either 1 or -1) occurs only at extremely high e. Hereupon, the 
system dynamics becomes overdamped, which requires extremely long transitional times. In 
contrast, the perturbations with large /3 effectively suppress the oscillations when k remains 
relatively small (Fig. 2). Note, the requirement for large /3 follows from condition (11): when 
p â âº 0, f> â* oo. Unlike stabilization of stationary points in unforced oscillators, the system 
trajectory slightly deviates around the controlled point (with the amplitude less than 10~ 3 in 
Fig. 2), and the control, hence, does not vanish there. This happens because stationary points 
in forced oscillators are not the invariants of dynamics and become these only at zero forcing. 
Figure 3 demonstrates the entrainment between the feedback force at very small and large /3's, 
when stabilizing the period-1 orbit and the stationary point respectively, and the driving force 
waveforms. The larger /3 the better the perturbation force waveform fits (in anti-phase) the 
driving force to suppress the latter. Tuning the phase and the shape of perturbation to their 
driving force counterparts is equivalent to combining the driving and the perturbation forces 
into the one effective force F e t = (b + k) cos cot. 

Changing the perturbation phase on the opposite one leads to the increase of the averaged 
oscillation energy allowing the UPOs corresponding to the higher values of energy (2) be

stabilized. Figure 4 demonstrates the stabilization of period-5 orbit. The similar strategy can 
destabilize the initially stable system by shifting it to the chaotic regions. 

3.3 Forced van der Pol oscillator 

Controlling chaotic oscillators with nonlinear damping shows the clearly different scenarios 
of the control. Let us analyze the forced van der Pol oscillator: 



x + e(x â }i)x + x = bcoscvt + fctanh(/3i) 



(13) 



In the unperturbed system, no regularity is observed at e = 5, fl = 1, b = 5 and u) = 2.463 
(Fig. 5(a)). At small enough /3, obtain E = ( â e(x 2 â {}i + e~ 1 kfl))x + Â£>cos(a;t) )x. Unlike the 
previous case, even a weak control perturbation changes nonlinearly the oscillator damping. 
One can expect the markedly different manifestations of the control at small and large /3, 
respectively. Indeed, the control with k < decreases the negative damping term, which 
leads to stabilization of the period-3 and the period-1 orbits (Fig. 5(b)). These orbits are 
different from the orbits stabilized by decreasing the driving force amplitude. We compared 
the stabilized orbits and their unperturbed counterparts. To stabilize the period-1 orbit, the 
control perturbation induces the shift of y. to fi 1 = }i â e kfi (see Fig. 5(b)). As predicted 
by the theory, the stabilized orbit and the unperturbed orbit that corresponds to this shift 
coincide. For orbits with more complicated shapes, the stabilized orbits trace closely their 
unperturbed counterparts. 

With the increase of /3, the control perturbation begins to affect the driving force term. Figure 
5(c) demonstrates the stabilization of period-5 orbit corresponding to the lower amplitudes of 
driving force.

3.4 Coupled oscillators 

Consider controlling the network of n oscillators coupled via the mean field. As the network 
element, take the forced van der Pol-Duffing oscillator, an oscillator with the van der Pol 
nonlinear damping and the modified Duffing restoring force containing only the cubic term. 
This oscillator describes the dynamics of nonlinear circuit (Ueda, 1992). Let us assume that 
the oscillators are identical but their coupling strengths are randomly varied, and only single 
element of the network is subjected to the control. The oscillator with the weakest coupling 
strength is least affected by the mean field, and, hence, is most preserving own intrinsic 
dynamics. We apply the control to this oscillator. The oscillator network equations, thus, 
read

(14) 



where; = arg { min (|ai|, |Â«2|/-v Wn\) }, I = 1,2, ..,n, 1 ^ j. 

For single oscillator, the dynamics is chaotic at e = 0.2, v = 8, co = 1.02, and b = 0.35 
(Ueda, 1992). Coupling 10 chaotic oscillators by the connections with strengths varied 
randomly according to the Gaussian distribution (with the mean equal to 0, and the variance 
and the standard deviation equal to 1) produces various dynamics. Figure 6 demonstrates 
the averaged trajectory of the network that reveals all futures of chaotic behaviour. The 
perturbation decreasing the averaged oscillation energy, being applied to the most weakly 
connected oscillator, stabilizes the network dynamics. Controlling, in opposite, the most 



where function 



Control and Identification of Chaotic Systems by Altering the Oscillation Energy 1 45 

strongly connected oscillator leads to the similar results requiring, however, much larger 
control amplitudes. 

We performed the simulations of higher dimensional networks. For 50 oscillator network with 
random normally distributed coupling strengths, the control perturbation applied to the most 
weakly coupled oscillator is found to stabilize the dynamics. 

4. Controlling 3-D oscillators 

4.1 Colpitts oscillator 

The chaotic attractors have been observed in several electronic circuits. One of such circuit 
is the Colpitts oscillator (Baziliauskas, 2001; De Feo, 2000; Kennedy, 1994). It consists of a 
bipolar junction transistor (the circuit active nonlinear element) and a resonant L-C circuit. 
The oscillator is widely used in electronic devices and communication systems. 
The Colpitts oscillator dynamics can be described by the following dynamical system 
(Baziliauskas, 2001): 

* = y - /(*) 

y = c â x â by â z (15) 

ez = y â d 

-a(z + l), z < -1, 
0, z>-l, 

dimensionless variables x and z correspond to circuit's capacitor voltages, and variable y 
corresponds to circuit's inductor current, a, b, c, d are the dimensionless parameters. This 
model is equivalent to the so-called ideal model of the circuit (De Feo, 2000). It maintains, 
however, all essential features exhibited by the real Colpitts oscillator. For z < â 1, the 
transistor works in its forward-active region, while for z Js â 1, it is cut-off. 
Substituting y = ez + d to the second equation of (16), obtain 

ez + ebz + z = c â bdâ x 
x = -fix) + ez + d . (16) 

To apply the above approach, one need to add feedback g(x) to the first equation of system 
(16). For the above oscillator, the change of energy (2) caused by this control yields zg{z). If 
g(z) takes form (6-7), the latter term always provides the increase (decrease) of the oscillation 
energy for positive (negative) perturbation magnitudes. We, thus, consider g{z) = k tanh(/3z). 
Taking z = i(y â d), obtain the control feedback to apply to the second equation of system 
(16): 

g(y) = *tanh(ijS(y-d)). (17) 

Perturbation (17) is specially tuned to control the equilibrium of system (16). Figure 7 
demonstrates the latter, k is chosen to be negative, which results in decreasing the averaged 
oscillation energy. 

Note, the stationary point exists only in the forward-active region. Unlike, the periodic orbit 
trajectories spend most of their times in the cut-off region. The circuit oscillations are balanced, 
thus, not around the above stationary point but rather around the total collector voltage 
equilibrium. The latter is proportional to x + z. Let us consider e = 1 and define w = x + z. In

To control circuit's periodic orbits, the second equation of system (16) should be exposed to 
the latter feedback. 

Figures 8 and 9 demonstrate controlling the oscillator periodic orbits. At k = 0, the system 
exhibits chaotic oscillations (Fig. 8(a), grey line). Let us apply the feedback that decreases the 
oscillation energy. Strengthening its force, one sequentially stabilizes the orbits corresponding 
to the windows of chaotic attractor and then the period-doubling orbits of main cascade in 
their reverse order. At k ~ â0.009, one obtains the period-3 orbit corresponding to the largest 
window of chaotic attractor (Fig. 8(a), bold black line). The period-8, -4, -2, and -1 orbits 
are stabilized at k ~ â0.11, â0.12, â0.14, â0.22 respectively. Figure 8(b) demonstrates the 
stabilized period-4 (solid line) and the period-1 (dot-dashed line) orbit respectively. 
Increasing the oscillation energy leads to the stabilization of orbits corresponding to these 
energy levels. As example, Fig. 9 demonstrates the stabilization of so-called 2-pulse orbit. 



148 Chaotic Systems 

We also considered a chain (ring) of 10 Colpitts oscillators with the diffusion-type couplings 
(with coupled emitters and collectors of the circuit transistor (Baziliauskas, 2001)). Different 
UPOs were stabilized with control perturbations applied to only single oscillators. 

4.2 Chua's oscillator 

Let us consider controlling a system that produces two major mechanisms of chaotic 
behaviour in continuous systems â the RSssler and the Lorenz types. This system is the 
Chua's circuit, an autonomous electronic circuit modelled by equations (Chua et al., 1986; 
Wu, 1987): 

* = Â«(y -/(*)) 

y=x-y+z+ g{y) (20) 

z = -by 

where function f(x) = m\X + MtriQ â m\)(\x + 1| â \x â 1|) , a is the bifurcation parameter, 
and g(y) is the control perturbation. 

We take b = 15, mo = â\, and m\ = 2. With increasing a in the unperturbed system, the 
steady states, (x' s ' = p,J/' s ' = 0, z( s ' = â p) and its symmetric image (x^ s > = â p,y' s ) = 

0, z' s ' = p), where p = m '"' , become unstable, and a limit cycle arises through the 

Andronov-Hopf bifurcation. Further increasing the bifurcation parameter leads firstly to the 

Rossler-type chaos through the period-doubling cascade, and then to merging two Rossler 

bands and to forming the double scroll attractor (Chua et al., 1986). The oscillation amplitude 

grows as a increases. 

Substituting y = â | to the second equation of (20) and assuming g(y) to be the odd function, 

obtain 

2 

z +z + bz = âbx + bg(-) 

x = a(- Z --f(x)). (21) 

For oscillator (21), the change of energy caused by the control yields bzg( |). If g( |) takes form 
(6-7), the latter term always provides the increase (decrease) of the oscillation energy for the 
positive (negative) perturbation magnitudes. We, thus, consider g(|) = A:tanh(/3|). Taking 
into account that z = âby and considering the limit /3 â âº oo, obtain the following control term: 

g(y) = k sign(y) . (22) 

At negative k, perturbation (22) reduces the oscillation energy. The increase of perturbation 
amplitude recovers all lower energy repellors of system (20). Figure (10) demonstrates the 
bifurcation diagram of system (20) at a = 9. Here, we considered only the trajectories 
corresponding to the right hand wing of the attractor. The unperturbed system exhibits the 
chaotic behaviour that corresponds to the screw-type chaos of the Rossler band attractor. At 
0.0083 < k < 0.0097, the orbits of period 3 â  2',i = 0,1,2... (in the reverse order beginning 
with the highest period) are stabilized. These orbits correspond to the largest window of the 
Rossler band. As known, this window separates the two different types of R5ssler chaos in 
Chua's circuit, the screw- type chaos and the spiral chaos. At the higher amplitudes of control 
perturbation, the behaviour becomes converted to the spiral chaos featuring, thus, the control 
of chaotic repellor. The further increase of control amplitude leads firstly to the sequential 



Control and Identification of Chaotic Systems by Altering the Oscillation Energy 



149 



stabilization of 2', i = 0, 1,2... orbits (these UPOs are controlled at 0.0193 < k < 0.0392, again, 
in the reverse order beginning with the highest period orbit) and finally to the stabilization 
of the steady state corresponding to the controlled band (Fig. 11). In the latter case, the 
perturbation evolves to the high-frequency periodic oscillations controlling the stationary 
state. One can draw a clear parallel between this case and the stabilization of unstable 
equilibrium in a rapidly oscillating field, which is the classical example of physics (Landau 
& Lifshitz, 1976). 

The last example demonstrates the self-tuning nature of given control. Indeed, to stabilize the 
periodic orbits, the perturbation evolves to the required resonant one. Unlike, when controls 
the chaotic repellors, the perturbation switches chaotically between âk and k.

In the nonchaotic regimes, one can apply the similar strategy. Consider, for example, a = 8, 
which corresponds to the period-1 oscillations. Taking positive k and increasing it, the system 
will be driven to the higher energy states. As a result, all these states can be controlled, namely: 
the period-doubled orbits, the repelling Rossler band and double scroll, and the UPOs of latter 
repellors. 

Consider now the double scroll attractor (a = 10, Fig. 12(a)). At negative k, strengthening the 
perturbation decreases the oscillation energy, allowing to control the lower energy repellors. 
Figure 12(b) illustrates the control of UPO corresponding to a window of the double scroll. 
At the higher amplitude of control perturbation, one observes the reverse bifurcation of 
the double scroll birth when the trajectories from two loci diverge and form two separate 
odd-symmetric Rossler bands. Depending on the locus where the control is turned on, one 
or another band can be controlled. Figure 12(c) illustrates controlling the right-hand Rossler 
band. Increasing the control amplitude, one stabilizes sequentially the period-doubling orbits 
in their reverse order. Fig. 12(d) shows controlling the period-4 orbit. The further increase 
of control amplitude leads to the stabilization of steady states. However, the unstable steady 
states can be controlled by a weaker perturbation, if the control is turned on in the vicinity of

these states. To control the UPOs corresponding to the lower energy levels, the perturbation 
decreasing the oscillation energy, i.e. one with the positive k, should be applied. 

5. Controlling reaction-diffusion media 

The above strategy can be generalized to control the pattern dynamics in the 
spatially-extended systems. Consider a general reaction-diffusion system: 

a F = Â«")+a ? - (23) 

This equation possesses a special solution of the form u = u(r â ci), where c is the wave 
speed, called a travelling wave (23). Taking new variable Q = r â ct, obtain 

u + cu + I (u) = (24) 

where all derivatives are taken over q. Perturbation (6-7) is able to effectively increase 

or decrease the oscillation energy of travelling wave enhancing or suppressing the latter 

respectively. 

Let us consider an excitable medium. It is characterized by the existence of the only 

equilibrium, the resting state, yet being perturbed the system trajectory is able to spend a 

substantial time outside of the equilibrium, in the firing state. Let us augment equation (23) 

with new "recovery" variable V that allows the system dynamics to return to its resting state: 

v = tp(u,v) (25) 

Assuming the existence of travelling wave solution, throughout we consider the following 
system: 

u + cu + Â£ (Â£(w) + <p (u,v)) =0 

v+-xp(u,v) =0. (26) 

Typically, cp(u,v) and ip(u,v) are the linear combinations of u and v, and ^(u,v) is a 
nonlinear function. The most known examples of nonlinear kinetics in the excitable media 
are represented by functions f (m) = u â jM and f (u) = Â©(u â S) where is the Heaviside 
step function. The latter is equal to 1 when v exceeds the threshold value S, and otherwise. 
These choices belong to the classical FitzHugh-Nagumo (FitzHugh, 1961) and Rinzel-Keller 
(Rinzel & Keller, 1973) models respectively. 

To control the travelling waves, we apply the control perturbation to the right-hand side of 
the first equation of system (26): 

U + cii + Â£(Â£(u) + q>(u,v)) = fctanh(^w) . (27) 

The latter is, in fact, the introduction of some form of nonlinear damping into the system. 
For small f>, the linear approximation yields tanh(/3ii) ~ /3 u, and the control reduces to the 
adjustment of the travelling wave speed: 

u+(c- kftu + Â£(Â£(m) + q>(u,v)) = . (28) 



152 Chaotic Systems 

The distributed version of the above control can be directly applied to system (23), viewing it 
as a spatially distributed overdamped oscillator. Note, Q is the function of both t and r giving 
the opportunity for the two types of control. The first type reads: 

du â, , d 2 u , , . , / âdu 



Generally, k is the function of r and t. Throughout, however, we demonstrate the efficiency 
of the spatially localized perturbations with the constant in time amplitudes. In the limit of 
small j6 and constant k, the control reduces to the simple timescale and diffusion coefficient 
adjustments: 

WSV OO) 



dt (1-fc/S) V dr 2 

Unlike the adjustment of the travelling wave speed in (28), the above one affects the whole 
right-hand side of the equation and, hence, must be bounded to kfi < 1 (unless one intends to 
drastically modify the system). 
The second type of control reads: 

|^( M) + g +fc (r, f )tanh(^). (3!) 

Here, the last term is nothing but the nonlinear flow, which, in the limit of small /3, tends to its 
linearized version. 

When suppressing the travelling waves in excitable media, after some period of exposition, 
the control can be switched off. Indeed, the rest state is the stable equilibrium here, and the 
perturbation should only be imposed while the trajectory is out of its basin of attraction. 
Below, consider the above control on the examples of two models of excitable 
reaction-diffusion media. 

5.1 Distributed FitzHugh Nagumo model 

This system is the approximation of Hodgkin-Huxley model (Hodgkin & Huxley, 1952) of the 
propagation of voltage pulses along a nerve fibre. The dynamics is described by the system of 
coupled equations (Scott, 1975): 

du 1 n d 2 u 

Yt =u -r - v+i+ ^ 

dv 

â = a(u - av + b) (32) 

at 

where u represents the local electric potential across the cell membrane and v represents 
the conductivity of the voltage-sensitive ionic channels. Parameters Q, a and b represent 
the membrane's current, radius and resistivity respectively, and parameter a constitutes the 
temperature factor. 

5.1.1 Excitable regime 

When looking for a travelling wave solution, the problem reduces to solving the ODEs 
equations:

cii + u â -M 3 â V + L = 



â -(u-av + b) . (33)

The forced-free system, i.e. one with < = 0, demonstrates the transition to chaos with the 
decrease of c (Fig. 13). Obviously, the linear damping control (28) will stabilize the dynamics. 
More efficient, however, to utilize the nonlinearity of sigmoid-type control perturbation as in 
(27). Fig. 14 illustrates the control of various period orbits by the tanh-perturbation. 
The similar strategy is applied to the periodically driven system. When the membrane is 
subjected to the periodic current, i.e. / = pcos(cot), system (33) demonstrates the chaotic 
behaviour as well as its driven-free analogue (Rajesekar & Lakshmanan, 1994). Fig. 15 
illustrates the control of above system. 

5.1.2 Oscillatory regime 

Fig. 16 illustrates controlling the system in the oscillatory mode applying the linearized 
version of control (31). Depending on the sign of control perturbation, one can either increase 
the oscillation frequency or suppress the oscillations. 

5.2 Kahlert-Rossler model 

The Kahlert-Rossler model is a variant of the Rinzel-Keller system (Rinzel & Keller, 1973) of 
the nerve conduction (Kahlert & Rossler, 1984):

System (35) demonstrates the "screw-type" chaos at some parameter values (Kahlert & Rossler, 

1984). Applying the tanh-perturbation, the chaos is tamed to the periodic oscillations (Fig. 17). 

5.2.2 Oscillatory regime 

The adjustment of system's timescale and diffusion rate can stabilize the dynamics. Fig. 18(a) 
illustrates the emergence of low-frequency stabilizing modulation. Changing kf> leads to 
different patterns. Fig. 18(b) illustrates the temporal dynamics at the system middle point, 
i.e at r = 1/2 where / is the system size. 



6. Discussion and conclusions 

The two control strategies are found to be effective: (i) altering a perturbation magnitude; 
(ii) reshaping a perturbation. In the majority of considered cases, the control represents

an addition of extra nonlinear damping to a system. Depending on the level of 
perturbation nonlinearity, two different scenarios take place. Recall that simple changing the 
tanh-perturbation slope transforms the feedback from near-linear to extremely nonlinear one. 
The above controls manifests themselves in (i) changing an oscillator natural damping; (ii) 
suppressing (enhancing) an external driving force, respectively. The perturbation shape, once 
again, reveals its significance determining the control mechanisms. 

The occurrence of second scenario depends on the oscillator features. In our approach, a 
control perturbation is naturally locked to an oscillator velocity. If there is any phase shift 
between the velocity, and, hence, the control perturbation and the driving force, than a 
delayed version of control, i.e. g(x(t â t)) with a time lag T between the control perturbation 
and the driving force, will be most effective. Note, a phase of chaotic oscillator is determined 
using the approach developed in (Pikovsky et al., 1997; Rosenblum et al., 1996). When the 
phase difference between chaotic oscillations and a driving force exhibits large deviations, 
the coherence between the control action and the driving force can be destroyed. In this case 
independently on /3, the control affects only an oscillator damping. This scenario is observed, 
for example, in the "broken egg" attractor (Ueda, 1992). 

Though derived differently, in approximation x ~ T (*(0 â x {t ~ T ))/ the proposed control 
can be viewed as a continuous-delay control with saturation (or simply a continuous-delay 
control when h(x) = x) (Gauthier et al., 1994; Pyragas, 1992) adapted to the stabilization of 
fixed points. To control a fixed point, return time T must tend to 0. 

Recently our method was applied to mechanical systems where the forcing source has a 
limited available energy supply (de Souza et al, 2007). These oscillators, called non-ideal ones, 
are described by a combination of passive and active parts (the oscillator and the motor). The 
authors demonstrated the efficiency of approach applying the control altering the oscillation 
energy to the driving motor part. 

Some of the existing methods of control can be reconsidered in the light of proposed approach. 
Look at so-called active control applied for suppressing oscillations driven by the dry friction 
forces (Heckl & Abrahams, 1996). These oscillations are produced by a mass-spring system 
sliding on a moving belt. The active control represents a feedback loop which senses the mass 
velocity, passes it to a filter, then to a phase shifter, to a variable-gain amplifier, and finally 
to shaker attached to the mass. The control force is g(x,<p) = ae'^x where a is a measure for 
amplification and cf> is a phase shift. In terms of a time lag t, g(x, t) = ax(t â t). Immediately, 
one find that at cp = (t = 0), or cf> = 5 (t = y ), the active control is nothing but the proposed 
energy alteration control. No surprise that, keeping positive a, the authors found their control 
to be optimal at (p = ^ (t = ^)- hi this case, the averaged energy change brought about by 
the control decreases as (x(t)x(t â t)) = â (x 2 (t)}, which leads to recovering of lower energy 
repellors, and, generally, to the stabilization of dynamics. 

The nonfeedback control methods can be reviewed in terms of energy alteration too. The 
resonance between a controlled signal and a control perturbation is usually the general 
condition for the efficient shift of the trajectory to a desired target, or, in other words, to 
altering the system energy. The phase of perturbation is used both to fine-tune the control 
or and to switch the drive direction on the opposite one, i.e. to switch between the directions 
of energy increase and decrease (Tereshko & Shchekinova, 1998). 

An important issue is the application of control in practice. The authors in (Heckl & 
Abrahams, 1996) discussed the applications of their technique to real-life friction-driven 
oscillations, in particular, to a squeal noise. This disturbing type of noise occurs when there is 
a lateral progression of a wheel relative to a rail. The excited bending vibrations of the wheel 



158 Chaotic Systems 

are radiated in the surrounding air and heard as intensive high pitched squeal. The authors 
present an experimental set where their control technique was tested. 

A development of methods of controlling spatially-extended systems has great practical 
importance too. The considered excitable dynamics of active reaction-diffusion systems, for 
example, lies at the core of neuron functioning. Controlling the neural activity patterns can 
potentially treat mental, movement and sleep disorders, pain, and other illnesses associated 
with a neural system. 

To summarize, we developed the control based on an alteration of oscillation energy. Since 
the approach utilizes a feedback that depends solely on the output signal, it is especially 
useful when the system parameters are inaccessible or hardly adjustable. The particular type 
of perturbation is rather relative â most important, it should comply with condition (5), 
which guarantees the monotonic change of a system oscillation energy. Then, the repellors 
are stabilized when the energy passes levels corresponding to their stable counterparts.

1. Introduction 

Since Ott et al. (1990) presented a feedback control technique for stabilizing unstable fixed 
points of chaotic maps, many linear and nonlinear control techniques based on feedback 
were introduced for chaos control of continuous and discrete dynamical systems (Fradkov 
and Evans 2005) . Consider the following dynamical systems: 

* = /(*,Â«) (1) 

*[n + l] = /(*[Â»], Â«[n]) (2) 

where x e SR" is the state vector, we9? m is the control vector and / : 5R" x9? m â Â» s Jt" is a 

sufficiently smooth function. The first equation presents a continuous time dynamical 

system and the second one a discrete dynamical system. It is assumed that both equations 

show chaotic behavior. The techniques of chaos control can be categorized based on 

different view points. 

a) open-loop and closed-loop control 

If the control action u has the following form: 

u = u(t) for continuous time system 
u = u[n] for discrete time system 

then the control strategy is called open loop. There are some works on chaos control in an 
open loop format (Fradkov and Evans 2005, Kiss et al. 2000, Parmanada and Eiswirth 1999). 
If the control action u has the following form: 

u = u(x(t)) for continuous time system 
u = u(x[n]) for discrete time system 

then it is called closed loop or feedback control. Feedback control has been frequently used 
in chaos control. The OGY control method and the delayed feedback control presented by 
Pyragas (1992, 2006) are the early works on controlling chaos via feedback. Recently, linear 
feedback control methods based on linearization and dynamic programming (Vincent and 
Yu 1991, Merat et al. 2009), nonlinear feedback control methods based on Lyapunov stability 
theory (Alasty and Salarieh 2007, Salarieh et al. 2009), sliding mode control (Konishi et al. 
1998, Arjmand et al. 2008), backstepping method (Wu and Lu 2003, Yongguang and 



162 Chaotic Systems 

Suochun 2003, Yassen 2006) and some geometrical techniques (Tian and Yu 2000) have been 
widely used for chaos control in closed loop format. 

b) Model based and mode free control: 

If the control action u is calculated based on the information obtained from dynamical 
model of the system, the control technique is called model based method. There are many 
control methods applied to chaotic systems which are designed based on the system model. 
When the control action is calculated without using the system model, the control technique 
is called model free control method. The minimum entropy control of chaos (Salarieh and 
Alasty 2009, 2009) and controlling chaos on a Poincare section presented by Bonakdar et al. 
(2008) are two model free control techniques. 

c) Adaptive and Non-adaptive control: 

When a dynamical system has some unknown parameters in its describing equations, 
usually an identification algorithm is coupled with the control algorithm to provide an 
adaptive control system. In adaptive control, parameter estimation and control are 
performed simultaneously. Usually the following dynamical equations are used for 
adaptive control applications: 

x = F(x,u)& + g(x,u) (5) 

x[n + 1] = F(x[n],u[n])@ + g(x[n],u[n]) (6) 

where F(x,u) and g(x,u) are two known functions and S is a vector of unknown parameters 
which must be estimated for control application. Adaptive control is divided into two 
categories; indirect and direct methods (Astrom and Wittenmark 1994). When the system 
parameters are estimated and control action is calculated based on the estimated parameters, 
the adaptive control scheme is called indirect adaptive control. In direct adaptive control, 
controller parameters are directly updated using an adaptive law. Adaptive control has been 
used widely for controlling chaos in discrete and continuous time systems (Hua and Guan 
2004). Salarieh and Shahrokhi (2007) have proposed an indirect adaptive control scheme for 
chaotic maps to stabilize their unstable fixed points when there are some unknown parameters 
in the model of system. Direct adaptive control of a modified Chua's circuit has been 
considered by Yassen (2003). Adaptive control of delayed continuous time chaotic systems has 
been considered by Tian and Gao (1998). Zeng and Singh (1997), Liao and Lin (1999) and 
Pishkenari et al. (2007) have presented some direct and indirect adaptive controls for the 
Lorenz system. Adaptive control of the Chua circuit and the Lorenz system has been presented 
by Ge and Wang (2000) and Pyragas et al. (2004), respectively. 

Sometimes in addition to the system parameters, the functions F(x,u) and g(x,w) in Eqs. (5) 
and (6) are also unknown. In these cases the unknown functions are substituted by a series 
or a finite summation of other known functions which are called the base functions: 

F(x, M ) = IO[(x, M )r[ 

k (7) 

*(*,Â«) = I<i>Â£(*,Â«)rÂ£ 

k 

where Oj. and Â©j? are base functions which can be selected from neuro, fuzzy or neuro-fuzzy 
base functions or form polynomial functions. F k and Tf are the unknown parameters which 
are estimated adaptively. Fuzzy adaptive control of chaos has been used by many authors to 



Adaptive Control of Chaos 1 63 

stabilize unstable fixed points and periodic orbits (Chen et al. 1999). An indirect adaptive 
fuzzy control of chaos based on the sliding mode control has been presented by Layeghi et 
al. (2008). A fuzzy adaptive control of discrete time chaotic systems based on the Takagi 
Sugeno Kang fuzzy model has been proposed by Feng and Chen (2005). Adaptive fuzzy 
model based control of chaos with application to the Lorenz system has been investigated 
by Park et al. (2002). Guan and Chen (2003) have studied adaptive fuzzy control of chaos in 
presence of disturbance. 

Sometimes an adaptive algorithm is used to update the parameters of the fuzzy IF-THEN 
rules during control procedures. Wang (1993) proposed a direct fuzzy adaptive control and 
applied to chaotic systems based on updating the parameters of IF-THEN fuzzy rules of the 
inference engine. 

2. Controlling a class of discrete-time chaotic systems 

In this section an adaptive control technique applicable to a class of discrete chaotic systems 
for stabilizing their unstable fixed points is presented. The method is an indirect adaptive 
control scheme which is proposed originally by Salarieh and Shahrokhi (2007). 

2.1 Problem statement 

Consider a discrete chaotic system given below: 

x l ik + i] = fj(xik])e-f + (g](x[k])ef)u l ik], j = i,...,n (8) 

where /;(.) and g (.) j = 1,...,N are known smooth functions, and 0- and 0f , j = 1,...,N are 
unknown constant coefficients. By successive substitution (d times) the following delayed 
discrete time system is obtained: 

x.[k + d] = Fj(x[k\u[k\...,u[k + d- 2])&'j 

+ (Gl l (x[k],u[k],...,u[k + d-2])&l l )u j [k + d-l] + --- + (Gl d (x[k])Â®l d )u / [k] (9) 

j = l,...,N 

where F (.) and G ,,(.), i = \,...,d, j = 1,...,N are known smooth functions, Â© and 

C r iT 

Â©; ,, i = l,...,d, j = 1,...,N are unknown constant coefficients and u = [u 1 w 2 ... u N I . 

Equation (9) is a general delayed form of the discrete system (8) and can be used for 

stabilizing a d-cycle unstable fixed point of a discrete time chaotic system. It is assumed that 

the nonlinear coefficient of uXk + d-l]is invertible, all of the nonlinear functions are 

sufficiently smooth and the state variables are available. The main goal is to stabilize the 

given fixed points of system (9). Note that by using some numerical techniques, the fixed 

points of a chaotic system whose states are accessible can be calculated without using its 

dynamic equation (Ramesh and Narayanan 2001, Schmelcher and Diakonos, 1997) hence it 

is assumed that the fixed points of the system are obtained by a numerical algorithm 

without using the system parameters. 

2.2 Identification method 

To identify the unknown parameters of system (9), it is written in the following form:

Oj[k] = [Ff(.) (%(>,[* + rf-l] ... G^(.) M .[A;]] 7 



0, 



(Â®;r (Â®i.) r - K-r 



Using the above definitions Eq. (11) can be written as: 

r]j [k] = T j [k]@ J 
@:[k] denotes the estimate of and it is defined as: 



Â©,[*]- 



(e^mf (Â®%[k]f ... (Â® G j, d [k]) T 



The error vector can be written as: 



Â£j[k]=nj[k]-Oj[k]ej[k-i]

(12) 
(13) 

(14) 

(15) 
(16) 



To obtain the estimated parameters, Â©.[A:] , the least squares technique is used. Consider the 
following objective functions: 



Jk =ZL 1 (Vj[n]-^ T j[n]&j[k]) 2 
By differentiating Eq. (17) with respect to and set it to zero we have:

Substituting Eq. (19) into Eq. (18) yields: 

Â®j[k] = Pj[k]Z k n ^j[n]rjj[n] 

= ^/*]fc*:!Â®;[Â«>7,[Â«] + Â®j[k]T?j[k]) (20) 

= Pj[k]P- l [k - l]Â®j[k - 1] + Pjik^jikfrjik] 

Using Eq. (19) one can write: 

Pj\k - 1] = P~\k] - Â®j[k]Â® T j[k] (21) 

Substituting Eq. (21) into Eq. (20) results in: 

&j[k] = Â©j[k - 1] + Pj[k]^j[k]Sj[k] (22) 

After some matrix manipulations, Eqs. (21) and (22) can be rewritten as: 

P.[k-1]<3> \kW\kW\k-\] 
P,[k\ = P,[k-nâÂ± T J J J (23) 

P.[k-l]<t>.[k]e.[k] 

Â® / [*]=e,[*-i]+ ' \ ' ' (24) 

' i l + <S>][k]Pj[k-l]Â®j[k] { ' 

The above recursive equations can be solved using a positive definite initial matrix for P.[0] 

and an arbitrary initial vector for Â©,[0] . 

The identification method given by Eqs. (23) and (24) implies that: 

<& T j[k]&j[k-l]^>Â® T j[k]&j ask->oo (25) 

To show the property (25), note Eq. (19) implies that P[k] is a positive definite matrix. 
Define: 

Sj[k] = Â»j[k]-&j (26) 

Consider the following Lyapunov function: 

V J [k] = SJ[kVj 1 [k}5j[k] (27) 



Using Eq. (24), we have: 



Sj[k] = P j [k]Pr l [k-l]S J [k-l] (28) 



AV j[k] can be obtained as follows:

Equation (29) shows that V,[k] is a decreasing sequence, and consequently:

2.3 Indirect adaptive control of chaos 

Assume that xj = (xj[0],xj[l],...,x[[d - 1]) is the fixed point of Eq. (9) when u[k] = , i.e. 

<[O] = x;[rf] = F r (x f [O],O,...,O)0; 

or (33) 

x^k + d] = x*[k] 
The main goal is stabilizing the fixed point x . Let, 

p.[k]=\_-Fj (x[k],u[k],...,u[k + d -2])Â® F

where X i 's are chosen such that all roots of the following polynomial lie inside the unit circle. 

z d +A lZ d ^+--- + A d =0 (36) 

Assume that G 1 (x[k],u[k], ...,u[k + d-2])0 x [fc-l] ^ and consider the conrol law as given 
below: 

u f [k + d-l] = â r -, ^^ râ p (37) 

To show that the above controller can stabilize the fixed point of Eq. (9), note that from Eq. 
(25) we have:

One can write the above equation in the following form: 

Â£j[k] = F] (.) (& F [k - 1] - Â©; ) + Xti G J,(-) (Â®U k - 1 ] - Â®w)Â«[* + d ~ Â»'] 
lim Â£j[k] = 

From Eqs. (34), (35) and (39) one can obtain: 

Pj[k] - Pj[k] = Â£j [k] + Gj 4 (.)(Â®y 4 [* " !] " Â°i )+Â«[* + rf - 1] (40) 

Using Eqs. (9), (34), (35) and (37) the controlled system can be written as: 

Xj[k + d] = -p[k] + x F [k + d]- ^ 1. (xj[k +d -i]-x F [k + d - i]\ 

G T ,(x[k],u[k],..âtAk + d -2])& G , (41) 



Gj 1 (x[Â£],w[Â£],...,M[Â£ + rf-2])Â©Â° 1 [Â£-l] 

Using Eq. (40) in Eq. (41), we have: 

Xj[k + d] - -p[k] + Â£j[k] + x F [k + d] - ^ /I,. (x, [A: + <i - z] -x F [k + d- i])

After some manipulations we get: 

x Ak + d] = x F [k + d] - Y?i=\^i(. x j\k + d -i]- x F [k + d - /]) + sAk] (43) 

or, 

( Xj [k + d]- x F j[k + d]) + ZtiM x ji k + d-i]~ x F [k + d- /]) = Sj[k] (44)

Eq. (44) can be re-written as:

Equation (45) can be written as: 

Y[k + \] = GY[k] + HÂ£j[k] 
Taking z-transform from both sides of Eq. (48) we get: 



Taking inverse yields: 



Y(z) = (zl - GY x zY(0) + (zl - Gy l HsAz) 



Y(k) = G k Y[0] + z~\(zl - Gy l Hsj(z)] 



(47)

(49) 



(50) 



Note that lim G Y[0] = as k â > co (because all eigen-values of G lie inside the unit circle), 
besides lim sAk] = as k â > co and G is a stable matrix therefore: 



lim z-\{zI-Gy l HsAz)\=Q 



(51) 



Consequently we have: 



lim Y[k] = 0^>x i \k]^x^[kl...,x i [k + d-l]->x^[k + d-l] (52) 

t->00 J J J J 

From Eq. (52) the stability of the proposed controller is established. 
Remark 1 

In practice, control law (37) works well but theoretically there is the remote possibility of 
division by zero in calculating u[.] . This can be easily avoided. For example u[.] can be 
calculated as follows:

Remark 2 

For the time varying systems, least squares algorithm with variable forgetting factor can be 
used. The corresponding updating rule is given below (Fortescue et al. 1981):

and < A min < 1 usually set to 0.95. 



2.4. Simulation results 

In this section through simulation, the performance of the proposed adaptive controller is 
evaluated. 

Example 1: 

Consider the logistic map given below: 



x[k + 1] = /J x[k] ( 1 - x[k] ) + u[k] 



(57) 



For // > 3.567 and u[k] = the behavior of the system is chaotic. In this example stabilization 
of the 2-cycle fixed point of the following logistic map is considered. In this case the 
governing equation is: 



x[k + 2] = n 2 x[k] - {// + ^)x 2 [k] + 2f?x\k] - /?x A [k] 

+ jUu[k]-2{i x[k]u[k] + 2/j x [k]u[k]-/M [k]+u[k + 1] 



(58) 



and the system fixed points for fx = 3.6 are x F [l] = 0.8696, x F [2] = 0.4081 and for // = 3.9 are 
x F [l] = 0.8974, x F [2] = 0.3590 . Equation (58) can be written in the following form:

(59) 



It is assumed that the system parameter fx changes from n = 3.6 to ju = 3.9 at k = 150 . 
The results are shown in Figs. (1) and (2). As can be seen the 2-cycle fixed point of the 
system is stabilized and the tracking error tends to zero, although the parameter estimates 
are not converged to their actual values. 

Example 2: 

For the second example, the Henon map is considered, 



x x \k + 1] = 1 - ax y [k] + x 2 [k] + u x \k~\ 
x 2 [k + 1] = bx { [k] + u 2 [k] 



(60) 



where for a = 1.4 ,b = 0.3 and u^k] = u 2 [k] = the behavior of the system is chaotic. The 1- 
cycle fixed point is regarded for stabilization. Equation (60) can be written in the following 



form: 



x i [k + \] = f l T {x i [k],x 2 [k])Â®{+gl{x l [k],x 2 [k])Â®*u l [k] 
x 2 [k + 1] = // { Xl [k],x 2 [k]) Â®{ + g\ { Xi [k],x 2 [k])Â®fu 2 [k] 



(61) 



where, 



/ 1 (jq[t],x 2 [t]) = [l x 2 [k] x 2 [k]] T 
G 1 {x l [k],x 2 [k]) = \, 



f 2 ( Xl [k],x 2 [k]) = \ 
G 2 { Xl [k],x 2 [k]) = \ 



and 



Â®{ = [o{> o( 2 e{ 3 J , Â®{ = e( , Â®f = ef , i = i,2 



(62) 



(63) 



Again the 1-cycle fixed point is obtained, using numerical methods, 
(x t =0.6314, x 2 =0.1894) . Figures (3) and (4) show the results of applying the proposed 
adaptive controller to the Henon map. It is observed that the 1-cycle fixed point of the 
system is stabilized. 

It must be noted that if in the system model the exact functionality is not know, a more 
general form with additional parameters can be considered. For example system (61) can be 
modeled as follows: 



f i (x l [k],x 2 [k]) = g i (x l [k],x 2 [k]) 

= 1 x t [k] x 2 [k] x 2 [k] x t [k]x 2 [k] xl[k]\

3. Controlling a class of continuous-time chaotic systems 

In this section a direct adaptive control scheme for controlling chaos in a class of 
continuous-time dynamical system is presented. The method is based on the proposed 
adaptive technique by Salarieh and Alasty (2008) in which the unstable periodic orbits of a 
stochastic chaotic system with unknown parameters are stabilized via adaptive control. The 
method is simplified and applied to a non-stochastic chaotic system. 

3.1 Problem statement 

It is assumed that the dynamics of the under study chaotic system is given by: 



x = f(x) + F(x)0 + G(x)u 



(66) 



174 Chaotic Systems 

where x e 9i" is the state vector of the system, 6 e W" is the vector of the system 
parameters, u e 5R" is the control vector,/ eC^iR'/Ji") , F eC 1 (iR",iR" xra ) and for all x 
|F(x)|| 2 < M , where M is a positive constant, i.e. F is bounded, and G e C^V-H"*") . The 
Unstable Periodic Orbit (UPO) of chaotic system (66) with w = is denoted by x , and 
consequently we have: 

t = f(x) + F(x)0 (67) 

It is assumed that all states of the chaotic system are available, G is invertible, functions 
/ , F and G are known, and the system parameters, 6 , are unknown. The main objective is 
designing a feedback direct adaptive controller for stabilizing the unstable periodic orbit, x 
such that: 

||x-x| â >0, as t â >oo (68) 

3.2 Direct adaptive control of chaos 

By using the following theorem, a direct adaptive controller can be designed which fulfills 
the above objective: 

Theorem 

Let e = x â x and k > r than the control and adaptation laws given by: 

u = -G-'(x)[f(x)-f(x) + (F(x)-F(x))a + t]sign(e) + ke] (69) 

a=[F(x)-F(x)] T e ( 70 ) 

make the UPO defined by Eq. (67) asymptotically stable. 

â  

Note that the sign function in Eq. (69), acts on each elements of the xâX vector. 

Proof: 

To design a control and adaptation law, a Lyapunov function is defined as: 

K = i||x(0-x(0| 2 +|||Â«(0-4 (71) 

where a is the estimate of 6 obtained from the adaptive law (71). Differentiating both sides 
of Eq. (70) yields: 

V = (x(t)-x(t)) T (x(t)-x(t)) + (a(t)-0) T a (72) 

Using Eqs. (66), (67) and (69), Eq. (72) can be written as: 

F = (x-x) r (-(F(x)-F(x))(Â«-0)-^gÂ«(x-x)-/t(x-x)) + (a(O-0) 7 '[i ; '(x)-F(x)f(x-x) 

â âk e -?7|e| 

Since y is negative semi-definite, so the closed-loop system is stable, and e = x - x and x are 
bounded. In addition e is bounded too, because it satisfies the following equation:

175 



e = x â x = F(x)0 + f(x) â(F(x) â F(x))a ârjsignye)â k eâx 
in which /(.) and F(.) are continuous functions. From Eq. (73) we have 

-J V{t)dt =Uk ||ef +T]\e\)dt = V(0) - f (Â°o) < <x> 



(74) 



(75) 



Since eel ft L* 1 and e s Lâ¢ , due to Barbalat's Lemma (Sastry, Bodson 1994) we have 

lim e(t) = => lim x(t) = x{t) 



(76) 



3.3 Simulation results 

In this section the presented controller has been used for stabilizing the UPOs of the Lorenz, 
and the Rossler dynamical systems. 

Example 1: Stabilizing a UPO of the Lorenz system: 

The Lorenz system has the following governing equations: 



(77) 



where x-j , x 2 and x 3 are the state variables, 1 , 2 and 3 are unknown parameters. For 
1 = 16 , 2 = 45.92 , 3 = 4 and w, = , the Lorenz system shows chaotic behavior, and one of 
its UPOs is initiated from x^O) = 19.926 ,x 2 (0) = 30.109 and x 3 (0) = 40 with the period of 
T= 0.941, as shown in Fig. (6). The presented adaptive control is applied to the Lorenz 
dynamical system. Figure (7) shows the states dynamics in the time-domain and in the 
phase space. The control actions are shown in Fig. (8).

For X =0.2 , 2 =0.2 , 6* 3 = 5.7 and u, :=0 , the system trajectories are chaotic. The system 
behavior in the phase space and one UPO of the system are shown in Fig. (9). In this case the 
UPO has the period of T = 5.882 which is obtained from the initial condition x 1 (0) = 0,

x 2 {0) = 6.089 and x 3 (0) = 1.301. The presented adaptive control scheme is applied to the 
system for stabilizing the UPO shown in Fig. (9). Simulation results are shown in Figs. (10) 
and (11). Figure (10) shows that the system trajectories converge to the desired UPO. 

4. Fuzzy adaptive control of chaos 

In this section an adaptive fuzzy control scheme for chaotic systems with unknown 
dynamics is presented.

where X = [x lr x 2 ,..., x n ] = [x,X,...,X^ n ~ '] is the system state vector, u e SR is the control 

vector,/ eC (SR n ,SR)andg eC (5Râ¢, 3?) . It is also assumed that /(.)is an unknown function 

but g(.) is a known function. 

The Unstable Periodic Orbit (UPO) of chaotic system (79) with w = is denoted by X , 

therefore: 



* {n) =f(X) 



(80) 



The main objective is to design a feedback direct adaptive controller for stabilizing the 
unstable periodic orbit, X . It is also assumed that all state variables are available for 
controller design. 

4.2 Fuzzy estimation of f ( X) 

Since /(.) is not known, a fuzzy system is used to estimate it. /(.) can be estimated as: 



/(X)=X^4(X) = r O(X) 



(81) 



where /(.) is the fuzzy estimation of /(.) and 



a>(X) = [^(x),...,4(x)] T 

(.) functions have the following form: 



(82) 



A(*> 



1=1 



(83) 



where /^(x,) is the output of fuzzy membership function for i th input argument. Fuzzy 
systems (81) and (83) are obtained using singleton fuzzifier and product inference engine 
(PIE) and center average defuzzifier. According to the universal approximation theorem of 



Adaptive Control of Chaos 



179 



Fuzzy systems, for sufficiently large N, i.e. the number of fuzzy rules, one can estimate /(.) 
such that for every St > the following inequality holds: 



â¢(X)-f(X)\\ <e f 



(84) 



The optimum vector parameter which satisfies Eq. (84) is denoted by O , and its 
corresponding estimated /(.) is denoted by f (.) . 

4.3 Direct fuzzy adaptive control scheme 

The following theorem provides an adaptive control law for system (79). 

Theorem 2 

Let E = X-X and select ju t , i = 0,l,...,n -1 such that all roots of equation 

s"+// s"~ h v /u n _ 1 =Q have negative real parts. Consider the control and adaptation 

laws:

where B =[0 ... l]and P is a positive definite symmetric matrix that satisfies the 
Lyapunov equation A P + PA = -Q with any arbitrary positive definite and symmetric

Differentiating both sides of Eq. (89) yields:

Using Eq. (87), Eq (91) can be rewritten as: 

E=AE+B[f{X)-f\X)) 
Substituting Eq. (92) and the adaptation law (86) into Eq. (90) get: 

V=[E T A T +[f(X)-f\X))B T yE+E T p[AE+B[f(X)-f\X))\ + {Â®-& o ) T ^{X)B T PE

Adding and subtracting an f (.) in the above equation results in 

V =E T (A T P+PA)E+2{f(X)-f o (X)+f o (X)-f(X)}B T PE+(Â®-Â®J<S>(X)B T PE

4.4 Simulation results 

The above described control scheme is used to control states of the modified Duffing 
system. Consider the following modified Duffing system: 



x 2 = ax, + fix^ + Sx 2 + f cos t + (3 + cos x 1 )ii 



(100) 



The system shows chaotic behavior for a =1, fi = â1 , S = -0.15 , f Q = 0.3 and w = . For this 
system g(X) = 3 + cosx 1 . The objective is to force the state variables to track the desired 
trajectory using adaptive control scheme described in the previous section. For a = 1 , 
P = â\, 5 = -0.15 , f = 0.3 , the Duffing system (100) has periodic orbits with ^- n -period 
(Fig. (12)) which is selected as desired trajectory in simulation study.

5. Conclusion 

In this chapter adaptive control of chaos has been studied. Indirect and direct adaptive 
control techniques have been presented, and their applications for chaos control of two 
classes of discrete time and continuous time systems have been considered. The presented 
methods have been applied to some chaotic systems to investigate the effectiveness and 
performance of the controllers. In addition a fuzzy adaptive control method has been 
introduced and it has been utilized for control of a chaotic system.

1. Introduction 



Chaotic neural networks seized attention of scientists from various points of view due to the 
amazing effects they produce. Phenomenology of structure formation in nature inspired 
scholars to mimic complex and with the same time quasi-optimal solutions to generate 
artificial systems with similar capabilities. One of the dominant ways to provide collective 
dynamics of previously unordered elements is self-synchronization that happens without 
any outside enforcement. 

In theory of dynamic chaos and chaotic synchronization were discovered different types of 
synchronous behaviour of coupled dynamic systems: complete, lag, generalized, phase, 
time-scale, frequency, partial synchronizations (Pikovsky & Maistrenko, 2008; Anishchenko 
& et. al., 2007; Koronovskii & Maistrenko, 2009; Fujisaka & Shimada, 1997, Kapitaniak & 
Maistrenko 1996; Kurths & et. al., 1997). Most of the results were obtained by computer 
modelling and visualization techniques. Unpredictable and instable long time period 
behaviour stems from peculiarities of elements self-dynamics governed by deterministic 
function that predetermine chaotic behaviour (Lyapunov coefficients are positive). Research 
subject in numerous articles is collective dynamics of chaotic elements that somehow 
happens to be stable in terms of group oscillations, but vulnerable when individual 
trajectory is considered (Politi & Torcini, 2010; Liu & et. al., 2010 ; Pikovsky & et. al., 2003; 
Manrubia & Mikhailov, 1999). Strange attractors correspond to synchronous clusters 
(Benderskaya & Zhukova, 2008; Chen & et. al, 2006; Anishenko & et. al., 2002). 
Extreme complexity of elements individual dynamics constrains the type of interconnection 
strength to be homogeneous in overwhelming majority of articles. Most of them consider 
dependence of synchronous regimes from strength of coupling equal for all elements. This 
limitation prevents from further generalization of results and makes them to be partial 
solutions. In most recent researches are considered heterogeneous couplings strength. 
Heterogeneous field of links between elements extends greatly the analysis complexity 
(especially mathematical analysis) but allows to reveal interesting effects (Inoue & Kaneko, 
2010; Li & et. al., 2004; Popovych & et. al., 2000). 

In this paper we consider the analysis of fragmentary synchronization of fractal waves 
generated by large dimension inhomogeneous chaotic neural network. In our previous 
papers fragmentary synchronization phenomenon was discovered and applied. Further 
research of new synchronization type shows that we can speak about fractal structure of

synchronous clusters. We propose that the fact of fractal structure existence can settle the 
problem of finding out the end of transition period in order to reduce computation 
complexity of clustering method introduced in our previous papers (Benderskaya & 
Zhukova, 2008, 2009). 

2. Chaotic oscillators 

During the last decades, the emergence of collective dynamics in large networks of coupled 
units has been investigated in disciplines such as physics, chemistry, biology, and ecology 
(Yamapi et. al., 2010; Wang et. al., 2010; Vasconcelos et. al., 2004). In particular, the effect of 
synchronization in systems of coupled oscillators nowadays provides a unifying framework 
for different phenomena observed in nature. Complex networks have recently provided a 
challenging framework for synchronization studies on dynamic objects with main focus on 
the interplay between topology complexity and local dynamic properties of coupled 
elements. A key problem is to define conditions that guarantee the stability of neurons 
synchronous behavior for this or that network topology. 
The complexity of interconnected chaotic systems comes from different directions: 

a. nonlinear dynamics of elements; 

b. exponential dependence on initial conditions; 

c. unpredictable result of the influence on nonlinear vulnerable system from other ones; 

d. insufficient mathematical apparatus that help to describe multidimensional nonlinear 
systems; 

e. computer modelling investigation methodology (the calculations precision starts to be 
critical in terms of forecasting the long term behaviour of nonlinear systems); 

All this factors predetermines the research focus mainly on the analysis of interdependent 
pair of chaotic oscillators, or on the collective dynamics of oscillators ensemble, but with 
homogeneous type of linkage (Li et. al., 2004; Popovych et. al., 2000). 

As it is hard to find formal mathematical solution for a system of multidimensional 
difference equations we can try to obtain solution by means of computer programming and 
visualizing of the results. Rapid development of computer technology extended the abilities 
of scientist to find answers with computer modeling techniques. We use different 
visualization techniques. 

2.1 Synchronization phenomenon 

Synchronization as a universal concept is thoroughly discussed in literature (Pykovski & et. 
al., 2003). One of the most important generalization of inner synchronization effects are the 
conditions that cause inner synchronous motions among groups of nonlinear elements: 

a. large amount of globally coupled nonlinear elements; 

b. weak coupling strength to exclude the possibility of several elements to suppress 

c. individual dynamics of all others; 

d. instability dynamics of each nonlinear element; 

e. feedbacks to provide own element's dynamics tuning to the neighbors' fluctuations. 
Primary results on modeling high dimensional chaotic map lattices were published by K. 
Kaneko (Kaneko, 1987, 1989). His works showed up the fact that globally coupled chaotic 
map lattices exhibit formation of ensembles synchronously oscillating elements. These 
ensembles were called clusters serving as system's attractors. If there appear to be several 
clusters then the system is characterized by multistability, when several attractors coexist in

the phase space at the same parameters values. The main focus of research in terms of 
synchronization is on the combination of systems parameters that predetermine the 
appearance of different synchronization types corresponding to functioning regimes. 

2.2 Clustering 

The fundamental research provides the basis for various applications of chaotic networks 
(Fang et. al., 2009; Herrera Martin, 2009; Hammami et. al., 2009, Mosekilde et. al, 2002). In 
this paper we apply chaotic neural network to 2D and 3D clustering problem. L. Angelini 
introduced to correspond dataset groups to dynamical oscillatory clusters by means of 
neural network parametrization (Angelini & et. al., 2000, 2001, 2003). In our previous papers 
we introduced modifications of chaotic neural network (CNN) clustering method, proposed 
by Angelini, in order to ensure better clusterization quality (Benderskaya & Zhukova, 2008, 
2009). In this paper we give the description of modified CNN model. 

3. Chaotic neural network model 

Let us consider chaotic neural network model simultaneously from several angels 
mentioned above as its complexity has many dimensions. 

3.1 Structure complexity 

CNN does not have classical inputs - it is recurrent neural network with one layer of N 
neurons. Each neuron is responsible for one object in the dataset, but the image itself is not 
given to inputs. Instead input dataset is given to logistic map network by means of 
inhomogeneous weights assignment. 



W = {w>Â«} =exp 



2Â« 



,d ir \ Xi - Xj \, i,j = l,N, (1) 



where N - number of elements, wÂ» - strength of link between elements i and j, d, - 
Euclidean distance between neurons i and j, a - local scale, depending on k-nearest 
neighbors. Influence of linkage mean field on the dynamics of CNN is demonstrated on 
Fig. 1. 

The value of a is fixed as the average distance of fc-nearest neighbor pairs of points in the 
whole system. To define nearest neighbors taking into account image topology we use 
Delaunay triangulation. Delaunay triangulation (Preparata & Shamos, 1993) gives us all the 
nearest neighbors of each point from all directions. The value of a is now fixed as the 
average distance of Delaunay-nearest neighbor pairs of points in the whole system. Thus we 
form the proper mean field that contributes greatly to convergence of CNN dynamics to 
macroscopic attractor. 
Evolution of each neuron is governed by

parameter. Neurons state is dependent on the state of all other elements. The logistic map 
with parameter A =1 predetermines the chaotic behaviour of each neuron. 
The structure of chaotic neural network (number of neurons, field of weight coefficients) 
and dynamics depends on the image size and topology. It happens to be very difficult to 
find out formal measures to forecast oscillators behaviour especially because of chaotic 
nature of each neuron. Thus we deal with N-dimensional inhomogeneous system of chaotic

oscillators that evolves in discrete time and generates continuous outputs. The main 
research method: computer modelling. 

3.2 Extreme instability of each neuron 

One of the basic models of chaotic nonlinear systems is logistic map (Peitgen, 2004). If the 
parameter is set as X =2, then strange attractor can be detected in the phase space (Fig. 3). 





Fig. 3. One neuron dynamics analysis: strange attractor is constructed when X =2. 

One of the main characteristic is exponential instability to initial conditions. The logistic 
map fully demonstrates this quality (Fig. 4). As we can see even small delta of 0.0000001 
leads to the serious trajectories' changes after 24 iterations.

Chaotic Systems 



Clusterization phenomenon stems from the chaotic oscillations of each neuron. The logistic 
map parameter A =2 guarantees chaotic dynamics of each neuron, as the eldest Lyapunov 
indicator is positive. 

3.3 Dynamical clusters and synchronization types 

In accordance with (Pykovski et al., 2003; Peitgen et al. 2004) in the ensembles of poorly 
connected identical neurons emerge synchronization of various types, depending on the 
system's parameter combination. We introduce these types on the example of CNN: 

a. complete synchronization (Fig. 5.a); 

b. imphase synchronization (Fig. 5.b); 

c. phase synchronization (Fig. 5.c, Fig. 5.d); 

d. lag synchronization (time series coincide but with some delay in time); 

e. generalized synchronization (there is some functional dependence between time series).

Fig. 5. Synchronization types of chaotic time series: (a) - complete; (b)-imphase; (c) - phase 
synchronization with slight amplitude deviations; (d) - phase synchronization of neurons 
pairs within two clusters reveal the outputs changes in the same direction but with 
significantly different amplitudes. 

Besides these well-known synchronization types we found out CNN to produce new 
synchronization type - we named it fragmentary synchronization. It is characterized by 
different oscillatory melodies-fragments (Fig 6.e, 6.f). Synchronization is no more about 
comparing separate trajectories, but about integrative consideration of cluster's music of 
fragments. 



3.4 Macroscopic attractors in oscillations 

The dynamics of a separate neuron output highly depends on initial conditions, but the 
most fruitful about CNN is its ability to form stable (independent of initial conditions) 
synchronous clusters in terms of joint dynamics of neurons. Stable mutual synchronization

193 



of neurons (points) within each cluster in terms of CNN corresponds to the macroscopic 
attractor, when we receive indifferent to initial conditions oscillatory clusters, though instant 
outputs of neurons differ greatly (Fig. 6). The complexity of mutual oscillations depends on 
the complexity of input image. Simple image comprised by 146 points (Fig 5.a) organized in 
compact groups located far from each other predetermines almost complete synchronization 
of oscillations within clusters (Fig. 6.b, 6.c). But if the image of 158 points with less compact 
topology and inter cluster distance more complex synchronization take place - fragmentary 
synchronization (Fig. 6.e, 6.f) . 

The system is stable in terms of mutual synchronous dynamics of outputs within time but 
not in terms of instant values of separate neurons.

three different oscillatory clusters from absolutely different initial conditions: (a) - simple

clusters evolving during observation period Tn=100 from different initial conditions; (d) - 
complex input dataset to be clustered; (e), (f) - 158 fragmentary synchronized outputs of 
CNN evolving during observation period Tn=100 from different initial conditions. 



3.5 Clustering technique drawback 

All the figures above demonstrate CNN dynamics statistics gathered after some transition 
period. One of the unsolved problems at the moment is finding out some formal way to 
state that transition period is over and it is time of macroscopic attractor to govern 
trajectories. We introduced some indirect approach that consists in CNN output statistics 
processing. At different level of resolution due to the theory of hierarchical data mining 
(Han, 2005) are generated dozens of clusterizations, then they are compared and the variant 
that repeats more often wins (is considered to be the answer). After that we repeat the 
procedure all over again to be sure that with the cause of time mutual synchronization 
remains to be the same. This approach is desperately resource consuming and takes dozens 
more time than generating CNN oscillatory clusters. Thus it prevents from wide application 
of CNN clustering technique especially with the growth of objects number in the input 



194 Chaotic Systems 

image (it does not matter 2D, 3D or N-dimensional), though it has a wide set of advantages 
in compare to other clustering methods. 

The novelty of this paper consists in discovering fractal structures in fragmentary 
synchronized outputs. This phenomenon encourages us to shift our focus on the direct 
analysis of outputs value and not on their desensitization with the main aim to reduce 
clustering method complexity. 

4. In pursuit of strange attractor 

The captivating interplay of oscillations within dynamical clusters that we call fragmentary 
synchronization could hardly be interpreted somehow in a numerical way. Other problem 
that seemed to have no answer is that the dependence between clustering quality and the 
size of outputs statistics is not obvious. The extensive growth of CNN states to be analysed 
sometimes was not successful in terms of clustering problem and predetermined even worse 
results than those obtained on a smaller dataset. Such observations forced us to focus mainly 
on synchronization of time-series once more in order to reveal some order in the 
macroscopic attractor, comprised by temporal sequences. The indication of macroscopic 
attractor existence is the coincidence of clustering results (synchronous dynamical clusters) 
obtained for different initial conditions. 

4.1 Fractal waves 

Under the notion of fractal coexists a wide set of structures, both of spatial and temporal 
nature that demonstrate self-similarity. The very word fractal is formed from latin fractus 
which means to consist of fragments. Broad definition tells that fractal is the structure 
consisted of the parts which are similar the whole (Mandelbrot, 1983). In the case of CNN it 
is more applicable to say that fractals are signals that display scale-invariant or self -similar 
behaviour. Fractals reflect nature as inherently complex and nonlinear according to Dardik 
(Dardic, 1995). Smaller rhythms are imbedded within larger rhythms, and those within 
larger still. The short biochemical cycles of cells of the human heart waves are embedded 
within the circadian rhythm of the whole body, and they are all embedded within the 
larger waves of weeks, months and years. Fractal superwaves spiral in all directions as an 
inherent continuum of waves nested within other waves. Thus everything is affecting 
everything else simultaneously and casually, while everything is changing, throughout 
all scales. In terms of recurrent behaviour of CNN outputs we consider the joint dynamics of 
neurons as waves of complex form. What does it mean - self -similarity in CNN? 
We started with careful consideration of fragmentary synchronized neurons dynamics (Fig. 
7). The dynamics statistics was gathered during Tn = 2000 (Fig. 7.a). Then we focused on 
first counts (states of CNN represented on the figure by vertical lines) and visualized them 
in a more and more detailed way (Fig. 7.b-e). 

After careful consideration we noticed that there exist quasi similar fragments not only in 
terms of horizontal lines that comprise melodies, but repeating waves in the overall chaotic 
neural network (Fig. 7b., Fig. 7c). This temporal similarity leads us to the hypothesis of 
oscillations fractal structure. 

4.2 CNN fractals 

Temporal fractals as well as space fractals are characterized by self-similarity at different 
scales of consideration. But in case of CNN we deal not with geometric object, but with

fractal structure of multidimensional time-series, comprised by CNN counts. The scaling is 

done by means of time-series decimation (bolting) with different coefficient in order to 

observe CNN dynamics at various detail levels (this is similar to CNN modeling with 

different discretization time). 

Representation of CNN time-series at different scales is shown on Fig. 8. Interested in less 

detailed temporal picture we gradually decrease the scale. 

Amazing thing about the scaling on Fig. 8 is that it looks like almost the same in comparison 

to Fig. 7. On Fig. 7.b and Fig. 8.b as well as on Fig. 7.c and Fig. 8.c one can see the same 

fragments though they are viewed absolutely from different perspectives. More over the 

similarity is observed not only on small scales (1:4, 1:8) but on rather huge ones (1:20, 1:40) 

with several counts lag precision (Fig. 7.d and Fig. 8.d). 

4.3 Fractal visualization 

One of the common ways to reveal fractals is construction of phase portraits. In case of CNN 
we observe almost the same phase portrait like on Fig. 3, as individual trajectory is forced by 
logistic map to be chaotic. To investigate recurrent behaviour of complex multidimensional 
time-series recurrent analysis is applied. In case of CNN we propose to visualize trajectories 
by means of recurrence plots (RP) introduced by J.P. Eckmann (Eckmann et al., 1987, 
Romano et al., 2005). Recurrence plots visualize the recurrence of states in a phase space. 
Usually, a phase space does not have enough dimension (two or three) to be pictured. 
Higher-dimensional phase spaces can only be visualized by projection into the two or three- 
dimensional sub-spaces. However, Eckmann's tool enables us to investigate the m- 
dimensional phase space trajectories through a two-dimensional representation of its 
recurrences. Such recurrence of a state at time i at a different time j is pictured within a two- 
dimensional squared matrix with black and white dots, where black dots mark a recurrence, 
and both axes are time axes. This representation is called recurrence plot. Such an RP can be 
mathematically expressed as 

R(i,j) = Q(Eps-||x(i)-x(j)||),i,j = l,...,N (4) 

where N is the number of states x(i) (counts of CNN dynamics) , Eps is a threshold distance, 
||*|| - a Euclidean norm and Q the Heaviside step function. Recurrence plot contains 
typical small-scale structures, as single dots, diagonal lines and vertical/ horizontal lines (or 
a mixture of those). The large-scale structure, also called texture, can be visually 
characterised by homogenous, periodic, drift or disrupted. The visual appearance of an RP 
gives hints about the dynamics of the system. 

If recurrence behaviour occurs in two different time-series then synchronization takes place. 
If self-recurrent pieces are detected or similar dynamics is revealed between original time- 
series and their scaled copy then we can speak about application of RP to the analysis of 
CNN fractal temporal structure (self-similarity). 

Recurrence plots of CNN dynamics temporal structure is introduced on Fig. 9 in two ways: 
self-reflection of first counts bunches 500, 250, 100, 50 correspondingly represented on Fig. 
9.a, Fig. 9.c, Fig. 9.e, Fig. 9.h and self-reflection of scaled bunches 1:4, 1:8, 1:20, 1:40 
represented on Fig. 9.b, Fig. 9.d, Fig. 9.f, Fig. 9.h. We can see that recurrence plots of first 
bunches and scaled bunches have much in common (partly just the copy of each other). It 
happens to have no difference whether to observe first 500 counts or picture, comprised by 
decimated counts with four times magnification (every 4 th count out of 2000). This is the 
evidence for fractal structure of time-series, generated by CNN. The indicator of oscillations

periodical dynamics is the presence of diagonal lines and patterns arranged in staggered 
order. Irregular fragments speak about chaotic synchronization and quasi periodical 
character of oscillations. Dissimilar pieces of recurrence plots can also be the consequence of 
coincidence precision demands, predetermined by (4) (it is well-known practise to use 
tolerance discrepancy when analysis of multidimensional nonlinear systems with chaotic 
dynamics is conducted). By means of arrows we note the nesting similarity of different 
recurrent plots (both first and scale bunches) - evidence for fractal structure. 
Further investigation leads us to cross-recurrence analysis. The comparison of first count 
bunches and scaled count bunches is provided (Fig. 10). And again one can see self- 
similarity of results: the same as in case of recurrence plots the mutual correspondence 
among plots is detected in spite of different scaling of original CNN statistics: Fig. lO.a is 
similar to Fig. 9.b; Fig. lO.c is similar to Fig. 9.d; Fig. lO.b is similar to Fig. 9.f; Fig. 10. d is 
similar to Fig. 9.h. 

To be careful with conclusions we checked the existence of fractal nesting depth and 
compared the reflection of scaled bunch of counts into each other (Fig. 11). As for recurrence 
plots on Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 on Fig. 11 the same structure is observed accurate within small 
fragments. This verifies the importance of discrepancy thresholds not only for absolute 
values of CNN outputs coincidence but also for comparison of fragments when fragmentary 
synchronization is analyzed.

5. Conclusion 

In this paper fractal structure of fragmentary synchronization is discovered. The structure of 
fragment's and overall dynamics of CNN was investigated by means of recurrence and 
cross-recurrence plots visualization techniques. Understanding the mechanism of fragments 
interplay (periodical vertical similarity) along with oscillatory clusters interplay (horizontal 
dissimilarity of cluster's melodies) is vital for discovering the low resource consuming 
algorithm of CNN outputs processing in order to translate nonlinear language of oscillation

problem). 

Analogous fractal effects were obtained for a wide set of well-known clustering datasets. 

Further research will follow in the direction of fractal structures measurement. This is 

important to formalize the analysis of inner phase space patterns by means of automatic 

techniques for recurrence plots analysis.

Coexistence of Synchronization 
and Anti-Synchronization for Chaotic Systems

1. Introduction 

The study of chaos can be introduced in several applications as: medical field, fractal theory, 

electrical circuits and secure communication, essentially based on synchronization 

techniques. 

The synchronization for chaotic systems has been extended to the scope, such as generalized 

synchronization, phase synchronization, lag synchronization, and even anti-synchronization 

(Pecora & Carroll, 1990; Wu & Chua, 1993; Michael et al., 1996; Bai & Lonngsen, 1997; Yang 

& Duan, 1998; Taherion & Lai, 1999; Zhang & Sun, 2004; Li, 2005; Yassen, 2005; Hammami et 

al, 2009; Juhn et al., 2009; Hammami et al., 2010b). 

For an n master chaotic system coupled to an n slave one, described respectively by 

x m (t) = f(x m (t)) and by x s (t) = g(x s (t)), where x m and x s are phase space variables, and 

/(.) and g(.) the corresponding nonlinear functions, the synchronization in a direct sense 

implies that |x s (f)-x m (f)| â > as t â > +co. 

The property of anti-synchronization constitutes a prevailing phenomenon in symmetrical 

oscillators, in which the state vectors have the same absolute values but opposite signs, 

which implies that |x s (i) + x m (f)| â > as t â > +co. 

When synchronization and anti-synchronization coexist, simultaneously, in chaotic systems, 

the synchronization is called hybrid synchronization (Juhn et al., 2009). 

2. Chaotic hybrid synchronization and stability study 

Let consider the chaotic master system (S m ) described, in the state space, by: 

x m (t) = A(x m (t))x m (t) (1) 

coupled with the following forced slave system (S s ) : 

x s (t) = A(x s (t))x s (t) + B(x s (t))u(t) (2) 



204 



Chaotic Systems 



where X m and x s are the n state vectors of the considered systems (S m ) and (S s ), 
respectively, x m = \x m \ â  â  â  X mn 1 , X s = [x sl . . . x sn 1 , w the /i control vector, 
U = \Ui ... W;, , A(.) an nxn instantaneous characteristic matrix, and B(.) an nxh 
instantaneous control matrix. 
Let denote by 6c the state synchronous error: 

e S (t) = *$(t)-Xm(t) ( 3 ) 

and e<c the anti-synchronous one: 

e A s( t ) = x s(t) + x m (t) (4) 

T T 

e S=[ e Sl â â â  e Sn] > e AS=[ e ASl â¢â¢â  e ASn ] ' and consider that the hybrid 
synchronization of the two chaotic systems, (S m ) and (S S J, is achieved if the following 
conditions hold (Juhn et al., 2009): 



lim \e si (t)\= lim \x < , j (t)-x mj (t)\ = o, Vi = 1,2,.. .,p, p < n 

lim |e AS -(f)|= lim \x sj (t) + X mj (t)\ = 0, \/j = p + l,...,n 



(5) 



The satisfaction of the first relations of conditions (5) means that the synchronization 
property as far as p states of the error vector are concerned is satisfied. Nevertheless, the 
fulfilment of the second relations of the same system (5) guarantees the anti-synchronism 
relatively to the (n-p) remaining states. 

Then, the problem consisting in studying the convergence of both synchronous and anti- 
synchronous errors is equivalent to a stability study problem. 

To force this property to the error system characterizing the evolution of the error vector of 
the coupled chaotic systems, one solution is to design a suitable feedback control law u(t) of 
the slave system which can be chosen in the form, Fig. 1. (Kapitanialc, 2000): 



u(t) = -K(x s (t),x m (t))(x s (t)Ax m (t)) 



(6) 



such that, the operator A is replaced by the sign (-) in the synchronization case and by the 
sign (+) in the anti-synchronization one; K(.) is an hxn nonlinear gain matrix.

The determination of the controller's gains, intended for the hybrid synchronization of the 
dynamic coupled master-slave chaotic system, is considered in the following section. 

3. Analytic synchronization conditions of chaotic systems (Benrejeb & 
Hammami, 2008; Hammami, 2009; Hammami et al., 2010a) 

To guarantee the synchronization as well as the anti-synchronization of chaotic systems, 
proposed approaches are based on the choice of both adapted stability method and of 
system description. 

3.1 Case of nonlinear monovariable systems 

Let consider the error dynamic system described by (7) in the monovariable case: 

e{t) = A(x s {t),x m {t))e{t) + B{x s {t),x m {t))u{t) (7) 

u(t) = -K(x s (t),x m (t))e(t) (8) 

with ueR, A(.) = {^(.)}, B(.) = {&,â¢(.)}, and K(.) = [kj(.)), Vi, ; = i,...,n, and the 
characteristic matrix of the closed-loop system A(.), defined by: 

A(.) = A(.)-B(.)K(.) (9) 

Theorem 1. The system described by (7) and (8) and verifying (10): 

a lj (.)-b 1 (.)k j (.) = oVi,j = l,...,n-liori*j (10) 

such that: 

i. the nonlinear elements are located in either one row or one column of the matrix A(.), 

ii. the diagonal elements I Â«â(.)-&, (.)&,(.) I of the matrix A(.) are such that: 

(a il (.)-b,(.)k,(.))<0\/i = l,...,n-l (11) 

is asymptotically stable, if there exist s > such that: 



(0-6 B O^O)-g[|(^O-^(0^(.))(%O-M-)*i I O)|(3Â«(.)-M-)*i(.))" 



<-e (12) 



Proof. Conditions (10) lead to an arrow form closed-loop characteristic matrix A(.) 
(Benrejeb, 1980), called Benrejeb matrix (Borne et al., 2007): 



A(.) = 



X X 
X X 



(13) 



206 Chaotic Systems 

The choice of a comparison system having a characteristic matrix M(A(.)), relatively to the 

vectorial norm p(2) = riz 1 | ... IzJl , z = \z 1 ... z n ] , leads, when the nonlinearities are 

isolated in either one row or one column, to the following sufficient conditions, by the use of 
Borne-Gentina practical stability criterion (Borne & Benrejeb, 2008): 

(-i)'M(A(.))r 2 2 !j>ovÂ»=i,2,...,Â» (i4) 

This criterion, useful for the stability study of complex and large scale systems generalizes 

the Kotelyanski lemma for nonlinear systems and defines large classes of systems for which 

the linear conjecture can be verified, either for the initial system or for its comparison 

system. 

The comparison system associated to the previous vectorial norm p(z), is defined, in this 

case, by the following differential equations: 

z(t) = M(A(.))z(t) (15) 

such that the elements mJ.) of MIA(.)J are deduced from the ones of the matrix A(.) by 
substituting the off-diagonal elements by their absolute values, which can be written as: 

j'Â«â0 = Â«,-,-(â¢) Vi = i,...,n 

{*#(â¢) =|ty.)-to,o| vf,j =!,...,Â«, i*j (16) 

The system (7) is then stabilized by (8) if the matrix MIAQ) is the opposite of an M- 
matrix, or equivalently, by application of the practical Borne-Gentina criterion: 



ffl H (.)<0 VÂ» = l,2,...,n-1 

{(-l)"det(M(A(.)))>0 

The development of the first member of the last inequality of (17): 



(17) 



K-l, 



(-i)"det(M(A(.))) = (-i)^ââ(.)-|(|3 ni (.)3 I>I (.)|)aÂ« 1 (.)J(-i) n " 1 nSjyC) (18) 

achieves easily the proof of theorem 1. 

Corollary 1. The system described by (7) and (8) and verifying (10) such that: 

i. the nonlinear elements are located in either one row or one column of the matrix A(.) , 

ii. the diagonal elements Ifl^Q-bjQfcjQ), Vz =l,...,rt â 1, of the matrix A(.) are strictly 

negative, 
Hi. the products of the off-diagonal elements of the matrix A(.) are such that: 

(aM-b n (M-))(^in(-)-U)K(-))^0\fi = i,...,n-l (19) 



Coexistence of Synchronization and Anti-Synchronization 

for Chaotic Systems via Feedback Control 207 

is asymptotically stable if there exist e > for which the instantaneous characteristic polynomial 
Pj n (.,/l) of A(.) satisfies the condition: 

P A(.)(-'Â°) = H)" det ( M ( A 0))^ ( 2 Â°) 

Proof. The proof of corollary 1 is inferred of theorem 1 by taking into account the new 
added iii. conditions, which guarantee, through a simple transformation, the identity of the 
matrix A(.) and its overvaluing matrix MIAQ). 

These conditions, associated to aggregation techniques based on the use of vector norms, 
have led to stability domains for a class of Lur'e Postnikov systems whereas, for example, 
Popov stability criterion use failed (Benrejeb, 1980). 

3.2 Nonlinear multivariable systems case 

In the case of nonlinear multivariable systems, let us consider the closed-loop error system 
described by: 

e(t) = A(.)e(t) + B(.)u(t) (21) 

u(t) = -K(.)e(t) (22) 

then by: 

e(t) = A(.)e(t) (23) 

A(.) = A(.)-B(.)K(.) (24) 

with ueR the control vector, A(.) the nxn instantaneous characteristic matrix, 
A(.) = \a l ;,(â )(, B(.) the nxh control matrix, B(.) = |fe,;(.)> and K(.) the hxn instantaneous 
gain matrix, K(.) = \k i A.)\. 
The conditions allowing to put A(.) under arrow form, are expressed as follows: 

a il (.)-T d b il (.)k lj (.) = 0\/i,j = i,...,n-i, i*j (25) 

Then, a necessary condition leading to the existence of a control law is that the number of 
equations to solve, (n-l)(n-2), must be less than or equal to the number of unknown 
parameters, n x h, then: 

h>n-2 (26) 

Remark 1. If there exist i, i<n, such that &,;(.)/ VZ = l,...,h, is equal to zero and by 
considering the conditions (25) allowing to put the matrix A(.) under the arrow form, the 
system (21) must be such that: 

Â«..(,) = o V; = \,...,n-\ for i *â  j (27) 



208 



Chaotic Systems 



Remark 2. If all the elements &,;(.), Vz =l,...,n -1, \/l = l,...,h, are equal to zero, then the 
equations (25) cannot be satisfied only in the particular case where the matrix A(.) is under 
the arrow form; that is to say, that all the elements 3Â«(.), Vz',;' = l,...,Â« -1, for I*/, are equal 
to zero, due to: 



Zbâ(.)k lj (.) = o\/i,j = i,...,n-i,i*i 



(28) 



Theorem 2. The system described by (21) and (22) and verifying (25) and (26), is stabilized by the 
control law (22) if the instantaneous characteristic matrix A{), defined by (24), is such that: 
i. the nonlinear elements are located in either one row or one column of the matrix A(.), 
ii. the first (n â u diagonal elements of the matrix A(.) are such that: 



W-)-ZMM<ow=u..,Â»-i 



(29) 



Hi. there exist s > o, such that: 



sââ(.)-Â£m.)^o]-"i 

1=1 J i=l 



1=1 A i=i 



y\U)-ih(.)k u (.) 



-i 



<-Â£ 



(30) 



Proof. The proof of theorem 2 is similar to the theorem 1 relatively to the dynamic nonlinear 

monovariable continuous system; the conditions (29) and (30) are inferred from the 

conditions (11) and (12), by replacing the elements 5, â â¢(.) by their expressions according to 

the elements of A(.), B(.) and K(.) matrices. 

Remark 3. The previous results, well adapted for multivariable systems, can be applied only 

for monovariable ones which are, at most, of third order, by respect to the above-mentioned 

necessary condition (26). 

Although, according to the class of systems described by differential scalar equation, the 

arrow form matrix can be advantageously used in a different way. 

In such a view, let us consider the closed-loop nonlinear system assumed to be described by 

the following differential scalar equation: 



{n) (t) + "Â£a l (s(t), s'(t), ..., s("- 1 )(0)sÂ«(f) = 



(31) 



s is the output, s e R, y the state vector y = \s s' ... s*"~ ' , yel", and 
Â«,(.), Vz' = 0,l,...,rt â 1, coefficients of the instantaneous characteristic polynomial P A ,J.,A) 
of the matrix A(.), such that: 



P AQ (.,X) = det(AI - A(.)) = X n + I a t (.)X l 



(32) 



The system (31) can be rewritten as:

with a,, Vz' = l,2,...,n â 1, distinct arbitrary constant parameters, a^a^, Vi^j, leads to the 
following description: 



x{t) = A{)x{t) 



(37) 



where the new instantaneous characteristic matrix, denoted by A(.) is in the Benrejeb arrow 
form: 



A(.) = p^AQP

(42) 



For the system described by (37) and (39), the application of Borne-Gentina criterion can 
lead to the stability conditions of the studied nonlinear system as shown in the following. 



210 



Chaotic Systems 



The equilibrium state of the nonlinear system (37) is asymptotically stable if the conditions: 
i. a, < o, i = \,...,n-\, a, * a , Vj * j (43) 

ii. there exist a positive parameter s, such that: 



râ(-)-'L\i3 i ri(-)\cc; 1 <- Â£

(44) 



are satisfied. 

When the (w-l) products yffjftQ, Vi = l,...,/t â 1, are non-negative, the condition (44) can be 
reduced and stated, by means of the instantaneous characteristic polynomial of the matrix 
A(.), in the following manner: 

P AQ (,0)>s (45) 

which constitutes a verification case of the validity of the linear Aizerman conjecture. 

4. Synchronization and anti-synchronization cases 

4.1 Synchronization of two identical coupled chaotic Chen systems 

In this part, let focus on the problem of synchronization process of two identical coupled 

chaotic Chen dynamical systems. 

The studied system is described by the following differential equations (Fallahi et al., 2008): 



(46) 



*l(t) 




-a a 





Xl (t) 







x 2 (t) 


= 


y -a y 





x 2 (t) 


+ 


- Xl (t)x 3 (t) 


*3Â«_ 







-A 


_* 3 (t)_ 




_ X l(0 X 2(0 



where a, j5 and y are three positive parameters. 

The system (46) exhibits a chaotic attractor at the parameter values: a = 35, /? = 3 and / = 28, 

starting at the initial value of the state vector x(o) = [l 1 0.5] , Fig. 2. 

Obviously, the Chen nonlinear model can also be presented by respect to the following 

model: 



m=A(.) X (t) 



(47) 



where x(t) = [x 1 (t) x 2 (t) x 3 (t)] is the state vector and A(.) the instantaneous 
characteristic matrix such that: 



A(.) = 



-a a o 

y-a y -x^t) 
o x x (t) -p 



(48) 



At this stage, we choose a master Chen system given by: 



Coexistence of Synchronization and Anti-Synchronization 
for Chaotic Systems via Feedback Control 



211 



xâ,i(t) = a(x m2 (t)-x ml (t)) 
â¢ x m2 (t) = {/- a-x m3 (t))x ml (t) + yx m2 (t) 

X m 3(t) = X ml (t)x m2 (t)-Px m3 (t) 



which drives a slave Chen system described by: 



* sl (t) = a(x s2 (t)-x sl (t)) 



(t) = ( r -a- x s3 (t))x sl (t) + yx s2 (t) + Ul (t) 



- v s2 

x s3 (t) = x sl (t)x s2 (t)-j3x s3 (t) + u 2 (t) 

Uj(t), i = 1,2, are the appropriate control functions to be determined. 
It comes the error dynamics equations below: 

e sl (t) = a(e S2 (t)-e sl (t)) 

â¢ e S2 (t) = (/- a)e sl {t) + ye S2 {t) + (x ml (t)x m3 (t) -x sl (t)x s3 (t)) + w x (f) 
^ S3 (t) = -^ S3 (t)-(x ml (t)x m2 (t)-x sl (t)x s2 (t)) + u 2 (t) 

which can be rewritten in the form:

The synchronization problem for coupled Chen chaotic dynamical systems is to achieve the 
asymptotic stability of this error system (52), with the following active control functions 
Uj(t), i =1,2, defined by: 



Â«,(*) = -! *#(â¢)*/(*)-/((â¢) vÂ» = 1,2 

1=1 

Then, for an instantaneous 2x2 gain matrix K(.), K(.) = \k i ,(â¢)(/ we obtain: 



(54) 



e S l(0 = Â«( e S2(0- e Sl(0) 

*s2(0 = (r-a-feii(-))Â«si(0+(r-fei2O)Â«s2(0 + (*mi(*)*Â«3(0-*Â«iW*.3(0)-/iQ ( 55 ) 

*S3(0 = -fcaOÂ«Sl(0-fc22(-)Â«S2(0-^S3(*)-(*ml(*)Â«Â»2(0-*.l(t)Â«.2(0)-/2(0 

The characterization of the closed-loop system by an arrow form matrix is easily checked, by 
choosing the correction parameter k 22 (.) such that: 

k 22 = o (56) 

Then, to satisfy the constraints (29) as well as the condition (30) of the theorem 2, the two 
following inequalities must be, respectively, fulfilled: 



r-k 12 (.)<o 

-a-{ja(r-a-k n (.))\( r -k 12 (.)y 1] j<0 



So, V k 21 {), possible choices of the other parameters are given by: 

{k 12 = a 
k u =/-a 



(57) 
(58) 

(59) 



Finally, it remains to study the stability of a linear controlled system, in the case where the 
following possible choices are adopted: 



{fi(-) = x ml (t)x m3 (t)-x sl {t)x s3 (t) 

\f2(-) = -X m l(t)X m2 (t) + X sl (t)x s2 (t) 
Then, the constant gain matrix K, can be chosen as: 



K: 



y -a a

Thus, when stabilized by the above-mentioned feedback w,(f), i =1,2, the error system (55) 
will converge to zero as f^ +co implying that system (50) will globally synchronize with 
system (49). 

Fig. 3. shows the error dynamics in the uncontrolled state, while both Fig. 4. and Fig. 5. 
illustrate the error dynamics when controller is switched on. Obviously, the two chaotic 
Chen systems evolve in the same direction as well as the same amplitude; they are globally 
asymptotically synchronized by means of the proposed controller.

e AS2( t ) = x $2(t) + X m2 (t) 

^AS3( t ) = X s 3(t) + X m3 (t) 

the error system can be defined by the following differential equations: 

e A si(t) = -We AS1 (t) + l0e AS2 (t)

The problem of chaos anti-synchronization between two identical Lee chaotic dynamical 
systems is solved here by the design of a state feedback structure fc,(.), Vj =1,2,3, and the 
choice of nonlinear functions /,(â¢), Vf = 1,2,3, such that: 



Â«(t) = -Z M-K(0 -//(â ) V; = 1,2,3

system asymptotically stable.

the overvaluing matrix is in arrow form and has non negative off-diagonal elements and 
nonlinearities isolated in either one row or one column. 

By the use of the proposed theorem 2, stability and anti-synchronization properties are 
satisfied for the both following sufficient conditions (72) and (73): 

-k 2 (.)<0 (72) 

-10 -(-10(40 -JfcjOjjK^OJl-eO (73) 

Various choices of the gain vector -K(.), K(.) = [fc 1 (.) k 2 (.) 0], are possible, such as the 
following linear one: 

K = {*,â } = [4 2 0] (74) 

T 
By considering the initial condition e AS (0) = T2 3 2 , for the Lee error system (66) 

when the active controller is deactivated, it is obvious that the error states grow with time 

chaotically, as shown in Fig. 7., and after activating the controller, Fig. 8. shows three 

parametrically harmonically excited 3D systems evolve in the opposite direction. The 

trajectories of error system (68) imply that the asymptotical anti-synchronization has been, 

successfully, achieved, Fig. 9. 

5. Hybrid synchronization by a nonlinear state feedback controller - 
Application to the Chen-Lee chaotic system (Hammami, 2009) 

Let consider two coupled chaotic Chen and Lee systems (Juhn et al., 2009). The following 
nonlinear differential equations, of the form (1), correspond to a master system (Tarn & Si 
Tou, 2008): 

x m (t) = A(x m (t))x m {t)

x ml' x m2 an ^ x m3 are state variables, and a, b, c and d four system parameters. 

For the following parameters (a,b,C,d) = (5,â 10,0.3,â 3.8), and initial condition 

[x ml (0) x m2 (0) X m3 (0)] =[l.5 -32 13] , the drive system, described by (1) and (75) 
is a chaotic attractor, as shown in Fig. 10.

(77) 



we have selected the anti-synchronization state variables x ml and x m3 facing to X s -y and 

X s3 , and the synchronization state variable x m2 facing to X s2 - 

Then, the hybrid synchronization errors between the master and the slave systems

e s 2 (0 =x s2 {t)-x m2 {t) 

[eAS3(t)=x S 3(t) + x m3 {t) 



(78) 



Let compute the following continuous state feedback controller's structure: 

u(t) = -K(x m (t),x s (t))e(t) (79) 

to guarantee the asymptotic stability of the error states defined by (78), 

e = \_ e ASl e S2 e AS3] ' so th^ * ne slave system, characterized by (76) and (77), 
synchronizes and anti-synchronizes, simultaneously, to the master one, described by (1) and 
(75), by assuring that the synchronization error e S2 ar >d the anti-synchronization errors 
e ASl ar, d e AS3 decay to zero, within a finite time. 
Thus, for a state feedback controller of the form (79), K(.), K(.) = ikJ.)), Vz, j = 1,2,3, and 

by considering the differential systems (1), (75), (76), (77) and (78), we obtain the following 
state space description of the error resulting system: 



with: 



A(.) =

(80) 



(81) 



By respect to the stabilisability conditions announced in the above-mentioned theorem 2, the 
dynamic error system (80) is first characterized by an instantaneous arrow form matrix 
A(.), that is to say, the main requirements concerning the choice of the feedback gains 
A42Q and fc 2 i(.) are given by: 



M-) = 



3 (f) 



(82) 



To satisfy that the two first diagonal elements of the characteristic matrix A(.) are strictly 
negative: 



a-k n (.) <o 
b-k 22 (.) <o 



a possible solution is: 



--7 
--6 



(83) 



(84) 



Besides, to annihilate the nonlinearities in system (80), a solution is:

the studied dynamic error system (80) is asymptotically stable. 

T 
For the following initial master and slave systems conditions, x,â(0) = [l.5 â52 13] , 

T 

x s (0) = râ 2 10 â 15 1 , and without activation of the designed controller, the numerical 

simulation results of the above master-slave system are shown in Fig. 11. 

It is obvious, from Fig. 12., that the error states grow with time chaotically. 

Therefore, by designing an adequate nonlinear controlled slave system and under mild 

conditions, the hybrid synchronization is achieved within a shorter time, as it is shown in 

Fig. 13., with an exponentially decaying error, Fig. 14. 

The obtained phase trajectories of the Fig. 15., show that the Chen-Lee slave chaotic 

attractor is synchronized in a hybrid manner with the master one.

6. Conclusion 

Appropriate feedback controllers are designed, in this chapter, for the chosen slave system 
states to be synchronized, anti-synchronized as well as synchronized in a hybrid manner 
with the target master system states. It is shown that by applying a proposed control 
scheme, the variance of both synchronization and anti-synchronization errors can converge 
to zero. The synchronisation of two identical Chen chaotic systems, the anti-synchronization 
of two identical Lee chaotic systems and, finally, the coexistence of both synchronization 
and anti-synchronization for two identical Chen-Lee chaotic systems, considered as a 
coupled master-slave systems, are guaranteed by using the practical stability criterion of 
Borne and Gentina, associated to the specific matrix description, namely the arrow form 
matrix.

1. Introduction 

Chaos systems can be classified as one type of complex dynamical systems that possess special 
features such as being extremely sensitive to tiny variations of initial conditions. In general, 
for deterministic chaos to exists, a dynamical system must have a dense set of periodic orbits, 
it must be transitive and it has to be sensitive to initial conditions (Strogatz, 2001). Chaos 
systems have bounded trajectories in the phase space, and they have at least one positive 
maximum Lyapunov exponent (Dieci, 2002; Lu et al., 2005; Munoz-Pacheco & Tlelo-Cuautle, 
2010; Ramasubramanian & Sriram, 2000). 

Nowadays, several chaos generators have been implemented with electronic devices and 
circuits in order to have a major impact on many novel applications, as the ones reported in 
(Cruz-Hernandez et al., 2005; Ergun & Ozoguz, 2010; Gamez-Guzman et al., 2008; Lin & Wang, 
2010; Strogatz, 2001; Trejo-Guerra et al., 2009). Furthermore, this chapter is mainly devoted 
to highlight the design automation of continuous-time multi-scroll chaos generators, their 
implementations by using behavioral models of commercially available electronic devices, 
their experimental realizations and applications to secure communications. A review of 
the double-scroll Chua's circuit is also presented along with the generation of hyperchaos 
by Coupling Two Chua's circuits. Basically, we present the generation of multi-scroll 
attractors by using saturated nonlinear function series. We show their implementation 
by using traditional operational amplifiers (opamps) and current-feedback operational 
amplifiers (CFOAs) (Senani & Gupta, 1998). Besides, we summarize some performances 
of multi-scroll chaos generators by using opamps (Munoz-Pacheco & Tlelo-Cuautle, 2010), 
CFOAs (Trejo-Guerra, Sanchez-Lopez, Tlelo-Cuautle, Cruz-Hernandez & Munoz-Pacheco, 
2010), current conveyors (CCs) (Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2010) and unity-gain cells (UGCs) 
(Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2008). However, not only the CC and the UGC can be taken from 
the commercially available CFOA AD844, but also they can be designed with standar 
integrated complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology (Trejo-Guerra, 
Tlelo-Cuautle, Munoz-Pacheco, Cruz-Hernandez & Sanchez-Lopez, 2010). 



228 Chaotic Systems 

The usefulness of the chaos generators is highlighted through the physical realization of 
a secure communication system by applying Hamiltonian forms and observer approach 
(Cruz-Hernandez et al., 2005). This chapter finishes by listing several trends on the 
implementation of chaos generators by using integrated CMOS technology, which may open 
new lines for research covering the behavioral modeling, synthesis, design and simulation of 
integrated chaotic oscillators. 

1.1 Description of a chaos system 

In order to make any quantitative progress in understanding a system, a mathematical model 
is required. The model may be formulated in many ways, but their essential feature allows 
us to predict the behavior of the system, sometimes by given its initial conditions and a 
knowledge of the external forces which affect it. In electronics, the mathematical description 
for a dynamical system, most naturally adopted for behavioral modeling, is done by using the 
so-called state-space representation, which basically consists of a set of differential equations 
describing the evolution of the variables whose values at any given instant determine the 
current state of the system. These are known as the state variables and their values at any 
particular time are supposed to contain sufficient information for the future evolution of the 
system to be predicted, given that the external influences (or input variables) which act upon 
it are known. 

In the state-space approach, the differential equations are of first order in the time-derivative, 
so that the initial values of the variables will suffice to determine the solution. In general, the 
state-space description is given in the form: 

x = f(x,u,t) 

y = h(x,u,t) W 

where the dot denotes differentiation with respect to time (Â£) and the functions f and h are 
in general nonlinear. In (1), the variety of possible nonlinearities is infinite, but it may 
nevertheless be worthwhile to classify them into some general categories. For example: 
There are simple analytic functions such as powers, sinusoids and exponentials of a single 
variable, or products of different variables. A significant feature of these functions is that they 
are smooth enough to possess convergent Taylor expansions at all points and consequently 
can be linearized (Strogatz, 2001). A type of nonlinear function frequently used in system 
modeling is the piecewise-linear (PWL) approximation, which consists of a set of linear 
relations valid in different regions (Elhadj & Sprott, 2010; Lin & Wang, 2010; Lii et al., 
2004; Munoz-Pacheco & Tlelo-Cuautle, 2009; Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2010; Suykens et al., 1997; 
Trejo-Guerra, Sanchez-Lopez, Tlelo-Cuautle, Cruz-Hernandez & Munoz-Pacheco, 2010; Yalcin 
et al., 2002). The use of PWL approximations have the advantage that the dynamical equations 
become linear or linearized in any particular region, and hence the solutions for different 
regions can be joined together at the boundaries. 

When applying PWL approximation to a system described by (1), the resulting linearized 
system has finite dimensional state-space representation, as a result the equations describing 
a linear behavioral model become: 

x = Ax + Bu . 

y = Cx + Du ( ' 

where A, B, C, and D are matrices (possibly time-dependent) of appropriate dimensions. The 
great advantage of linearity is that, even in the time dependent case, a formal solution can 



Design and Applications of Continuous-Time Chaos Generators 229 

immediately be constructed, which is moreover applicable for all initial conditions and all 
input functions. 

An important point which must be kept in mind for a nonlinear dynamical system, is that the 
stability properties are essentially more complicated than in the linear case. For instance, when 
nonlinearities are present, several features can appear such as limit cycles or the phenomenon 
known as chaos (Chakraborty & Dana, 2010; Chua, 1975; Cook, 1994; Munoz-Pacheco & 
Tlelo-Cuautle, 2010; Ott, 1994; Strogatz, 2001). 

1 .2 Autonomous systems 

Although the equations describing a behavioral dynamical model will in general depend on 
the time, either explicitly or through the input function, or both, a large part of nonlinear 
system theory is concerned with cases where there is no time dependence at all (Ott, 1994). 
Such systems are said to be autonomous, and they arise quite naturally in practice when, for 
example, the input vector is held fixed. In any such case, the differential equation for the state 
vector become: 

x = f(x,u) (3) 

where u is a constant vector. Thus, the equilibrium points in the state-space are determined 
by f (x, u) = . Assuming that f (x, u) satisfies Lipschitz condition (Chua, 1975), the differential 
equation for x(t) will have a unique solution, for any given initial state x(0) . The path traced 
out in the state-space by x(t) is called a trajectory of the system and because of the uniqueness 
property, there will be one and only one trajectory passing through any given point. If it is 
suppressed the dependence on u, the state-space differential equations for an autonomous 
system can be written simply as: 

x = f (x) (4) 

and the set of all trajectories of this equation provides a complete geometrical representation of 
the dynamical behavior of the system, under the specified conditions. As a result, it is possible 
to give an essentially complete classification of behavior in the phase plane, though not in 
higher-dimensional state-spaces. In general, the equations describing a nonlinear system 
cannot be solved analytically, so that, in order to construct the trajectories accurately, it is 
necessary to use numerical methods. 

1 .3 Strange attractors and chaos 

Although singular points and closed curves constitute the only asymptotic terms of bounded 
trajectories for autonomous systems in the phase plane, this is no longer true in spaces of 
higher dimension (Cook, 1994). In general, the term for a limit set where all trajectories in its 
vicinity approach it as t â Â» oo ; is an attractor, since it asymptotically attracts nearby trajectories 
to itself. For second-order dynamical systems, the only types of limit set normally encountered 
are singular points and limit cycles. Consequently, a continuous-time autonomous system 
requires more than two dimensions to exhibit chaos (Cook, 1994; Ott, 1994; Strogatz, 2001). 
More complicated still are the so-called strange limit sets (Strogatz, 2001). They may or may 
not be asymptotically attractive to neighboring trajectories; if so, they are known as strange 
attractors, though even then, the trajectories they contain may be locally divergent from each 
other, within the attracting set. Such structures are associated with the quasi-random behavior 
of solutions called chaos (Cook, 1994).

2. Chua's circuit and Hyperchaos 

Over the last two decades, theoretical design and circuit implementation of various chaos 
generators have been a focal subject of increasing interest due to their promising applications 
in various real-world chaos-based technologies and information systems (Cook, 1994; 
Cruz-Hernandez et al., 2005; Ergun & Ozoguz, 2010; Gamez-Guzman et al., 2008; Lin & Wang, 
2010; Ott, 1994; Strogatz, 2001; Trejo-Guerra et al., 2009). 

In electronics, among the currently available chaotic oscillators, Chua's circuit has been the 
most used one (Chakraborty & Dana, 2010; Elhadj & Sprott, 2010; Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2008; 
Senani & Gupta, 1998; Suykens et al., 1997; Trejo-Guerra et al., 2009), because it can be easily 
built, simulated, and tractable mathematically. It consists of five circuit elements: one linear 
resistor, one inductor, two capacitors, and one nonlinear resistor known as Chua's diode 
(Tlelo-Cuautle et al., 2006).

Fig. 1. (a) Chua's circuit, (b) Chua's diode and (c) Simulated inductance using CCII+s. 

From the design point of view, there are many ways to realize the inductor and Chua's diode 
by using electronic devices, e.g. by using current-feedback operational amplifiers (CFOAs) 
(Senani & Gupta, 1998), positive-type second generation current conveyors (CCII+), and 
unity-gain cells (UGCs) (Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2008). All these realizations can be made by 
using the commercially available CFOA AD844 from analog devices. In this subsection we 
show the realization using CCII+s, which is embedded into the CFOA AD844. It is worthy to 
mention that current conveyors present nonideal characteristics (Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2010), 
and since its introduction in 1970 (Sedra & Smith, 1970), recently there exists other topologies 
(Tlelo-Cuautle & C. Sanchez-Lopez, 2010). Among them, the CCII+ is a very useful building 
block (Trejo-Guerra et al, 2009). 

In Chua's circuit the inductor can be implemented from the gyrator description 
(Sanchez-Sinencio & Silva-Martinez, 2000), and it can be designed using CCII+s. Chua's diode 
can also be implemented by using CCII+s as shown in Fig. 1, each CCII+ in Fig. 1(b) is biased 
with different voltage bias levels: CCII+1 is biased with +5V and CCII+2 with +12V. The 
values of the resistors are: R 1= 6.76A:n, R 2 =3.91kn, R 3 =470O., and R 4 =10Jtn. The CCII+ based 
simulated inductance is shown in Fig. 1(c), where for C=4.7nF, then Rn=Ri2=2.36kCi. 
By setting Cj=4.7nF and C2=47nF in Chua's circuit, and by replacing Chua's diode and the 
inductor with the proposed circuits shown in Fig. 1(b) and Fig. 1(c), respectively, the sequence

R=277in the double scroll is observed. Finally, the limit cycle is appreciated when R=2712d. 



2.1 Hyperchaos 

Hyperchaos can be generated by coupling two Chua's circuits as shown in Fig. 3. The Chua's 
circuit in the top of Fig. 3 is composed of RM, C1M, C2M, Chua's diode is implemented 
with the CCII+s 1DM and 2DM (including RIM to R4M), and the simulated inductance is 
implemented by C3M and two transconductors realized with two CCII+s (R5M connected 
between the CCII+s 3LM and 4LM, and R6M connected between the CCII+s 5LM and 6LM).

Fig. 3. Coupling two CCII+ based Chua's circuits 

The second Chua's circuit (bottom of Fig. 3), is composed of RS, CIS, C2S, Chua's diode 
is implemented with the CCII+s IDS and 2DS (including R1S to R4S), and the simulated 
inductance is implemented by C3S and two transconductors realized with two CCII+s (R5S 
connected between the CCII+s 3LS and 4LS, and R6S connected between the CCII+s 5LS and 
6LS). Finally, the coupling is performed through R7 connected between two CCII+s (2C1 and 
2C2). As one sees, RM=3032fi in the first Chua's circuit has a different value compared to 
RS=3116fi in the second Chua's circuit, the rest of the elements in both Chua's circuits have 
the same value. This difference is attributed to the coupling circuit, in which R7 establishes 
the gain and it can be varied. 

The hyperchaotic behaviors can be appreciated by varying the gain, i.e. R7. In Fig. 4 are 
shown the hyperchatic behaviors by diminishing R7 without persistence, while in Fig. 5 are 
shown the same hyperchaotic behaviors provided in Fig. 4 but with persistence. It can be 
appreciated that hyperchaos is disappearing when R7 is diminished. However, we have a 
wide range of values for R7 to tune the hyperchaotic behavior for a specific application, e.g. 
secure communications. 



3. Design automation of multi-scroll chaos generators 

The design of multi-scroll chaotic attractors can be performed via PWL functions (Elhadj & 
Sprott, 2010; Lin & Wang, 2010; Lii et al., 2004; Munoz-Pacheco & Tlelo-Cuautle, 2009; 2010;

Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2010; Suykens et al., 1997; Trejo-Guerra, Sanchez-Lopez, Tlelo-Cuautle, 
Cruz-Hernandez & Munoz-Pacheco, 2010; Trejo-Guerra, Tlelo-Cuautle, Jimenez-Fuentes & 
Sanchez-Lopez, 2010; Yalcin et al., 2002). In the case of Chua's circuit based oscillators, 
the PWL function is designed by introducing additional breakpoints to Chua's diode 
(Trejo-Guerra, Sanchez-Lopez, Tlelo-Cuautle, Cruz-Hernandez & Munoz-Pacheco, 2010), or 
by generalizing Chua's circuit as proposed in (Suykens et al., 1997; Yalcin et al., 2000). 
When implementing multi-scroll chaos generators with electronic devices, it is necessary to 
remark that it is quite difficult to generate attractors with a large number of scrolls due to 
the limitation of the real dynamic range of the physical devices. Furthermore, among the 
basic circuits used to generate multi-scroll generators, the step circuit, hysteresis circuit and 
saturated circuit are the three most used ones. To generate multidimensional multi-scroll 
attractors, such as 1-D (Yalcin et al, 2002), 2-D (Munoz-Pacheco & Tlelo-Cuautle, 2009), 3-D 
(Deng, 2007), and 4-D (Varrientos & Sanchez-Sinencio, 1998), the state equations of this family 
of systems depends on the number of nonlinear functions, for example: three nonlinear 
functions are needed to generate 3D-scrolls. 

In (Lii et al., 2004) a saturated multi-scroll chaotic system based on saturated function series, 
is introduced. That system can produce three different types of attractors, as follows: 1-D 
saturated n-scroll chaotic attractors, 2-D saturated n x m-grid scroll chaotic attractors and 3-D 
saturated n X m X /-grid scroll chaotic attractors, where n, m and / are integers and can have 
the same values. Since this multi-scroll system can be designed by using PWL functions, it is

a good chaos system suitable for the development of a systematic design automation process 
by applying behavioral modeling (Munoz-Pacheco & Tlelo-Cuautle, 2010). 



3.1 Design automation by behavioral modeling 

Behavioral modeling can be a possible solution for successful development of analog 
electronic design automation (EDA) tools, because various types of systems that can be 
represented by means of an abstract model. The abstraction levels are an indication of the 
degree of detail specified about how the function is to be implemented. Therefore, behavioral 
models try to capture as much circuit functionality as possible with far less implementation 
details than the device-level description of the circuit (Kundert, 2004). However, it is difficult 
to make a strict distinction between different abstraction levels for analog systems, in contrast 
to common practice in digital synthesis methodologies (Castro-Lopez et al., 2006). Instead, a 
division should be made between a description level and an abstraction level. A description 
level is a pair of two sets: a set of elementary elements and a set of interconnection types. The 
abstraction level of a description is the degree to which information about non-ideal effects or 
structure is neglected compared to the dominant behavior of the entire system. 
In this manner, whereas a description level indicates how the analog system is represented; an 
abstraction level deals with the relation between the model of the system and its real behavior. 
Although it can be clear to consider the functional level at a high abstraction level and the 
physical level at a low abstraction level, it is not straightforward to compare the abstraction 
levels of different description levels. Besides, an electronic system can be designed by 



Design and Applications of Continuous-Time Chaos Generators 



235 



converting the functional specification at the highest abstraction level to a physical realization 
at the lowest abstraction level via operations between description and abstraction levels. 
Four fundamental types of such operations are distinguished: refinement, simplification, 
translation and transformation. Simplification is the reverse operation of refinement. 
Model generation consists in applying multiple simplification operations to a system 
representation to obtain a model with less accuracy, but easier to interpret or to simulate. 
From this point of view, the design automation of an electronic system must indicate the kind 
and order of the operations to be applied during the design process and must include an 
appropriate modeling strategy to determine how a system is represented. In fact, the selection 
of a good modeling strategy makes easier to execute the design process. In (Munoz-Pacheco 
& Tlelo-Cuautle, 2010) it is presented the analog design automation process of chaos systems 
which are modeled from the highest level of abstraction by applying state variables approach 
and PWL approximations. 

For the design of autonomous chaos systems, their state variables approach are defined by 
(4), where the function f is nonlinear. However, the PWL approximation can be used to 
describe this nonlinear function, which consists of a set of linear relations valid in different 
regions. Such functions are not analytic at all points, since they contain discontinuities of 
value or gradient, but they have the advantage that the dynamical equations become linear 
(and hence soluble) in any particular region, and the solutions for different regions can then be 
joined together at the boundaries. Furthermore, (4) can be described by the linear state-space 
representation given in (2). The great advantage of linearity is that, even in the time dependent 
case, a formal solution can immediately be constructed, which is moreover applicable for 
all initial conditions and all input functions. A repertoire of the design automation of 1-D, 
2-D and 3-D multi-scroll chaos generators by behavioral modeling and realized by using 
traditional operational amplifiers (opamps), is presented in Munoz-Pacheco & Tlelo-Cuautle 
(2010). The chaos generators are based on saturated nonlinear function (SNLF) series, and 
realized with opamps working in the saturation regions, so that they can be modeled by PWL 
functions. 

In Fig. 6 is shown a SNLF with 5 and 7 segments to generate 3 and 4 multi-scrolls, respectively. 
In (5) is described the PWL approximation called series of a SNLF, where k > 2 is the slope 
of the SNLF and multiplier factor to saturated plateaus, plateau = Â±nk, with n=integer 
odd to even-scrolls and n=integer even to odd-scrolls. /2=saturated delay of the center of

1, 3, ... , (scrolls â 2) to odd-scrolls; p and q are positive integers.

To generate multi-scrolls attractors a controller is added as shown in (6), where f(x;k,h,p,q) is 
defined by (7), and a, b, c, d are positive constants and must be < a, b, c, d < 1 to accomplish 
chaos conditions (Lii et al., 2004).

The simulation of multi-scrolls attractors modeled by (6) and (7), is executed using 
(Tlelo-Cuautle & Munoz-Pacheco, 2007). 6-scrolls attractors are generated with a=b=c=d=0.7, 
k=10, h=20, p=q=2, as shown in Fig. 7. As one sees, Fig. 7a shows that the dynamic ranges 
(DRs) are very large. Since real electronic devices cannot handle these DRs, (7) cannot be 
synthesized and it cannot have small DRs because k > 2 (Lii et al., 2004). Consequently, 
h = 2k or h = k for even or odd scrolls, respectively, to avoid superimposing of the slopes 
because the plateaus can disappear. This process has been automated in (Munoz-Pacheco & 
Tlelo-Cuautle, 2010; Sanchez-Lopez et al., 2010) 

Henceforth, a is restricted to 1, so that to implement multi-scrolls attractors using practical 
opamps one needs to scale the DRs from the SNLF (Lii et al, 2004). Then, the SNLF series is 
redefined by (8), where a allows that k < 1 because the chaos-condition now applies on the 
new slope s = |. In this manner, k and tx can be selected to permit k < 1, so that the DRs in 
(7) can be scaled. As a result, 6-scrolls attractors are generated with a = b = c = d = 0.7, k = 
1, a = 6.4e~ 3 , s = 156.25, h = 2, p = q = 2, as shown in Fig. 7b. Now, the DRs of the attractors 
are within the DRs of the real behavior of the opamps. Besides, it is possible to have small 
DRs depending on the values of k and a.

3.2 Circuit realization 

The dynamical system in (6) has the block diagram representation shown in Fig. 8, which is 
realized with 3 integrators and an adder. Each block can be realized with different kinds of 
active devices, namely: Op Amps, CFOAs, current conveyors (CC), unity-gain-cells (UGCs), 
and so on. The realization of the dynamical system in (6) using opamps is shown in Fig. 9 and 
by using CFOAs in Fig. 10. 

By applying Kirchhoff's current-law in Fig. 10 one obtains (9), where SNLF = i(x)Rj x . The 
parameters are determined by (10).

For instance, the cell in Fig. 13 can realize the SNLF from (8), and the number of basic cells 
(BC) is determined by BC=(number of scrolls)-l, which are parallel-connected as shown in 
Fig. 14 (Munoz-Pacheco & Tlelo-Cuautle, 2008).

4. Realization of chaotic oscillators using current-feedback operational amplifiers 

This section shows the simulation results for the SNLF based multi-scroll chaos generates 
using CFOAs. Basically, from the results provided in the previos section, we can realize the 
circuit using CFOAs, instead of opamps. In this manner, by selecting funtional specifications: 
N=5-scrolls, F=10Khz and EL = Â±5V, if V s Â«f = Â±6.4V (typical value for the coomercially 
available CFOA AD844 with Vdd = Â±10V), the circuit simulation results for generating 5 and 
6-scrolls attractors are shown in Fig. 17 and Fig. 18. WhereEi = Â±IV,E 2 = Â±?>V ,h x = l,h 2 = 
3 to generate 5-scrolls; and E\ = Â±2V,E 2 = Â±41/, hi = 2,h 2 = 4 to generate 6-scrolls; and

As one sees, the simulation results using CFOAs are quite similar to that using opamps. 
However, the electrical characteristics of the CFOA enhance the performance of the chaos 
generator, compared to opamp based circuit realizations. This advantage of the CFOA 
compared to the opamp is shown in the following section for the implementation of a secure 
communication system using multi-scroll chaos generators.

5. Synchronization of multi-scroll attractors 

This section presents the synchronization using Hamiltonian forms and an observer approach 
(Sira-Ramirez & Cruz-Hernandez, 2001). Let's consider the dynamical system described by 
the master circuit in (13). An slave system is a copy of the master and can be described by 
(14). 

x = F(x) V.t G R" (13) 

t = F(g) Vx G R" (14) 

Definition: Two chaotic systems described by a set of states X\, X2 â  â  â  x n (13) and Â£j, Â£ 2 . . . Â£n 
(14) will synchronize if the following limit fulfills (Shuh-Chuan et al., 2005; Sira-Ramirez & 
Cruz-Hernandez, 2001): 

Jim I x(t) - Â£ (t) |= (15) 

For any initial conditions i"(0) 7^ f (0). Due to the real limitations of electronic devices, a 
tolerance value is used in practical applications, where there are some other agents like noise, 
distortion, component mismatching, etc. 

\ x(t) - Â£(t) \< et Vt>t f . (16) 

Where e is the allowed tolerance value and a time t c < 00 is assumed. Equations (15) and (16) 
assume the synchronization error defined as 

e(t) = x(t) - f(t) (17) 

5.1 Hamiltonian Synchronization Approach 

To satisfy the condition in (15) and (17) between two systems, it is necessary to establish a 
physical coupling between them through which energy flows. If the energy flows in one 
direction between the systems, it is one-way coupling, known as master-slave configuration. 
This section is based on the work of (Sira-Ramirez & Cruz-Hernandez, 2001). To synchronize 
two systems by applying Hamiltonian approach, their equations must be placed in the 
Generalized Hamiltonian Canonical form. Most of the well knew systems can fulfill this 
requirement, thus, the reconstruction of the state vector from a defined output signal will 
be possible attending to the observability or detectability of a pair of constant matrices. 
Consider a class of Hamiltonian Forms with destabilizing vector field F(y) and lineal output 
y(t) of the form (18). 

i = /(y)^ + (I + S)^+F(y), V,tgK"; y = C^, Vy G 5R" (18) 

Where I denotes a constant antisymmetric matrix; S denotes a symmetric matrix; the vector 
y(t) is the system output and C is a constant matrix. The described system has an observer if 
one first considers Â£(t) as the vector of the estimated states x(t),when H(Â£) is the observer's 
energy function. In addition n(t) is the estimated output calculated from Â£(i) and the gradient 

vector 3Â£ is equal to MÂ£ with M being a symmetric constant matrix positive definited. 
Then, for (18) a nonlinear observer with gain K is (19). 



Design and Applications of Continuous-Time Chaos Generators 243 



e = ;(y)^ + (I + S)^ + F(y)+2C(y- 7 ) / n = c|J (19) 

Where the state estimation error is naturally e(t) = x(t) â Â£(Â£) and the system estimated error 
output is e-y = y(t) â rj(t), both described by the dynamical system (20). 

e = j(y)^ + (l + S-KC) d Jl, eeVt"; e y = C^' ^Â»"' (20) 

The following assumption has been made with some abuse of notation ^ c ' = 4j â ~jjr = 
M(x â Â£) = Me. Also, the equivalence / + S = W will be assumed. To maintain stability 
and to guarantee the synchronization error convergence to zero, two theorems are taken into 
account. 

Theorem 1. (Sim-Ramirez & Cruz-Hernandez, 2001). The state x(t) of the system in the form (18) 
can be globally, asymptotically and exponentially estimated by the state Â£(( ) of an observer in the form 
(19), if the pair of matrix (C,W) or (C, S), are observable or at least detectable. 

Theorem 2. (Sira-Ramirez & Cruz-Hernandez, 2001). The state x(t) of the system in the form (18) 
can be globally, asymptotically and exponentially estimated by the state Â£(() of an observer in the form 
(19), if and only if, a constant matrix K can be found to form the matrix [W â KC] + [W â KC] T = 
[S - K] + [S - KC] T = 2[S - \ {KC + C T K T )} 
which must be negative de. nite. 

In the successive, to find an observer for a system in the Hamiltonian form (18), the system 
will be arranged in the form (19), keeping observability or at least detectability and proposing 
a matrix y(t ) such that a gain matrix K can be found to achieve the conditions of Theorem 2. 

5.2 Synchronization circuit implementation 

Our proposed schemes for the synchronization of multi-scroll chaos systems of the form (19), 

by using CFOAs and OpAmps are shown in Fig. 19 and Fig.20, respectively. The vector 

K in (19) is the observer gain and it is adjusted according to the sufficiency conditions for 

synchronization (Sira-Ramirez & Cruz-Hernandez, 2001). 

By selecting R io = lOfcn, R fo = 3.9MC1 and R ko = 22Q in Fig. 19 and Fig. 20, HSPICE 

simulation of the response of the synchronization whit OpAmps and CFOAs is shown in Fig. 

21 and Fig. 24, respectively. 

The synchronization error is shown in Fig. 22 and Fig. 25, which can be adjusted with the 

gain of the observer. The coincidence of the states is represented by a straight line with a 

unity-slope (identity function) in the phase plane of each state as shown in Fig. 23 and Fig. 26. 

6. Experimental Synchronization results using CFOAs 

The realization of Fig. 20 was done by using the commercially available CFOA AD844. 

6.1 Generation of a 5-scrolls attractor 

Figure 27 shows the experimental mesurement for the implementation of the 5-scrolls SNLF. 
By selecting R ix = \0KCl,C = l.lnf ,R = 7KCl,R x = R y = R z = WKn,R f = 10Kn,R, = 
1QKC1 in Fig. 20 and R ix = WKn,R c = 64KO,R, 2 = lKCl,R fz = lMO^Ei = Â±1V and E 2 = 
Â±3V with V sat = +7.24V and -7.28V in the BC (SNLF), the result is N=5-scrolls, F=10Khz, 
EL = Â±5V as shown in Fig. 28.

7. Chaos systems applied to secure communications 

A communication system can be realized by using chaotic signals (Cruz-Hernandez et al., 
2005; Kocarev et al., 1992). Chaos masking systems are based on using the chaotic signal, 
broadband and look like noise to mask the real information signal to be transmitted, which

7.1 Two transmission channels 

As illustrated in Fig. 34, this method is to synchronize the systems in master-slave 
configuration by a chaotic signal, X\(t), transmitted exclusively on a single channel, while 
to transmit a confidential message m(t), it is encrypted with another chaotic signal, %2(t) by 
an additive process, this signal can be send through a second transmission channel.

Message recovery is performed by a reverse process, in this case, a subtraction to the signal 
received y(t) = Xjit) + m(t), it is obvious that ywe want to subtract a chaotic signal identical 
to *2 W ror faithful recovery of the original message. It is important to note that there exists 
an error in synchrony given by e\ (I ) = X\ (t) â X\ (t) = 0, thus, m(t) = m(t). 



7.2 Experimental results 

We implemented an additive chaotic masking system using two transmission channels of the 
form (18), synchronized by Hamiltonian forms the receiver chaotic system is given by (19) , 
using the scenario of unidirectional master-slave coupling, as shown in Fig. 35. 
The message to convey is a sine wave of frequency f = lOKhz and 500mV amplitude. Figures 
36 and 37 show the experimental result of the secure transmission using chaos generators

8. Conclusion 

Chaos systems can be realized with almost every commercially available electronic device, 
and they can be designed with integrated circuit technology, for which there are many open 
problems regarding the number of scrolls to be generated, the bias levels to reduce power 
consumption, the increment in frequency response, tolerance to process and environment 
variations, and so on. Furthermore, the performances of the chaos systems will depend on 
the electrical characteristics of the devices. In this chapter we presented the design of chaos 
systems using commercially available devices such as the opamp and CFOA AD844. 
We described how to generate multi-scroll attractors and how to realize the circuitry for the 
chaotic oscillator based on SNLFs. 

The application of the designed chaos generators to a communication system was highlighted 
through experimental results using CFOAs. Open problems can also be related to the 
development of applications by using chaos systems with different number of scrolls and 
dimensions and with different kinds of chaos system topologies.

1. Introduction 

Chaotic signal applications have been considered in a variety of areas, see e.g. (Strogatz, 

2001). Signal Processing and Telecommunications are no exception specially after the seminal 

work by Pecora & Carroll (1990). Applications of chaos ranging from digital and analog 

modulation to cryptography pseudorandom sequences generation and watermarking have 

been proposed (Kennedy & Kolumban, 2000; Kennedy Setti & Rovatti, 2000; Stavroulakis, 

2005; Tsekeridou et al., 2001). Chaos has also been shown in connection to devices used in 

signal processing such as nonlinear adaptive filters and phase-locked loop networks (Endo & 

Chua, 1988; Harb & Harb, 2004; Monteiro et al., 2009; Tavazoei & Haeri, 2009). 

In particular, many recent works have described digital modulations using chaotic carriers 

(Kennedy & Kolumban, 2000; Kennedy, Setti & Rovatti, 2000; Kolumban et al, 1997; 

Kolumban, Kennedy & Chua, 1998; Lau & Tse, 2003) even though their performance proved 

below that of equivalent conventional systems under additive white gaussian noise channel 

(Kaddoum et al., 2009; Williams, 2001). 

This chapter's first aim is to compare these chaos-based modulations to their conventional 

counterparts via their discrete-time low-pass equivalent models. Special attention is devoted 

to Chaos Shift Keying (CSK), Differential CSK and some of their variants in Section 3 as that 

analysis points out reasons for the low observed performance of chaotic modulation and thus 

paves the way for result improvement. 

In fact, we show that the poor Bit Error Rate (BER) performance of many current modulations 

employing chaos is in part due to their systematic neglect of the details behind the chaos 

generation mechanisms. To overcome this we explicitly exploit chaos generating map 

information to estimate the received noise-embedded chaotic signal (Section 4) and show 

that it leads to improved BER performance. Two approaches to achieve that are considered 

and contrasted: (a) Maximum Likelihood Estimation and (b) the Modified Viterbi Algorithm 

(MVA) for discrete-time one-dimensional chaotic maps. 

In the context of MVA, we further examine two digital modulation schemes: the Modified 

Maximum Likelihood Chaos Shift Keying using (a) one and (b) two maps both of which have 

better BER characteristics than previous noncoherent chaos communication schemes (Section 

5). 

Before proceeding we start reviewing basic definitions and the discrete-time low-pass 

equivalent models. 



256 Chaotic Systems 

2. Preliminary notions 

For our present purposes we take a limited signal to be chaotic if it is deterministic, aperiodic 
and exhibits sensitive dependence on initial conditions (Alligood et al., 1997), i.e. when its 
generating system is initialized in a slightly different initial condition, the resulting signal 
very quickly diverges from that with the original unperturbed initial conditions. 
Due to these properties, chaotic signals occupy a large bandwidth, their autocorrelations are 
impulsive and the cross-correlations between signals generated by different initial conditions 
present low values (Djurovic & Rubezic, 2008; Kennedy & Kolumban, 2000; Kennedy, Setti 
& Rovatti, 2000; Stavroulakis, 2005). These characteristics have been behind the rationale for 
using chaotic signals as candidates for spreading signal information. When chaotic signals 
modulate independent narrowband sources increased bandwidths result with lower power 
spectral density levels in a fashion similar to what happens in Spread Spectrum (SS) systems 
(Lathi, 1998). Consequently, chaos-based and SS systems share several properties namely (i) 
they are difficult to intercept by any unauthorized user; (ii) they are easily hidden, i.e. from 
any unauthorized receiver, it is difficult to even detect their presence in many cases; (iii) they 
are resistant to jamming; and (iv) they provide a measure of immunity to distortion due to 
multipath propagation. 

The unified low pass representation used here is based on (Kolumban et al., 1997; Kolumban, 
Kennedy & Chua, 1998) in the discrete time context which is more suitable to treating signals 
generated by chaotic maps. 

In the following, only the transmission of isolated symbols is considered, i.e. intersymbol 
interference is assumed absent. 

2.1 Equivalent low-pass discrete-time models 

To facilitate simulation and analysis of digital modulations it is usual to work with 

discrete-time baseband equivalent models, whose results are valid for the original ones (Lathi, 

1998). This modeling allows us to represent the transmitted signals by means of finite length 

sequences. 

In the conventional case, a baseband signal, supposed to have a bandwidth B, is used to 

modify the sinusoidal carrier with frequency fg ^ B. 

As any bandpass signal can be described by (Lathi, 1998) 

x{t) = x c (t) cos(2nf t) - x s (t) sin(27r/ f), (1) 

its low-pass representation denoted by X;(Â£) turns out to be a complex function with real and 
imaginary parts x c (t) and x s (t) respectively, so that: 

Xl (t)=x c (t)+ix s (t), (2) 

where both x c (t) and x s (t) are low-pass signals termed in-phase and quadrature components 

respectively (Hay kin, 2000). 

The discrete-time version of the baseband model is obtained sampling X[(t) at a convenient 

sampling rate 1/T^ (Lathi, 1998). To simplify the notation, we denote Xi(nT a ) as x(n). 

The set of equivalent waveform sequences used in a given system using M symbols is 

represented by x m (n), m = 1, 2, . . . , M, where x m (n) j= only for < n < N â 1. To transmit 

the m-th symbol, the signal represented in discrete-time by x m (n) is sent through the analog 

channel. 



Applying Estimation Techniques to Chaos-based Digital Communications 257 

To simplify demodulation, it is convenient to define a set with fewer signals, called basis 
functions, so that the signals represented by x m (n) are weighted sums of the elements of this 
basis (Wozencraft & Jacobs, 1987). 
Let Sj(n),i = 1,2, ... ,Nj,,n = 0,1,...,Nâ 1 be an orthonormal basis sequence, i.e., 

Y^s,{n)sj{n) = [Yl i l = ] \<i,j<N b . (3) 

Â«=o ^ ' ' ' 

Thus, each of the M signals x m (n) is represented as a linear combination of the A/j, sequences 
Si(n),vnthN b < M: 

x m (n) = Y^ x mi s ii n ), m = 1,2, ...,M. (4) 

i=l 
The coefficients x mi in Eq.(4) can be interpreted as the components of an N;,-dimensional 
column vector x,â. 

Since the basis sequences are orthonormal, the x,â signal vector can be recovered from the 
transmitted signal if all basis signals s, (n) are known: 

N-l 

x m i = Y^ x m (n)si(n), i = 1, 2, . . ., N b . (5) 

n=0 

Interestingly, this notation applies to both conventional and chaotic modulations. The 
difference between them lies in the nature of the chosen basis. 

The chaotic sequences in the next section are assumed to be composed of N points derived 
from the tent map /r(.) defined by 

s(n + l) =/ T (s(n)) = l-2|s(n)|, < n < N - 1, (6) 

with initial conditions s(0) uniformly distributed over the ( â 1,1) interval. To achieve unit 
mean energy the latter sequences are then multiplied by \/3/N (Eisencraft et al., 2010). 

3. Digital modulations using chaotic carriers 

We focus on Chaos Shift Keying (CSK) and its variants based on noncoherent or differential 
demodulation because of their promise in proposed practical applications (Kennedy, 
Kolumban, Kis & Jako, 2000; Kennedy, Setti & Rovatti, 2000; Kolumban et al, 1997; Kolumban, 
Kennedy & Chua, 1998; Lau & Tse, 2003; Stavroulakis, 2005). In fact, researchers from the 
Optical Communications Laboratory of the Athens University in Greece, implemented an 
120km optical fiber link in metropolitan Athens and managed to transmit at gigabit rates 
using CSK (Argyris et al., 2005; Syvridis, 2009). 

3.1 The CSK and the DCSK 

CSK is a digital modulation where each symbol to be transmitted is encoded as the coefficients 

of a linear combination of signals generated by different chaotic attractors (Kolumban et al., 

1997). 

Using the previously defined notation, the required basis sequences must be chosen as 

segments of the chaotic signals generated by JVf, different attractors. As a result of the chaos 

related non-periodicity, the sequences s,(h) and therefore the signals x m (n) are different for 

each subsequent transmitted symbol. 



258 



Chaotic Systems 



We impose that the chaotic basis sequences are orthonormal in the mean, i.e. 



N-l 
E s i( n ) s j( n ) 

11=0 



1, if i = ;' 

0, if i Â£ j 



1 < i,j < N b/ 



(7) 



where Â£[.] denotes the expectation operator. Eq.(7) identifies an important characteristic of 
digital chaotic modulation schemes: the orthonormality of the basis signals can be defined 
only in terms of expected values. 

Using Eq. (5), the coefficients x m j can be recovered from the transmitted signal by correlation 
with locally generated copies of the basis sequences S;(n) as shown in Figure 1(a) for the case 
N b = l.

If the coefficients x,â, generate signals with different energies for each m, demodulation can 

also be done by estimating the energy of the received signal. In this case, copies of the basis 

sequences are unnecessary. A block diagram of the non-coherent demodulator for Nj, = 1 is 

shown in Figure 1(b). 

In the special case of binary CSK with one basis function, the symbols are transmitted using 

the signals *i(w) = XnSi(n) and *2( M ) = x 21 s l( M )- Three possibilities are highlighted in the 

literature: 

i. Unipodal CSK (Kennedy, Setti & Rovatti, 2000), where X\\ and X21 are positive and 
different; 

ii. Chaotic On-Off Keying (COOK) (Kolumban, Kennedy & Chua, 1998), where x u is 
positive and x%i = and 

iii. Antipodal CSK(Kennedy Setti & Rovatti, 2000), where x 2 \ = -x u ^ 0. 

Figure 2 shows examples of transmitted signals x(n) for the sequence of symbols 
{ 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0} using each type of CSK above, with N = 50 and mean energy per symbol 
Ej, = 1. The Si(w) sequence is obtained by iterating the tent map of Eq. (6). The symbols "1" 
and "0" are transmitted using Xj(w) = XjjSi (n) and *2( M ) = x 21 s l( n ) respectively.

Differential CSK (DCSK) is a variant of CSK with two maps whose basis sequences consist of 
repeated segments of chaotic waveforms. For DCSK the two basis signals are chosen as:

where i = 1,2, s(n) is a chip of a chaotic signal and N is even. 

A typical binary DCSK signal x(n) corresponding to the symbol sequence {1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0} 
using the tent map fj(-) from Eq. (6) as the chaotic generator is shown in Figure 3. Symbols 
"1" and "0" are transmitted using *i(w) = y/E^s\{ri) and Xjin) = ^/Ei^in) respectively. The 
number of samples per symbol is N = 50 and Ej = 1.

samples and E{, = 1. 

In the DCSK signal, information is mapped on the correlation between the reference chip (0 < 
n < N/2) and the information-bearing chip (N/2 < n < N). Thus, one may demodulate the 
signal with a differential receiver, besides the coherent correlation receiver (Lathi, 1998).

The block diagram of a differential DCSK receiver is shown in Figure 4. The received signal 
is delayed by N/2, half of its duration and the correlation between the received signal and 
its delayed version is determined. The observation variable z m \ is obtained by sampling the 
output of the correlator at time (N â 1).

3.2 The energy per symbol variability problem and FM-DCSK 

For a conventional modulation scheme using only one periodic basis function Si (n) composed 
of N samples per symbol as an integer multiple of the period of Sj (n), the energy per symbol 
is given by 

and is constant for each distinct symbol. In contrast, chaotic signals are by definition aperiodic. 
Thus, when using a chaotic basis, Sj (n) is different at each interval and 



EÂ£M(Â») 



(10) 



is different for each transmitted symbol. 

In the periodic case, all values of E s j are equal to J3 â=o s l ( n ) w ith zero variance. In the chaotic 

case, the values of E s i are centered at E Â£ n=D I s i( M ) w ith non-zero variance. 

Compared to conventional systems, the fact that the energy per symbol is not constant 

is a major disadvantage of the communication systems using chaotic signals discussed so 

far. For them, errors in reception can occur even in ideal noiseless channels, which is 

undesirable in practice. Increasing the number of points N does not solve the problem as 

the standard deviation in the estimate of E s i falls slowly with N (Kennedy, Setti & Rovatti, 

2000). Furthermore increasing the number of transmitted points per symbol also limits the 

maximum transmission rate. 

An alternative solution is to modify the modulation scheme so that the transmitted energy 

for each symbol is kept constant. That is the aim of Frequency Modulated DCSK (FM-DCSK) 

(Kolumban, Kennedy, Kis & Jako, 1998). 

The FM-DCSK transmitter generates a DCSK signal with constant energy per symbol. The 

idea is to take advantage of the fact that the power of a frequency modulated signal is 

independent of the signal, as long as it is slowly-varying compared to the carrier (Lathi, 1998). 

Thus, the chaotic signal is fed into a frequency modulator. If the output of this modulator is 

used in implementing DCSK, then the output of the correlator at the receiver will be a constant 

in the absence of noise and the problem of energy variability disappears. 

For its simulation and analysis, the equivalent discrete time low-pass model of the FM-DCSK 

may be obtained by considering a reference chip described by 



,(f)=Acos[27r(/o + K / 8(t))*] 



0< t < 



(11) 



Applying Estimation Techniques to Chaos-based Digital Communications 



261 



where T is the symbol period, /g is the carrier frequency, A and Kt are constants (Lathi, 1998). 
The constant Kc that defines the modulation intensity is heretofore taken as 1. Hence, one can 
rewrite Eq. (11) as 



x m (t) = A [cos(2ns(t)t) cos{2nf t) - sin(2ns (t)t) sin(27r/ f)] , 



(12) 



with < t < T/2. Thus, according to Eq. (2), the discrete-time low-pass equivalent of this 
chip of x,â(t) becomes 



x m (n) = A [cos(2ns(n)n)+jsm(2ns(n)n)] = Aei 2nn < n) 



(13) 



with < n < N/2, N even. 

Note that |x m (n)| = A for any n. We adopt A 

signal with energy Ej, and 



Ei 



-jj- so that each symbol is represented as a 



,(n) = J|U 2 â¢ S ("), < n 



<N/2. 



(14) 



The information-bearing chip occupies the time slot N/2 < n < N and repeats the reference 

chip for m = 1 or is equal to its opposite for m = 2. 

A block diagram of a low-pass equivalent FM-DCSK signals generator is shown in Figure 5. 




Fig. 5. Block diagram of a discrete-time FM-DCSK signals generator, m = 1, 2. 

Figure 6 shows the real and imaginary part of the low-pass equivalent x(n) of an FM-DCSK 
signal for the symbol sequence {1,1,0,1,0,0,1,0} using N = 50 samples per symbol and 
E(, = 1. Again symbol "1" and "0" are transmitted using X\(n) and *2( M ) respectively using 
iterations of Eq. (6) to generate s(Â«). 

3.3 Comparison of performance in AWGN channel 

Next we consider the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) channel performance of the 
afore mentioned modulations. For simplicity, only binary transmission systems using a single 
basis sequence Sj(m) are examined. As such the transmitted signals are x m (n) = x m iS\(n), 
m = 1,2. We denote by Â§i(n) the reference signal and by x' m (n) the noisy signal that arrives at 
the receiver: 

x' m (n) = x m (n) + r(n) = x ml si{n) +r(n), (15) 

where r{n) is zero mean AWGN with power a .

{ 1, 1, 0, 1,0, 0,1,0} using N = 50 samples and E b = 1. 

3.3.1 Non-coherent correlation receiver 

In a non-coherent correlation receiver, as shown in Figure 1(b), the reference signal Sj(n) 
is equal to the signal that reaches the receiver x' m (n) = x m (n) + r(n) and the observed 
component can be expressed as 



N-l N-l N-l N-l 

zÂ«ti = E (*,Â«(Â«) + KÂ«)) 2 = E 4(Â«)+2 E *Â»(Â»MÂ»Â») + E r2 (Â«)- ( 16 ) 

h=0 h=0 ;;=0 n=0 



In the noiseless case, r(n) = and the expected value of the observed component is equal to 
the mean energy of the transmitted symbol, xjL, . 

The presence of noise in the channel causes the expected value of the random variable z m \ to 
differ from xz,,. The expected value of z m \ depends on the chaotic signal and on the noise 
power as expressed by the first and third terms of the right member of Eq. (16), respectively. 
In this case, z m \ is a biased estimator of the energy ofx m (n) and the threshold used at the comparator 
decision circuit explicitly depends on the noise level. The way to produce an unbiased estimator 
with larger distance between the observed component symbols is to use coherent CSK or 
DCSK. 



3.3.2 Coherent correlation receiver with chaotic synchronization 

Let Â§i (n) be the chaotic basis function recovered so that Â§\{n) ~ S\(n) for n > Ng l/nc in Figure 

1(a). 

One drawback of the coherent CSK receiver is that synchronization is lost and recovered each 

time a new symbol is transmitted (Kennedy, Setti & Rovatti, 2000). Thus, Ngy nc samples of 

each symbol are required for synchronization. In other words synchronization time imposes 

an upper bound on the symbol rate and thus on the data rate. 

As the synchronization transient can not be used to transmit information, the observed 

component is obtained by correlation only in the interval Ng l/nc < n < N â 1. Let x m (n), 

m = 1,2, be the transmitted signals for the CSK binary modulation with a single basis 



Applying Estimation Techniques to Chaos-based Digital Communications 263 

sequence Sj (n). Then, the observed component is given by 

N-l N-l 

z m i = Â£ [x m (n)+r(n)]Â§i(n)= Â£ [xâ a s 1 (n) + r(n)]si(n) = 

n=N Sy nc n=Ns W c 

N-l N-l 

= x m \ Yu s i(")si(")+ Yu r ( n )h{n). (17) 

n=N Sync n=N S}l â c 

Assuming that r(n) andsj(w) are uncorrelated, the mean value of z m \ is independent of noise; 

thus, the receiver becomes an unbiased estimator of x m \; in particular, the decision level in the 

comparator does not depend on the noise level in the channel. 

As with conventional coherent receivers that use periodic basis functions, the performance 

of coherent receivers that use chaotic basis functions under AWGN is theoretically optimal 

(Lathi, 1998). However, the BER also depends on synchronization quality, i.e., the closeness 

between the reference signal Si(Â«) and the original chaotic basis function S\(n). Any 

synchronization error, especially the loss of synchronization, leads to large performance 

degradation (Kennedy, Setti & Rovatti, 2000). 

Chaos synchronization techniques published to date are very sensitive to noise. In particular, 

the basis functions s,(Â«) can not be recovered exactly when x' ln (n) ^ x m (n) (Kennedy, Setti 

& Rovatti, 2000; Williams, 2001). This makes receivers based on chaotic synchronization 

unsuitable for propagation environments with low SNR. 

The number of samples Ng l/nc needed for synchronization is another factor that degrades the 

performance of these systems under noise. As no information can be transmitted during the 

synchronization transient, the energy corresponding to that signal section is lost implying BER 

degradation. 

Thus, even though coherent correlation CSK receivers outperform non-coherent ones by 

providing an unbiased transmitted symbol estimator, its performance depends critically 

on the ability to regenerate the basis functions at the receiver. The existing chaotic 

synchronization techniques are insufficiently robust for practical wireless communication 

systems (Williams, 2001). 

3.3.3 Differential receiver 

In a differential receiver for DCSK or FM-DCSK, the reference signal s(n) is a delayed version 
of the noisy signal that reaches the receiver, as was shown in Figure 4. Note that different 
noise samples corrupt the correlator entries. The observed component is given by 



N-l 

2ml = Y [x m {n) + r{n)\ 



N\ ( N 

n ~ ~lj +r v"~ 2~ 



(18) 



Substituting Eqs.(4) and (8) in Eq.(18) gives the observed component for DCSK as 

N-l _N-1 / xrx _N-1 / M \ 

2*1 =(-l) m+1 E* Â£s 2 ( M ) + yE7E r(n) S (n-y)+(-ir +1 v^i Â£ s (Â«) r (n-Â£) +

Chaotic Systems 



assuming s(tt) = s in â -^ ) for N/2 < n < N. 

For DCSK, the mean value of the first term is Ef,/2 or â E(,/2. In the equivalent FM-DCSK 

case, the transmitted symbol energy value is constant and equal to Ej,/2 or â Ej,/2. The other 

three terms containing the AWGN sequence are zero mean. This shows that z m \ is an unbiased 

estimator of Â±Â£^/2 in this case. The decision level is zero and independent of the noise level 

in the channel. 

In the DCSK case, the variance of z m \ is determined by the statistical variability of the energy 

per symbol of the chaotic signal and by the noise power in the channel. Therefore, the 

uncertainty in the energy estimation also influences the performance of DCSK. 

For the FM-DCSK, the first term of Eq.(19) equals Â±E{,/2 and the uncertainty in the energy 

estimation does not appear, also the decision threshold is fixed and there is no need for chaotic 

synchronization. This makes FM-DCSK superior to the other previous chaotic modulations 

schemes in terms of performance in AWGN channel. 

In Figure 7 we numerically evaluate the performance of the analyzed systems in terms of BER 

as a function of Ei,/Nq for N = 10 . The white noise power spectral density in the channel 

is No/2. As expected, it is clear that the FM-DCSK is the one that has the best performance 

among them. This is so basically because the energy per symbol is kept constant in this system. 

Still, its performance is below that of its counterpart using sinusoidal carriers, the Differential 

Phase Shift Keying (DPSK). In DPSK the knowledge of the basis functions by the receiver, 

allows the use of matched filters or correlation which improves its BER for a given Â£(,/Nq 

(Lathi, 1998).

Though FM-DCSK has the best features among the analyzed chaotic systems, it is important 
to note that no information concerning the dynamics of the chaotic map is used in its 
demodulation. Its performance would be essentially the same in case random sequences were 
used instead of chaotic ones. 

If knowledge of the dynamics of the generator map were used in demodulation process, 
certainly better results could be obtained, as in conventional systems that use matched filters. 

3.4 Chaotic modulations summary 

Thus far we presented some of the most studied modulation systems using chaotic signals. 
Their performance in AWGN channel was qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed. 
The discrete-time notation used here is a contribution of this chapter as it is consistent with the 
maps used in the generation of chaotic signals and also simplifies computational simulations. 
Table 1 summarizes the problems encountered in the main digital modulations described. The 
column Threshold concerns the problem of dependence of the decision threshold on the noise 
power in the channel. The column Energy represents the problem of variability of energy per 
symbol. The column Sync, means the need for recovery of basis chaotic functions at the 
receiver and the last column, Map Info when signaled means that the system does not use 
properties of the chaotic attractor in the estimation of the transmitted symbol.

Table 1. Problems of chaotic modulations studied in the section. 

Among the modulations studied, FM-DCSK has the best results because it does not depend 

on chaotic synchronization, its decision level threshold is independent of noise and it has 

constant mean energy per symbol. 

The analyzed non-coherent and differential receivers have a common feature: they do not use 

any characteristic of the dynamics of the systems that generate the chaotic signals to process 

the demodulation. These techniques are limited to estimating characteristics of the received 

signal and to comparing them to an adequate decision threshold. 

A priori knowledge of generating maps by the receiver can be used in two ways: 

i. via chaotic synchronization using coherent demodulation or 

ii. via improving signal to noise ratio or by distinguishing them through techniques to 
estimate the chaotic signals arriving at the receiver. 

The presence of noise and distortion in the channel brings unsatisfactory results when using 
chaotic synchronization due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions that characterize 
chaotic signals (Kennedy, Setti & Rovatti, 2000; Lau & Tse, 2003; Williams, 2001). Hence the 
only remaining option is to examine the second alternative. 

Some estimation techniques for orbits and initial conditions based on maximizing likelihood 
functions (Eisencraft et al., 2009; Kisel et al., 2001) have been proposed recently, yielding 
results better than those presented in this section. The rest of the chapter is devoted to these 
techniques.

4. Chaotic signal estimation 

Assume that an N-point sequence s'(n) is observed whose model is given by 

s'(n)=s(n) + r(n),0<n<N-l, (20) 

where s(n) is an orbit of the known one-dimensional system 

s(n)=/(s(n-l)) (21) 

and r(n) is zero mean AWGN with variance a . The /(.) map is defined over the interval 11. 

The problem is to obtain an estimate s(n) of the orbit s(n). 

The Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB), the minimum mean square error that an estimator of 

the initial condition s(0) can attain, was derived by Eisencraft & Baccala (2006; 2008). 

Let the estimation gain G^g in decibels be given by 



J dB 



10 log â , (22) 



be the figure of merit, where e = (Â§(n) â s(n)) 2 is the mean square estimation error. 

We succinctly review two estimation techniques for noise-embedded chaotic signals: the 

Maximum Likelihood (ML) Estimator and the Modified Viterbi algorithm (MVA). 

4.1 Maximum likelihood estimator 

The ML estimator of some scalar parameter 9 is the value that maximizes the likelihood 
function p(x;9) for the observation vector x (Kay, 1993). What motivates this definition is 
that p(x;9)dx represents the probability of observing x within a neighborhood given by dx for 
some value of 9. In the present context, it was first used by Papadopoulos & Wornell (1993) 
who show that the estimation gain for an N-point orbit generated by a map with uniform 
invariant density (Lasota & Mackey, 1985) is limited by 

G rfB <101og(N + l). (23) 

which asymptotically corresponds to the Cramer-Rao performance bound. 

4.2 Modified Viterbi algorithm 

This algorithm is based on that proposed by Dedieu & Kisel (1999) and was generalized for 

maps with nonuniform invariant density by Eisencraft & do Amaral (2009). 

Consider the domain U as the union of disjoint intervals Lf ,-, j = 1, 2, . . . , N$. At a given instant 

n, let the signal state be q(n) = j if s(w) Â£ lit. A (k + l)-length state sequence is represented 

by 

q k =[q(Q),q(l) q(k)] T (24) 

and the first k + 1 observed samples by 

sÂ£=[s'(0),s'(l) s'(fc)] T . (25) 

To simplify notation, consider the N-length sequences qjv_i = qands^j = s'. Furthermore, 
the center of interval U; is denoted by B(j). 



Applying Estimation Techniques to Chaos-based Digital Communications 267 



Given s', an estimated state sequence q is sought that maximizes the posterior probability 
Using Bayes' theorem, 



P(qls') =maxP(q]s'). (26) 

q 



p(q|s0 = FWM, (27) 

where p(s') and p(s'|q) are, respectively, the Probability Density Function (PDF) of s' and the 
PDF of s' given that the state sequence of the signal is q. The probability P(q) is the chance of 
obtaining the state sequence q when /(.) is iterated. 
Thus, the argument q is such that 

q = argmaxP(q|s') = argmaxp(s'|q)P(q). (28) 

q q 

It is important to note that because of the AWGN model and of how signals are generated, q^ 
is a first order Markov process where k is the time variable. Thus 

P(q k ) = P(q(k)\q(k-l))P(q k _ 1 ), (29) 

where P (q(k)\q(k â 1)) is the transition probability from the state q(k â 1) to q(k). 
Furthermore, taking into account the independence between the noise samples, 

k k k 

p(s' k \q k ) = n V (o'(n)k(n)) = fl *(*'(Â«) - *(")) Â« U Pr (Â«'(") - B (<?(Â«))) , (30) 

h=0 Â«=0 Â»=0 

with p r (-) standing for the noise PDF. The approximation in Eq. (30) holds only for sufficiently 
large N s . 

Using Eqs. (28-30), one can express P(q|s') as a product of state transition probabilities by 
conditional observation probabilities. Hence q is the sequence that maximizes 

N-l \ 

]1 P (?(n)k(Â« - 1)) V (s'(n)k(n)) P (<?(0)) . (31) 

Â«=i / 

Choosing the partition II;, j = 1,2, ... , Ng so that the probability of each possible state q(n) = j 
is the same for all /, the last term in Eq. (31), P (ij(0) ), can be eliminated leading to 

N-l 
q = argmax ]J P (q(n)\q(n - 1)) p (s'(n)\q(n)), (32) 

q n=\ 

as in (Kisel et al., 2001). Note, however, the central role played by the choice of the partition 

in obtaining this result as recently pointed out by Eisencraft et al. (2009). 

Finding q that maximizes the product in Eq. (32) is a classic problem whose efficient solution 

is given by the Viterbi Algorithm (Forney, 1973; Viterbi, 1967), which was first applied to the 

estimation of chaotic signals by Marteau & Abarbanel (1991). The main advantage in its use 

lies in dispensing with exhaustive search on the ( Ng ) possible state sequences for an N-point 

signal. 

Let y(n,j) be the probability of the most probable state sequence, in the maximum likelihood 

sense, that ends in state j, at instant n > 1, given the observed sequence s', or 

j(n,j) = maxP(qâ_ 1 ,i?(n) = />'). (33) 

qâ 



268 Chaotic Systems 

Using Eqs. (29-30), y(n,j) can be calculated recursively 

y(n,j) = max ]^[n - 1, i)Â«</] bj (s'(n)) , (34) 



for n > 1 where 
and 



a ij = P(q(n)=j\q(n-l) = i) (35) 



fe i ( S '(H))=p(s'(n)| (? (n)=7). (36) 

The coefficients sÂ« are the state transition probabilities that depend on the map /(.) and on 
the partition. Let the transition probability matrix be given by 

A NsxNs =a ij ,l<i,j<N s . (37) 

The &;(.) coefficients represent the observation conditional probabilities that depend only on 

the noise PDF p ,â {â )â  

The Viterbi algorithm proceeds in two passes, the forward one and the backward one: 

â¢ Forward pass: for each instant 1 < n < N â 1, Eqs. (33 - 34) are used to calculate 7(w,j) 
for the Ng states. Among the N$ paths that can link states j = 1, . . . , N$ at instant n â 1 
to state j at instant n, only the most probable one is maintained. The matrix <p(n,j), n = 
1, . . . , N â 1, j = 1, . . . , N$, stores the state at instant n â 1 that takes to state j with maximal 
probability. In the end of this step, at instant n = N â 1, we select the most probable state 
asq(N-l). 

* Backward pass: for obtaining the most probable sequence, it is necessary to consider the 
argument i that maximizes Eq. (34) for each n and j. This is done defining 

q{n) = cp{n + l,q{n + l)), n = N-2,...,0. (38) 

Once obtained q(n), the estimated orbit is given by the centers of the subintervals related to 
the most probable state sequence, 

Â§(n) = B(q{n)), n = Q,...,N-l. (39) 

4.2.1 Partition of the state space 

To apply the algorithm one must choose a partition so that the probability of an orbit point to 
be in any state is the same, to eliminate P (q(0) ) in Eq. (31). This means that if a given map has 
invariant density p(s) (Lasota & Mackey, 1985), one should take Ng intervals IL- = [u;;Uj+i] 
so that, for every j = 1, . . . , N$, 

/ p(s)ds = â . (40) 

Using the ergodicity of chaotic orbits (Lasota & Mackey, 1985), it is possible to estimate p(s) 

for a given /(.) and thereby obtain the correct partition. 

The maps taken as examples by Xiaofeng et al. (2004) and Kisel et al. (2001) have uniform 

invariant density and the authors proposed using equal length subintervals. However, this 

choice is not applicable to arbitrary one-dimensional maps. When using Viterbi algorithm 

with the correct partition, it is called here Modified Viterbi Algorithm (MVA) (Eisencraft et al, 

2009).

For each SNRjn of the input sequence, the average SNR ou t of 1000 estimates is shown. 
Choosing the right partition, the estimation algorithm has an increasing performance as a 
function of SNRi n until SNR ou t attains a limit value which depends on Ng. This limiting 
value can be calculated assuming that, in the best possible case, the estimation error is 
caused by domain quantization alone. As such, for an uniform partition, the estimation error 
is an uniformly distributed random variable in the interval [â1/Ng,l/Ng]. Therefore the 
mean squared value of s(n) â s(n) is limited by 1/ (3N|). Additionally, s(n) is uniformly 
distributed in [â1,1] and, consequently, has a mean squared value of 1/3. Hence if all the 
points are in the correct subintervals, the expected value of SNR ou t, Â£[SNR 0U t] in dB is

These limits, which are exact only in the uniform partition case, are indicated with dashed 

lines for each Ng value in Figures 10 and 11. 

Comparing Figures 11(a) and (b) reveals the critical role played by the partition choice. Clearly 

the uniform partition of Xiaofeng et al. (2004) and Kisel et al. (2001) cannot attain the best 

possible SNRout for the quadratic map whose invariant density is not uniform. 

Figures 10 and 11(b) show that the algorithm has slightly better performance for the quadratic 

map. This result confirms the importance of map choice.

dashed lines. 

4.3 Comparing MVA and MLE 

MLE's performance is strongly influenced by the length of the estimated orbit N, as shown by 

inequality (23). MVA is more sensitive to the number of subsets N$ used in the partition. 

Simulations show that the gain obtained via MLE monotonically increases with Signal to 

Noise Ratio (SNR) being bounded by the CRLB. Using MVA, the gain attains a maximum 

value and decays and even becomes negative (in dB) due to quantization error. So the Ng 

choice is a very important concern for MVA and it is a function of the expected SNR. 

The estimation gain for both methods on tent map orbits from Eq. (6) corrupted by AWGN is 

shown in Figure 12. For the MVA only the N = 20 result is depicted as simulations show little 

improvement for larger N. 

From Figure 12 one can see that for SNR < 20dB, which is the usual operating range, MVA's 

performance is superior. 

These results, plus the fact that MVA can be simply applied to broader map classes have 

induced the choice of MVA in the communication applications described next. 



5. Chaotic signal estimation applied to communication 

In this section we propose two binary digital modulation using chaotic system identification. 
They are the Modified Maximum Likelihood Chaos Shift Keying (MMLCSK) using one and two 
maps. Both are based on the ones proposed by Kisel et al. (2001). We have modified them 
using nonuniform partitions for the MVA as discussed in the previous section. In this way, it 
is possible to test the performance of nonuniform invariant density maps.

5.1 MMLCSK using two maps 

In this case, each symbol is associated with a different map, f\(.) or /2(.). To transmit a "0", 
the transmitter sends an N-point orbit Sj (.) of f\ (.) and to transmit a "1" it sends an N-point 
orbit S2(.) of fz(.). 

Maps must be chosen so that their state transition probabilities matrix (Eq. (37)) Aj and A2 
are different. Estimating S\(n) using MVA with A2 must produce a small estimation gain or 
even a negative (in dB) one. The same must happen when we try to estimate S2(n) using A\. 
The receiver for MMLCSK using two maps is shown in Figure 13. The Viterbi decoders try to 
estimate the original s(n) using Aj or A2. For each symbol, the estimated state sequences are

In these equations the likelihood measure of Eq. (32) was used. The probability P(q(n)\q(n â 

1), A;) can be read directly from A, and p(x'(n)\cj(n)) depends only on the noise and can be 

approximated as described by Dedieu & Kisel (1999). 

Choosing the largest between z m \ e z m2 allows identifying the map used in the transmitter with 

maximum likelihood and thereby decode the transmitted symbol. 

Given some f\{) map, an important problem is to find the matching /2(.) map so that 

its probability transition matrix A 2 permits optimal discrimination between the likelihood 

measures of Eqs. (47) and (48). For piecewise linear maps on the interval U = [â 1, 1] we can 

use the following rule adapted from (Kisel et al., 2001):

It can be shown that almost every orbit generated by / 2 (.) is in fact chaotic (Kisel et al., 2001). 

Note however that this method is not necessarily optimal and must be used prudently. There 

is no guarantee that the orbits of / 2 (.) given by Eq. (49) are chaotic in general. 

For instance, if we apply the same strategy for the quadratic map f\ (s) = fn(s) from Eq. (41), 

we obtain / 2 (s) show in Figure 14(b). All the orbits of / 2 (.) converge to a stable fixed point at 

s = and hence are not chaotic at all (Alligood et al., 1997). 

In the simulations presented here / 2 (.) = ~fn(-) as shown in Figure 14(c). This map is 

possibly not optimum because points next to the roots of /i(.) and / 2 (.) are mapped near 

to each other by both functions. The transition matrix for these two maps for Ng = 5 using 

the partition obeying Eq. (40) are

performance when compared to the one with matrices given by Eq. (50). 

To find /2(.) given a map f\ (.) that presents optimal properties when it comes to identification 

through matrices Aj and A2 is an open problem. As shown by the last example, it is necessary 

to impose that/2(.) generates chaotic orbits.

5.2 MMLCK using one map 

As an alternative, it is possible to construct a communication system based on MVA estimation 

using just one map. In this case, according to the symbol that is intended to be communicated, 

the chaotic signal is directly transmitted or an invertible transformation is applied on the 

sequence. This operation must modify the sequence so that it is no longer a valid orbit of the 

map which dispenses with finding an /2(.) map. 

In the binary case, for maps that are not odd, this transformation can be, for instance, T(s) = 

â s which can be undone by multiplying the sequence by â 1 . To transmit a 0, an N-point orbit 

Sj(.) of /i(.) is sent. To transmit a 1 is sent â si(.). 

The receiver for this system is shown in Figure 16. The variables z m \ and z m 2 are calculated 

by Eq. (47). However, when calculating z m i, s'(n) is substituted by â s (n). So, when a is 

received, the likelihood expressed by z m \ must be greater than z m i because â S\{n) is not an 

orbit of /i(-). The opposite is true when a 1 is received. 

It is relevant to note that this scheme can be easily generalized to M-ary modulation, M > 2. 

For this all that is needed is to consider other invertible transformations.

identification process Ng = 100 subsets and N = 50 samples per bit were used. For the 
sake of comparison, the performance of Chaos On-Off Keying (COOK) (the best performing 
non-coherent chaos communication system that does not use estimation) is also shown 
(Kolumban, Kennedy & Chua, 1998). COOK uses only bit energy estimation to decode the 
signal. MMLCSK performs much better than COOK. The attained BER, however, is still far 
from that of conventional Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK).

6. Conclusions 

In this chapter we reviewed some chaos-based digital communication systems and studied 
their performance in a noisy environment. 

In Section 3 we described CSK, DCSK and FM-DCSK using a discrete-time low-pass unifying 
notation. We concluded that FM-DCSK has the best performance among them. However the 
BER it attains in an AWGN channel is still unsatisfactory compared to conventional systems. 
This occurs mainly because FM-DCSK does not use any characteristic of the system that 
generate the chaotic signals to process the demodulation. 

One possible way for improvement is to use estimation techniques to increase the SNR at the 
receiver. We review two such estimation techniques in Section 4, MLE and MVA. Due to its 
superior characteristics, we used the latter to propose two binary digital modulation schemes 
using chaotic signal estimation. Despite presenting better BER performance than the previous 
proposals, chaos based modulations still have a long way to go before they can attain the 
same performance level of conventional systems and so become practical options in noisy 
environments.

1. Introduction 

This introduction describes contemporary investigations and interpretations of Kauffman 
networks, especially in the context of the 'life on the edge of chaos' hypothesis. The Kauffman 
networks are known as Boolean networks. They were introduced by Kauffman (1969), and 
later investigated and developed by many authors. These networks take various forms, e.g. 
cellular automata which stress the spatial order of their nearest neighbours as connection 
pattern. I will not consider such specific forms. Generally, this approach for the description of 
living systems, or a system designed by humans, using dynamical directed networks is now 
one of the most attractive and promising tools. His 'The Origins of Order' (Kauffman, 1993) 
is a large summary of first period Boolean network investigations and a base for the usually 
agreed on 'life on the edge of chaos' hypothesis. Later this hypothesis was 'experimentally 
verified' using the Gene Regulatory Network model (Ramo et al., 2006; Serra et al., 2004; 2007; 
Shmulevich et al., 2005; Wagner, 2001) but in this paper I call into question this verification. 
My explanation is based on an interpretation where stability and chaos play the main role. 
This introduction is designed as a description of Kauffman networks and their variants and 
extensions, in order to make my arguments comprehensible. No previous knowledge about 
the Kauffman network is assumed. 

1.1 Elements, structure, functions and parameters of Boolean networks 

In Fig. 1 the depicted Boolean network is small. It consists of N = 5 nodes named G, E, A, P 
and S. I show here a simple, imagined gene regulatory network of a plant. Node G describes 
the decision: 'to grow, or not to grow'. It depends on two detected parameters of the 
environment: w - warm - temperature sufficient for growth; and / - sufficient day length. 
In the winter it is not warm (w = means: false) and days are short (/ = 0) which is the 
environment state at time shown in the Table on the left. For the decision 'to grow' (g = 1) 
both warmth (iv = 1) and spring (/ = 1) are needed which is calculated using Boolean function 
AND (g := I AND iv) performed by node G. Input signals / and w are taken as they are at 
time step t but a result g appears in the next (t + 1) time step. Such an updating scheme is 
called 'synchronous mode'. There are a few updating schemes, but for the main questions this 
fact it is not very important (Gershenson, 2004). The result g of node function calculation is 



282 



Chaotic Systems 



called 'state of node' G. It also is an output signal of node G which is sent to other nodes as 
their input signals through output links of node G. There is k = 2 of output links (also called 
outputs) of node G. Number k for a particular node of network can be any, it is called 'node 
degree'. Distribution of node degree k for a particular network defines the network type. It 
will be discussed later. It is easy to add or remove an output link of node in Boolean network 
because it does no change node function. The input signals I and w come to node G through 
its input links. Arrows show direction of signal movement through the link, therefore the 
network is 'directed'.

Fig. 1. Example of Boolean network, its basic elements (on the right) and function (on the 
left). 

Node G has K = 2 input links (also called inputs). Usualy is assumed that each node of 
the network has the same fixed number K of input links. It is a useful approximation and 
I use it also, but more recently flexible K in one particular network is often used. It is 
not so easy to add or remove node input while simulation of the Boolean network is being 
processed because it changes the number of function variables and in effect it changes the 
node function. Fortunately Serra et al. (2007) prove that distribution of damage size depends 
upon the distribution of k only, and does not depend upon the topology of the inputs. 
The environment also can contains substrate /. This substrate is present in the plant (s) if it is 
present in the environment (/ = 1) OR produced by the plant (p) using its internal reserve (r). 
As can be seen in the table, substrate / is present in the environment at the beginning and the 
plant also has a reserve r for the production of p. An effect e of the 'to grow' (g) decision can 
occur if substrate s is present in the plant which depicts node Â£. However, if the decision g is 
taken but substrate s is absent (s = 0) which happen at time step 4, then alarm a happens in 
the next time step. If alarm a occurs, then the plant can use its reserve r and produce substitute 
substrate p which is ready at time step 6. But because of the restriction taken before (e.g. K = 2 
for all nodes) and rules it can be available for Â£ and A only at time step 7 as s signal (the result 
of OR operation which takes a time). Effect e which disappeared at step 5 next appears at time 
8. Check the table of network states - it is defined by state in time and network structure with 
node functions. Such network is deterministic. The annealed approximation model discussed 
in Ch.2.2.3 is not deterministic (Derrida & Weisbuch, 1986). 



1 .2 Attractors, damage and chaos-order boundary 
1.2.1 Attractors and their basins 

A network contains a finite number N of nodes. The space of states of such a finite Boolean 
network also is finite and the network (system) must meet some previously left state in the 
finite number of time steps. In a deterministic network, from this time step the sequence of 



Emergence of Matured Chaos During, Network Growth, 

Place for Adaptive Evolution and More of Equally Probable Signal Variants as an Alternative... 283 

states must repeat ad infinitum. This repeated sequence of network states is called 'attractor'. 
It can be 'point attractor' if it is one stable state, otherwise it is circular attractor. One system 
(network) typically has lot of attractors. Not all of the system (network) states are elements of 
any attractor, but starting from any system state the network always reaches some attractor. 
The set of states leading to a particular attractor is called 'basin of attraction'. 
Kauffman (1969) has proposed that different types of cells in the animal body are an effect 
of different attractors of its common gene regulatory network (see also (Serra et al., 2010)). 
Therefore number and length of attractors for a network with a particular set of parameters is 
one of the main investigated themes. 

1.2.2 Damage spreading in chaotic and ordered systems 

If we start two identical deterministic systems A and B from the same state, then they will 
always have identical states. However, if a small disturbance is introduced in one of them 
(B), e.g. a changed state of one node, then some difference in node states between two such 
previously identical systems appears as an effect. These differences are called 'damage' (Jan 
& Arcangelis, 1994) (or 'perturbations' (Ram5 et al., 2006; Serra et al., 2004)). The damage is 
measured as a fraction of all N nodes which have a different state than in the not disturbed 
network and in this article are denotet by d. Note, < d < 1. 1 will also use damage measured 
on m = 64 network external outputs in number L of changed output signals. 
Damage can take various forms, e.g. it describes typically: epidemic spreading (Grabowski & 
Kosihski, 2004), opinion formation (Fortunato, 2005; Grabowski & Kosihski, 2006; Sousa, 2005) 
and attack or error effects (Crucitti et al., 2004; Gallos et al., 2004). However, these networks 
are not usually directed networks, and their important aspect is the spatial description which 
uses a particular lattice shape in the form of 'cellular automata'. 

The main characteristic of the chaotic (term: 'pseudochaotic' can be also found (Serra et al., 
2010)) behaviour of dynamical systems is high sensitivity to initial conditions. For chaotic 
systems (I use the term 'chaos' as Kauffman (1993) does) a small initiation of damage typically 
causes a large avalanche of damage which spreads onto a big part of the finite system and 
ends at an equilibrium level. The existence of this limitation is the main difference between 
this 'chaos' and the more commonly taken definition (Schuster, 1984) used for continuous 
arguments of a function. Levels of damage equilibrium are discussed in Ch.2.2.3 on a base of 
annealed approximation (Derrida & Pomeau, 1986; Kauffman, 1993). 

High stability of ordered systems does not allow for damage to evolve into a large avalanche. 
There could be a very small avalanche in 'small unfrozen lakes of activity' which I do 
not call 'avalanche', especially not a 'large avalanche'. However, it is only statistical law, 
and theoretically large avalanche can happen but not practically for randomly constructed 
networks. Unfortunately, Serra et al. (2004) have introduced on credit term 'avalanche' which 
is consequently used later (Ramo et al., 2006; Serra et al., 2010; Shmulevich et al., 2005), for 
damage size in range especially small 'avalanches', e.g. to 6 damaged nodes. This credit 
can be paid by damage in range of chaotic behaviour. I will come back to the view of 'frozen' 
areas, for the time being I want to introduce (fully in Ch.2.2.1 and in (Gecow, 1975; Gecow 
& Hoffman, 1983; Gecow, 2008) see also (Aldana et al., 2003; Serra et al., 2004)) 'coefficient 
of change multiplication on one node' also called 'coefficient of damage propagation' which 
simply shows why and when damage should grow. If a node has k outputs and on one input 
damage appears (changed input signal comparatively to undisturbed system), then on the 
average, W = k/2 outputs will be changed (damaged). Note that for k = 2 w = 1 which 
means that damage does not grow. For this coefficient a random function is assumed. Equal 



284 Chaotic Systems 

probability of both signals in Boolean network is also assumed. For completion 'internal 
homogeneity' P (Kauffman, 1993) should be kept minimal. The internal homogeneity P of 
a Boolean function is defined as the fraction of the 2 K positions with 1 values or with values 
depending on which fraction is higher, (P always is greater than 50 %) (Kauffman, 1993). If 
these assumptions are not true, then typically w < k/2. If K is fixed for an autonomous 
network (without external links from and to environment), then the average k is equal to K 
( (k) = K). For such a network K = 2 is a boundary of the radically different behaviour, which 
Derrida & Pomeau (1986) has found. This is called 'phase transition' - for K > 2 it is the 
chaotic phase where damage typically grows and for K < 2 it is an ordered phase where even 
large damage typically fades out. 

"Harris et al. (2002) pointed out that most biological systems tend to make use of a regulatory 
systems which, in the Boolean approximation, is described by canalising functions. ... A 
Boolean function is said to be canalising if at least one value of one of its inputs uniquely 
determines its output, no matter what the other input values are. Real gene networks show 
a proportion of canalising functions much higher than the one corresponding to a uniform 
choice"(Serra et al., 2004) (i.e. for K=2 without XOR and NOT XOR). 

An assumption of equal probability of both signals is too strong and from the beginning bias 
p - probability of one signal variant is considered. This method of description however, is not 
universal and I introduce an alternative which differs in interpretation and results. It is more 
than two equally probable signal variants which is one of the main themes of this article. 

1.2.3 Stability types, spontaneous order and negative feedbacks 

There are four similar terms used in the Kauffman approach which should be clearly 
separated: 'structural stability', 'homeostatic stability', 'ultrastability' and 'spontaneous 
order'. 

The 'structurally stable systems'(Kauffman, 1993) evolve in correlated landscape (e.g. of 
fitness) which typically allows the small initial change to give a small change as its effect. 
This landscape is considered on a space of system parameters where the nearest neighbours 
vary by the smallest change of connection, function or state. It means that such neighbours 
are similar and they function similarly. Chaotic systems are not 'structurally stable'. They 
evolve in uncorrelated landscape where small change typically causes crossing many 'walls of 
bifurcation', radically changing the system's properties (e.g. adding a new basin of attraction). 
Functions of neighbours typically are not similar (large damage avalanche means just this). 
Adaptive evolution needs small changes. Large change usually lost collected aptness (fitness). 
Kauffman's approach, therefore, looks for such a 'structurally stable' area and found that 
it occurs between the chaotic and ordered phase. For this reason in Kauffman's approach, 
the phase transition between chaos and order is one of the most important themes of the 
investigation. Kauffman isolates this area on the basis of effects for the evolvability and 
structure of fitness landscape as a third region called 'liquid'. This region lies between 'solid' 
(because frozen, i.e. constant states of nodes) ordered region and 'gas' - a chaotic region. 
"Landscape is very rugged in the chaotic regime. This ruggedness is a direct consequence of 
the fact that damage spreads widely in networks in the chaotic regime. Almost any single 
mutation will dramatically alter landscape structure" (Kauffman, 1993). Note - though not all 
mutation will cause a large alteration. A liquid region lies on formally ordered and chaotic 
regions and its boundaries are smooth and not well defined. John Holland (1998) named this 
region 'the edge-of-chaos membrane' but Serra et al. (2007) - the 'critical' state, zone or regime.

Place for Adaptive Evolution and More of Equally Probable Signal Variants as an Alternative... 285 

After a small initiation of damage the effected damage (perturbation, change) can be large 
or small. Minimizing of initiation's effect defines a homeostatic feature. Typical homeostatic 
mechanisms based on negative feedbacks are named 'ultrastability' in Kauffman's approach. 
Kauffman following Ashby (1960) uses 'essential variable' to describe them: "In the context 
of Boolean networks, keeping the essential variables in bounds corresponds most simply to 
holding them fixed" (page 211 in (Kauffman, 1993)). Therefore, later Kauffman looks for 
systems with 'frozen' areas and finds them near the phase transition. In the ordered phase, 
frozen areas 'percolate' (i.e. connect into one space) leaving small isolated lakes of activity 
inside which leads to 'homeostatic stability'. In the chaotic phase there are isolated islands of 
frozen areas. As can be seen in Fig. 3 (state of T = a, b, c), to model the regulation (mechanism 
of stability) using negative feedbacks, all variables (including essential ones) must be flexible. 
They cannot be 'frozen' because it is only a substitute for the regulations by their effects 

Or = b). 

Kauffman uses the term 'homeostatic stability' for the general resistance of the system to 
disturbance. This resistance refers mainly to stability which emerges spontaneously together 
with spontaneous order. Due to practical rejection of ultrastability from this research (more 
in (Gecow, 2010)), homeostatic stability contains the only aspect of spontaneous resistance to 
disturbance which in effect leads to overestimation of spontaneous order. 
The ordered area and its near vicinity, where maximum spontaneous order occurs, also 
exhibit the highest 'structural stability'. This is useful for adaptive evolution and 'homeostatic 
stability' which should be an effect of evolution. The maximum of spontaneous order is one 
of the most important features of this area. For Boolean networks (with equal probability of 
signal versions) it is the case of K = 2: "If the stability of each state cycle attractor is probed by 
transient reversing of the activity of each element in each state of the state cycle, then 80-90% 
of all such perturbations, the system flows back to the same state cycle. Thus state cycles are 
inherently stable to most minimal transient perturbations" (Kauffman, 1993). 

1.2.4 Hypothesis of 'life on the edge of chaos' 

Evolution using random walk in the space of network parameters should lean towards this 
ordered area because changes are smaller there; the system is more stable and the effects of 
evolution may be larger. This expectation is known as 'life on the edge of chaos'. Kauffman 
even expects living systems in solid regime in his "bold hypothesis: Living systems exist 
in solid regime near the edge of chaos, and natural selection achieves and sustains such a 
poised state" - page 232 in (Kauffman, 1993). I question the use of 'natural selection' as a 
typical Darwinian meaning. It needs elimination which is based on death. On the edge of 
chaos there is not anything which models death. Such a model of death can be found in the 
chaotic phase as large damage avalanche. Above Kauffman's view as useful approximation 
for certain purpose is correct if description is limited to live period without death possibility 
and Darwinian mechanisms. However, in such a case natural selection (working outside) 
cannot 'achieve' but only 'sustain' the state which is connected to reproduction ability. 
A large change; large damage avalanche in chaotic systems, is obviously taken as improbable 
in adaptive evolution but the conclusion that adaptive evolution is improbable in chaotic 
systems would be too hasty. As noted above (in the description of the liquid region) in chaotic 
systems, small change only typically causes large effective change. Small effective changes 
can also take place. They may be used by adaptive evolution. It happens more frequently 
if parameters of a network are nearer the phase transition between order and chaos. This 
possibility is discussed in Ch.2.3 in Fig.6 as degrees of order r and chaos c (r + c = 1) of 



286 Chaotic Systems 

different particular networks and it is one of more important themes of this paper. See also 
Fig. 7 for s/3,4 in the middle on the right (typical case) where left peak of P(d\N) of very 
small damage is present for chaotic systems. This peak contains initiation cases which in 
effect manifest 'ordered' behaviour and can be used for adaptive evolution. Small networks 
where N = 50, behave like at the edge of chaos and order. This dependency remains as the 
left peak for larger N. Its distribution is near power law, like for the avalanches in the pile of 
sand which Per Bak's self-organized criticality (Bak, 1996) controls. But living systems have 
a method against such control - it is self-multiplying. In effect, some systems usually avoid 
large avalanche which for living systems means death, i.e. elimination. It cannot be a new 
evolutionary change (compare to (Farmer et al., 1986)). It is much more than even Lysenko 
proposed. Can you imagine that more than half (see Fig.5) of all the mechanisms of living 
organism have been changed and the organism survived? Replication allows living systems 
to grow (in N meaning) and this way they enter chaotic regime and can stay there. Above r 
(degree of order in Fig. 6) is a fraction of all initiation cases which contain cases building the 
left peak (of very small effective changes). The right peak contains cases of chaotic behaviour 
which must be eliminated during adaptive evolution by Darwinian elimination; they model 
death. This death is necessary for typical natural selection but in an ordered regime it is absent. 
(Theoretically Darwinian mechanism can work without death, but for this infinite capacities 
of environment are necessary.) 

1.2.5 Kauffman's model of gene regulatory network and its comparison to real life 

The model of gene regulatory network was proposed by Kauffman (1969; 1971), it is based 
on the Kauffman (Boolean) network. Boolean states of gene are interpreted as active or 
inactive. All general expectations for the Boolean network described above concern this 
gene regulatory network, including the nearest of chaos-order phase transition as an effect 
of evolution. 

Hughes et al. (2000) in real genome of Saccaromices cerevisiae containing N = 6312 genes, 
knocked out 227 genes, one at a time and they measured the effects of such disturbance. 
Next, the authors of Refs. (Ramo et al, 2006; Serra et al., 2004; 2007; Wagner, 2001) compared 
obtained stability to theoretical stability for different parameters. They conclude that similar 
stability appears for the Boolean network with fixed K=2, i.e. really near phase transition. 
Shmulevich et al. (2005) compare the amount of information stored in the time sequence of 
gene expression of HeLa cells with the results of simulated RBNs and they conclude that 
eukaryotic cells are dynamically ordered or critical but not chaotic. These results are taken as 
an experimental base for the 'life on the edge of chaos' hypothesis. 

Nevertheless, I dispute the interpretation of this result. First of all in both these 
experiments data are captured from practically living cells. Theoretical homeostatic stability 
underestimates ultrastability as its part, i.e. regulators based on negative feedbacks which are 
the base of stability for living systems. Ultrastability is commonly observed as an extremely 
high concentration of negative feedbacks in living systems which is even used for a life 
definition (Korzeniewski, 2001; 2005) as its specific property. Creation of these mechanisms 
is an effect of Darwinian selection (in which death, as mentioned above is needed; large 
avalanche of damage models this death). Because cells are alive, homeostasis was not broken 
and stability was kept. This means there was no large avalanche, i.e. death. But it does 
not mean that such large avalanche cannot appear and such cells are immortal. It is obvious 
true that living systems behave like ordered systems and it is expected result that description 
of these behaviours is similar to ordered systems build randomly. It is interesting result

Place for Adaptive Evolution and More of Equally Probable Signal Variants as an Alternative... 287 

that similarity is so deep. But it does not imply that source of such stability is similar. In 
Kauffman's approach negative feedbacks are considered only on a random normal average 
level of appearance without any preferences. This is a very large simplification (Gecow, 
2010) leading to a non-realistic modelling of stability causes of living systems. Obtained 
similarity has, however, simple explanation given by Kauffman - it is mentioned above 
simplification of ultrastability using fixed (frozen) essential variable. This move rejects out 
of consideration right source of stability together with its cause - Darwinian elimination 
but remains their effect. This is why, 'homeostatic stability' based on 'spontaneous order', 
i.e. typically 'structural stability', is taken as an explanation of stability of gene regulatory 
network (Kauffman, 1971; Ramo et al., 2006; Serra et al., 2004; 2007; Wagner, 2001) instead of 
the neglected homeostasis based on negative feedbacks which realize the regulation. This is 
the above mentioned (Ch.1.2.3) overestimation of spontaneous order. 

Homeostasis built by Darwinian selection leads to stability for a certain set of initial changes. 
Such changes may randomly occur but they are 'known' to the system, i.e. the system reacts to 
them in a non-random way. E.g. small defects in DNA copying are 'known' and a certain set 
of repair or other safety mechanisms are prepared. The remaining changes can be treated as 
'fully random'. When these changes occur, the system can behave in a chaotic or ordered 
way. The investigation should be focused on this set of 'fully random' changes but with 
stability of system in mind, it is important not to neglect 'known' changes. Current living 
things 'know' most of the typical changes and therefore exhibit high stability. This is true 
even though for fully random (unknown) changes these living systems are chaotic. Life is a 
continuous maintenance of equilibrium at a high level, which is a semi-unstable equilibrium 
- it will collapse into a large damage avalanche after a single false move. This view correctly 
describes a chaotic state but not an ordered one. Therefore, observed stability cannot be 
spontaneous, but it must be carefully collected. Only Darwinian selection can find observed 
stability and not in the form suggested by Kauffman (place near the ordered phase) but in 
the form of active regulation which are usually negative feedbacks. Kauffman, and I, do not 
model these homeostatic answers (based typically on negative feedbacks) which are effects of 
'known type initialisations' of the system. This large simplification, however, must be taken 
into consideration when stability of living systems is discussed. 

Currently Kauffman's model of the gene regulatory network is taken as 'early' and more 
attention is given to the GRN based on the Banzhaf model (Banzhaf, 2003; Knabe et al., 2006). 
Also 2 signal variants are taken as too strong a simplification. Nonetheless, Kauffman's model 
was a first approximation needed to open the way for more exact models. 

1 .3 Networks variants 

1.3.1 Currently investigated network types in the range RBN 

Kauffman (1969) introduced Boolean networks. For statistical investigation, a method of 
a random creation of such a network was needed. That time the obvious candidate was 
Erdos-Renyi pattern (Erdos & Renyi, 1960) where, for given node number N connections are 
chosen randomly. The number of inputs K was usually fixed and the above rule considers 
outputs k. This type of network was named 'Random Boolean Network' (RBN). 
Barabasi et al. (1999) have discovered the famous, scale free network and its importance, 
therefore it is known as the BA (Barabasi- Albert) network. It is constructed using 'preferential 
attachment', i.e. new added node links to a node in the current network with a probability 
proportional to its node degree k. BA networks typically are not directed and k is a number of 
all the links of the node. Using this formula for Boolean networks it is necessary to separately 



288 Chaotic Systems 

consider the number of inputs K and outputs k. Usually an easier fixed K was used (see 
Ch.1.1) but currently both of them are often flexible. The dynamics of Boolean networks with 
scale free topology were studied e.g. by Aldana (2003), Kauffman et al. (2004), Serra et al. 
(2004a) and Iguchi et al. (2007). They named the network SFRBN (Scale-Free RBN). Iguchi 
et al. (2007) also used for comparison 'directed Exponential-Fluctuation networks EFRBN' 
known also as a 'single scale' network where new node links to node in current network with 
equal probability. The old Classic RBN which Serra et al. (2004a) proposed to rename to CRBN 
is also used for comparison. All of these network types differ in P(k) - distribution of node 
degree: CRBN has Poisson distribution without hubs (nodes with extremely high node degree 
k), P(k) of SFRBN is a straight line in log-log diagram and contains many hubs, EFRBN gives 
a straight line in the log diagram and contain less hubs. 

Most authors stay with Boolean networks due to 'life on the edge of chaos' idea. For this 
reason, they investigate the point of phase transition between order and chaos. There are 
lots of different attempts to introduce a new type of Boolean network. E.g. in opposition to 
the deterministic case Shmulevich et al. (2002) introduced the Probabilistic Boolean Network 
(PBN). The PBN is used to model gene regulatory network where transition rules are 
considered as random variables. Such an idea in a slightly different form appears in "a 
Dynamical Boolean Network (DBN), which is a Virtual Boolean Network (VBN) In this 
network, the set of nodes is fixed but the transition matrix can change from one time step 
to another" (Ito, 2008). 

1 .3.2 Extension of the Kauffman networks over Boolean networks - RNS, RWN and my RSN 

Applying the Boolean networks to describe living things, e.g. for gene regulatory network, 
suggests that only two signal variants is a large simplifications - a first approximation only, 
and more variants should be used. I will come back to this problem later in Ch.2. As second 
approximation Luque & Sole (1997) introduced RNS (Random Network with multiple States) 
(Sole et al., 2000). In RNS, in order to reach edge of chaos a bias p is used for one signal 
variant making it different from the other signal variants. Later Luque & Ballesteros (2004) 
introduced another construction - RWN (Random Walk Network) (Ballesteros & Luque, 2005) 
which contains memory in its nodes' states. Functions of node perform a shift of node state 
which resemble differential regulations. This shifting reaches upper or lower boundaries and 
the result is random but in a complicated way. Construction of RWN also is an effect of the 
assumption that point of phase transition is important. 

To these two ideas I add (Gecow, 2010) another one, but now I await living systems in chaotic 
regime, so the point of phase transition is not so important. My network allows for more than 
two equally probable variants of signal values which is an exclusive alternative based on the 
interpretation to bias p. I introduce s - number of equally probable variants of signal values. I 
call (Gecow, 2010) such a network 'Random Signal Network' (RSN). (The full name: 'Random 
equally probable Signal variants Network' is too long.) Note, using parameter s in the range 
of RSN we know that these s variants are equally probable and in range s > 2. In the Boolean 
network there are only two variants e.g. 1 and but they must not to be equally probable. 
RSN, together with known RNS and RWN, expand the notion of the 'Kauffman network'. Up 
till now 'the Kauffman-' and 'the Boolean network' were synonymous, but they should not be 
anymore. The term 'Boolean' must be limited to two variants of a signal but the 'Kauffman 
network' can and should contain more signal variants as is used in the RSN, RWN or in RNS 
models. One output signal taken as a state of node which is transmitted through all output 
links should be characteristic of the Kauffman network.

1.3.3 Network types and their rules of growth used in simulation of RSN 

RSN is a directed functioning network. The main characteristic of the RSN, is that all signal 
value variants are equally probable and s; the number of these variants can be more than two 
s > 2. RSN type was performed for statistical analysis (typically using simulation) of general 
features of networks and their dependency on different parameters like K, k, s, N and growth 
rules. The basic formula of RSN emerged from an important overlooked cause of probability 
difference in Boolean's two signals (Ch.2.1.2) described using bias p. Such a description leads 
to wrong results in this case. So, RSN becomes the exclusive alternative to bias p. 
RSN term contains the Kauffman networks with two, and more than two equally probable 
signal variants. RSN also contains 'aggregates of automata' which I have introduced in 
(Gecow, 1975; Gecow & Hoffman, 1983; Gecow et al., 2005; Gecow, 2005a; 2008), with the 
same range of signals and which are not the Kauffman networks as they are defined above. 
The aggregate of automata has as a state of a node a fc-dimensional vector of independent 
output signals transmitted each by another output link. It also has fixed K = k for all nodes 
of network. This type of network has a secondary meaning - some simple examples (like Iw 
and Ix networks, Ch.3.3) do not simply work in the Kauffman mode; the coefficient of damage 
propagation has for aggregate of automata simple intuitive meaning (Ch.2.2.1). I have made 
the first investigation of structural tendencies using such simple network parameters and 
they gave strong effects. For the Kauffman networks this effect is weaker and comparison 
to aggregate of automata with the same parameters can indicate causes of observed effects. 
Structural tendencies are the main goal of my approach. They model regularities of ontogeny 
evolution observed in classical evolutionary biology such as Weismann's 'terminal additions', 
Naef's 'terminal modifications' or the most controversial - Haeckel's recapitulation. These 
tendencies are also typically detected in any complex human activity like computer 
programming, technical projects or maintenance. Knowledge of their rules should give 
important prediction. Structural tendencies, however, occur in complex systems, but the 
term 'complex' is wide and vague with a lot of different meanings. Complexity needed for 
structural tendencies is connected to the chaos phenomena, therefore when investigating their 
mechanisms, chaotic systems should be well known. I investigate them using simulation of 
different network types in the range of RSN. In this article, simulation of ten network types 
will be discussed. For such a number of network types short names and a system for arranging 
them are needed. Therefore, I do not repeat in each name 'RSN', but I use two letters for 
network type name. In the Figures where there is limited space, I use only one second letter. 
The general type of aggregate of automata is indicated as aa, its versions without feedbacks: 
genelal - an, extremely ordered in levels of fixed node number - Iw and Ix. 
Similar to aa network but following Kauffman's rule (one output signal but fixed K = k) is 
named ak. For the old classical Erdos & Renyi (1960) pattern used in RBN (CRBN) 'er' is 
used. Note, in range of RSN it must not be a Boolean network. For scale-free network (BA - 
Barabasi-Albert (Barabasi et al., 1999; 2003)) I use 'sf . It corresponds to SFRBN. Single-scale 
(Albert & Barabasi, 2002) corresponding to EFRBN, I denote as 'ss'. For all simulated networks 
I use fixed K which in addition differentiate these two types from SFRBN and EFRBN. 
The main structural tendencies need removing of nodes; only addition is insufficient. But 
for sf and ss network types removing includes a significant new feature of the network - 
it generates k = for some nodes. Such networks are different than the typical sf and ss 
because removals change node degree distribution. Therefore networks built with a 30% of 
removals of nodes and 70% of additions get other names - sh for modified sf and si for ss 
with removals. In simulations of structural tendencies Gecow (2008; 2009a) I use parameter of 



290 



Chaotic Systems 



removal participation instead. A problem of significant change of distribution of node degree 
emerges which leads to some modification of growth pattern of sf network in different ways 
(Gecow, 2009b) with different network names - se and sg. As can be seen, a network type 
should be treated as parameter with a lot of particular values (denoted by two-letter name). 
This parameter covers different other parameters used sporadically in different options. 
Damage investigation in dependency on network size N has two stages: construction of the 
network and damage investigation in the constant network. Construction of the network 
depends on the chosen network type. Except the type 'er', all networks have a rule of growth. 
Aggregate of automata 'aa' and Kauffman network 'ak' need to draw K links in order to add 
a new node (links g and h for K = 2 in Fig.2 on the left). These links are broken and their 
beginning parts become inputs to the new node and their ending parts become its outputs. 
For all types whose name starts with V (sf, sh, ss and si denoted later as s?) we draw first one 
link (g in Fig.2 on the right) and we break it like for: aa and ak to define one output and input. 
For sf and sh types at least one such output is necessary to participate in further network 
growth. Later, the remaining inputs are drawn according to the rules described above: for ss 
and si by directly drawing the node (B in Fig.2 on the right); for sf and sh by drawing a link 
(h in Fig.2 on the right) and using its source node (B in Fig.2 on the right). 




h for sf & sh 



for ss & si 



Fig. 2. Changeability patterns for aa and ak (left), sh,sf,si and ss network (right) depicted for 
K = 2. For addition of a new node to the network, links g and h are drawn. Node B is drawn 
instead of link h for ss and si. For K > 2 additional inputs are constructed like the ones on the 
right. The ak network is maintained as aa but there is only one, common output signal c. For 
removal of node, only a drawing of the node to remove is needed. Main moves are the same 
as for addition, but in an opposite sequence, however, for s?, events which occur after the 
addition change the situation. Removal can create k = 0: node Z added on link /' can remain 
a k = node while removing node C because part of link i from Z to removed C disappears. 
The outgoing links x, y, which were added to C after adding this node to the network, are 
moved to node A where link g starts. This lack of symmetry causes changes in distributions 
P(k) and other features of a network. For this reason, networks sf and ss with removals of 
node are different than without removal of node and are named sh and si respectively. 

Random removal of a node needs to draw a node only. Each node should have equal 
probability to be chosen. The pattern of node disconnection should be the same but in the 
opposite direction to connection while adding. However, if removing happens not directly 
after addition, the situation can change and such a simple assumption will be insufficient. 
Such a case appears for s? networks when k of the removed node can be (k > 1, x, y links 
in Fig.2 right) different than just after addition (k = 1) and interestingly, when on the right 
input link a new node (Z in Fig.2 right) was added. During the removal (of C node), this new 
(Z) node loses its output link and may become a k = node. Nodes with k = and other 
nodes connected to them, which have not further way for their output signals (e.g. to external 



Emergence of Matured Chaos During, Network Growth, 

Place for Adaptive Evolution and More of Equally Probable Signal Variants as an Alternative... 291 

outputs) are called 'blind' nodes. The existence of 'blind' nodes in the network is one of the 
biggest and the most interesting problems especially for the modelling of adaptation. The 
importance and complexity of this problem is similar to the problem of feedbacks. 

1.3.4 Connection to environment: L damaged of m outputs 

Following ref. (Kauffman, 1993) the size of damage i) Â£ (0, 1) is measured as the fraction of 
nodes with damaged output state in the all nodes of system. Serra et al. (2004) measure size 
of damage in number of damaged nodes and call such parameter the 'Avalanche', see Fig. 7. 
However, this parameter is usually hard to observe for real systems (Hughes et al. (2000) 
done it, see Ch.1.2.5). The adaptation process concerns interactions between the system and its 
environment. If such a process is to be described, then damage should be observed outside the 
system, on its external outputs. However, network with outputs is no longer an autonomous 
network like the ones considered from Ref. (Kauffman, 1969) up to (Iguchi et al., 2007) and 
(Serra et al., 2010). Some links are special as they are connected to environment. Environment 
is another, special 'node' which does not transmit damage (in the first approximation), unlike 
all the remaining ones. Damage fades out on the outputs like on a node with k = 0. This is 
why the dynamics of damage d should be a little bit different depending on the proportion 
of output size m and network size N (compare sf 3,4 in Fig7). Environment as an objectively 
special node can be used for the indication of the nodes' place in a network, which without 
such special node generally have no objective point of reference. The main task of this special 
node in the adaptation process is a fitness calculation and Darwinian elimination of some 
network changes. 

The simplest definition of damage size on system outputs is: the number L of damaged output 
signals. For large networks with feedbacks it is applicable using only a simplified algorithm 
described in Ch.3.1, and e.g. Ref. (Gecow, 2010). It omits the problem of circular attractors. 
Formally, L is a Hamming distance of system output signal vectors between a control system 
and a damaged one. Practically, using my algorithm, it is the distance between system output 
before and after damage simulation. For simulations, the system has a fixed number m = 64 
of output signals which means that L Â£ (0, m). We can expect, that distributions P(d) and 
P(L) will be similar. In fact, asymptotic values (for 'matured systems'): dmx of d and Lmx of 
L are simply connected: dmx = Lmx/m. But such a connection is not true for smaller systems 
and L is smaller than expected. Note, that the number of output signals m is constant and 
much smaller than the growing number N of nodes in the network, which must influence the 
statistical parameters and their precision. 

2. RSN - More of equally probable signal variants as alternative to bias p 

RSN is not a version of a known network type or a second approximation describing the same 
phenomena. Although RSN can be formally treated as a version of RNS (see Ch.1.3.2) with 
bias p equal to the probability of the remaining signal variants. It is an important, overlooked, 
simple and basic case of described reality, competitive to bias p and to the not so simple RWN 
formula. As will be shown, RSN leads to different results than when using bias p. Bias p has 
been used for all cases up till now. 

2.1 Why more equally probable signal variants should be considered 
2.1.1 Boolean networks are not generally adequate 

It is commonly assumed, that Boolean networks are always adequate in any case. A simple 
example (Fig.3) shows that this is false and it leads to wrong effects, especially for statistical

Fig. 3. Thermostat of fridge described using Kauffman networks as an example of regulation 
based on negative feedbacks and the inadequateness of the Boolean networks. Case (2) 
describes thermostat just as it is in reality - temperature T is split into three sections a - too 
cold, b - accurate, c - too hot, but this case is not then Boolean. To hold signal in Boolean range 
we can neglect temperature state b - case (1) or split node T into two nodes with separate 
states - case (3) which together describe all temperature states, but using this way a dummy 
variant (a + c) of temperature state is introduced. Node V decides power for aggregate: v - 
on, - off. Tables of functions for nodes and for consecutive system states are attached. 

expectation. Normally, more than two signal variants are needed for an adequate description. 
If a fridge leaves the proper temperature range b as a result of environment influence and 
enters too high a temperature in the range c, then power supply for the aggregate is turned on 
and temperature inside the fridge goes down. It passes range b and reaches the too-cold range 
a, then power is turned off and the temperature slowly grows through b section. Case (2) in 
Fig.3 this regulation mechanism is properly described in Kauffman network terms. However, 
there are three states of temperature a, b, c which are described by three variants of node T and 
therefore, this case of the Kauffman network is not a Boolean network. 

To hold signal describing temperature in Boolean range (two variants only) we can neglect 
temperature state b. This is case (1) but here, the most important, proper temperature state, 
which is the state the fridge stays in most of the time, is missing. Almost any time we check the 
state of a real fridge this state is not present in such a description. Reading such a description 
we find that wrong temperature a; meaning too cold occurs directly after wrong temperature 
c; too hot and vice versa. Splitting node T into two nodes Tl and T2 with separate states - 
case (3) is the second method to hold Boolean signals. Two separate Boolean signals together 
create four variants but temperature takes only three of them. A new dummy state emerges: 
a - too cold and c - too hot simultaneously. It has no sense and never appears in reality but a 
function should be defined for such a state. In the Table, the functions values for such dummy 
input state are marked by red. For statistical investigation, it is taken as a real proper state. 
Such groundless procedure produces incorrect results. 

Cases (1) and (3) describe reality inadequately. It is because Boolean networks are not 
generally adequate. We can describe everything we need using Boolean networks but in many 
cases we will introduce dummy states or we will simplify something which we do not want 
to simplify. In both cases the statistical investigation will be false. The only way is to use a 
real number of signal variants and not limit ourselves to only two Boolean alternatives. 

2.1.2 Two variants are often subjective 

Two alternatives used in Boolean networks may be an effect of two different situations: first 
- there are really two alternatives and they have different or similar probabilities; and second 



Emergence of Matured Chaos During, Network Growth, 

Place for Adaptive Evolution and More of Equally Probable Signal Variants as an Alternative... 293 

- there are lots of real alternatives, but we are watching one of them and all the remaining 
we collect into the second one (as is done for IT and T2 in Fig. 3). If in this second case, all 
of real alternatives have similar probability, then the watched one has this small probability 
which is usually described using bias p. The collection of the remaining ones then, have large 
probability. Characteristically, the watched alternative event is 'the important event' as far as 
systems which adapt are concerned. Note 1: such adapting systems are normally investigated. 
Note 2: for system which adapt, the notions: 'important', 'proper' and 'correct' are defined 
using fitness but it has nothing to do with the statistical mechanism and such simplification 
remains subjective. This is the main, yet simple and important cause of introducing more than 
two alternatives. It is used to be objective and obtain adequate results 

If the long process leading from gene mutations to certain properties assessed directly 
using fitness has to be described, then more than two signal alternatives seem much 
more adequate. It should be remarked that there are 4 nucleotides, 20 amino acids 
(similarly probable in the first approximation) and other unclear spectra of similarly 
probable alternatives. In this set of the spectra of alternatives, the case of as few as 
two alternatives seems to be an exception, however, for gene regulatory network it seems 
to be adequate in the first approximation (active or inactive gene). Investigators of 
real gene networks suggest: "While the segment polarity gene network was successfully 
modelled by a simple synchronous binary Boolean model, other networks might require 
more detailed models incorporating asynchronous updating and/or multi-level variables 
(especially relevant for systems incorporating long-range diffusion). "(Albert & Othmer, 2003) 
In second approximations which are RNS (Luque & Sole, 1997; Sole et al., 2000) and RWN 
(Ballesteros & Luque, 2005; Luque & Ballesteros, 2004), more than two variants are used but 
in a different way than here (RSN). 

2.1.3 Equal probability of signal variants as typical approximation 

For a first approximation using equal probability of alternatives from the set of possibilities 
is a typical method and a simplification necessary for prediction and calculation. In this way 
we obtain s (which can be more than two) equally probable signal variants (s > 2) (Gecow, 
1975; Gecow & Hoffman, 1983; Gecow et al, 2005; Gecow, 2008; 2010). This is a similar 
simplification as collections of remaining alternatives to one signal variant, but seems to be 
less different to the usually described real cases. 

2.2 Differences of results for descriptions using bias p and s > 2 

At this point an important example should be shown which leads to very different results for 
the above two basic variants of description - the old using bias p and my new using s. I do 
not suggest that using bias p is always an incorrect description but that for the meaning part 
of the cases it is a very wrong simplification and other ones with s > 2 should be used. 

2.2.1 w* describes the first critical period of damage spreading and simply shows that case 
s = 2 is extreme 

Returning to coefficient of damage propagation introduced in Ch.1.2.2 I now define it using s 
and K. This is w = (fc) (s â l)/s . It can be treated as damage multiplication coefficient on one 
element of system if only one input signal is changed, w indicates how many output signals 
of a node will be changed on the average (for the random function used by nodes to calculate 
outputs from the inputs). (I assume minimal P - internal homogeneity (Kauffman, 1993) in this 
whole paper and approach.) I have introduced it in Refs. (Gecow, 1975; Gecow & Hoffman, 



294 Chaotic Systems 

1983; Gecow, 2005a) as a simple intuitive indicator of the ability of damage to explode (rate of 
change propagation) which can be treated as a chaos-order indicator. 

Coefficient w is interesting for the whole network or for part of the network, not for a single 
particular node. However, it is easier to discuss it on a single, average node. Therefore I have 
started my approach using aggregate of automata (Gecow, 1975; Gecow & Hoffman, 1983; 
Gecow et al., 2005) (Chi. 3. 3 - aa, Fig.2) where K = k and each outgoing link of node has its 
own signal. It differs to Kauffman network where all outgoing links transmit the same signal. 
In this paper I consider networks with fixed K and (k) = K, i.e. all nodes in the particular 
network have the same number of inputs. If so, I can write w = K(s â l)/s. 
If w > 1 then the damage should statistically grow and spread onto a large part of a system. 
It is similar to the coefficient of neutron multiplication in a nuclear chain reaction. It is less 
than one in a nuclear power station, for values greater than one an atomic bomb explodes. 
Note that w = 1 appears only if K = 2 and s = 2. Both these parameters appear here in their 
smallest, extreme values. The case k < 2 is sensible for a particular node but not as an average 
in a whole, typical, randomly built network, however, it is possible to find the case K = 1 in 
Fig.3.1 and Fig.4 or in Refs. (Iguchi et al., 2007; Kauffman, 1993; Wagner, 2001). For all other 
cases where s > 2 or K > 2 it is w > 1. 

In the Ref. (Aldana et al., 2003) similar equation (6.2): K c (s â 1) /s = 1 is given which is a case 
for the condition w = 1. K c is a critical connectivity between an ordered and chaotic phase. 
They state: "The critical connectivity decreases monotonically when s > 2, approaching 1 as 
s â > oo The moral is that for this kind of multi-state networks to be in the ordered phase, 
the connectivity has to be very small, contrary to what is observed in real genetic networks." 
However, as I am going to show in this paper, that the assumption that such networks should 
be in ordered phase is false. 

The critical connectivity was searched by Derrida & Pomeau (1986) and they found for bias p 
that 2K c p(l - p) = 1. (See also (Aldana, 2003; Fronczak et al., 2008). Shmulevich et al. (2005) 
use 'expected network sensitivity' defined as 2Kp(l â p) which Ramo et al. (2006) call the 
'order parameter'. Serra et al. (2007) use (4.9) (k)q where c\ is the probability that node change 
its state if one of its inputs is changed. This value "coincides with 'Derrida exponent' which 
has been often used to characterize the dynamics of RBN".) The meaning of these equations is 
similar to that above (6.2) equation in the (Aldana et al., 2003). See Fig. 4. But putting p = 1/s 
it takes the form: 2K c (s â 1) /s = 1 which only for s = 2 is the same as above. 
For coefficient W it is assumed that only one input signal is damaged. This assumption is valid 
in a large network, only at the beginning of damage spreading. But this period is crucial for 
the choice: a small initiation either converts into a large avalanche or it does not - damage 
fades out at the beginning. In this period each time step damage is multiplied by w and if 
w > 1, then it grows quickly. When damage becomes so large that probability of more than 
one damaged input signal is meaning, then already the choice of large avalanche was done 
(i.e. early fade out of damage is practically impossible). See Fig. 5. in Ch 2.2.3. 

2.2.2 Area of order 

For s > 2 (and K > 2) damage should statistically always grow if it does not fade out at the 
beginning when fluctuations work on a small number of damaged signals, and whenever it 
has room to grow. That damage should statistically always grow is shown in my 'coefficient 
of damage propagation', and chaos should always be obtained. Only case s = 2, K = 2 is an 
exception. However, (see Fig. 4) if we take a particular case with larger s (e.g. 6) and small 
K > 2 (e.g. K = 3), and we use the old description based on bias p, then we obtain an extreme

Fig. 4. Values of coefficient of damage propagation w s for s and K and phase transition 
between order and chaos also for bias p. If the case where s equally probable variants is 
described using the bias p method ( s â 1 variants as the second Boolean signal variant), then 
instead the lower diagram, the upper one is used, but it is very different. 

bias p = 1/6 for which order is expected (upper diagram in Fig. 4). In the lower diagram 
the coefficient w is shown for description case with all signal variants, but for simplicity they 
are taken as equally probable. These two dependences are very different, but for s = 2 they 
give identical predictions. This means, that we cannot substitute more than two similarly 
probable signal variants for an 'interesting' one and all remaining as a second one and use 
'bias p description', because it leads to an incorrect conclusion. 

In RNS signal variants are not equally probable. In RNS bias p plays an important role 
allowing investigation of phase transition to chaos as in the whole Kauffman approach. It is 
not a mechanism which substitutes bias p, although using p = 1/s the RNS formally contains 
my RSN. Typically the case of more than two variants which is taken as interpretatively better 
(Aldana et al., 2003), is rejected (Aldana et al., 2003) (see above Ch.2.2.1) or not developed as 
contradictory with the expectation of 'life at the edge of chaos' which I question here. 

2.2.3 Damage equilibrium levels for s > 2 are significantly higher 

Dependences of new damage size on current damage size after the one synchronous time 
step depicted in Fig. 5 on the right, are calculated in a theoretical way based on annealed 
approximation (Derrida & Pomeau, 1986) described in Kauffman (1993) book (p. 199 and 
Fig.5.8 for s = 2). Such a diagram is known as 'Derrida plot', here it is expanded to case 
s > 2 and for aa - aggregate of automata. 

If a denotes a part of damaged system B with the same states of nodes as an undisturbed 
system A, then a K is the probability that the node has all its K inputs with the same signals in 
both systems. Such nodes will have the same state in the next time point t + 1. The remaining 
1 â a part of nodes will have a random state, which will be the same as in system A with 
probability 1/s. The part of system B which does not differ with A in t + 1 is therefore 



296

a K + (1 - a K )/s. It is the same as for RNS (Sole et al., 2000). The damage d = 1 - a. For 
K = 2 we obtain di = wd\ â wd^/2 where for small d\ we can neglect the second element. 
For aggregate of automata (aa) if K = 2 then di = d\ *w â di * (s â l) 2 /(s + l)/s which is 
obtained in a similar way as the above. Here also for small d\ we can neglect element with d^ 
which allows us to use simple w f for the first crucial period of damage spreading. 




Fig. 5. Theoretical damage spreading calculated using an annealed approximation. On the 
right - damage change at one time step in synchronous calculation known as the 'Derrida 
plot', extended for the case s > 2 and for aa network type. The crossing of curves 
d t+ i (df, s,K) with line d t+ \ = dt shows equilibrium levels dmx up to which damage can 
grow. Case s,K = 2,2 has a damage equilibrium level in d = 0. These levels are reached on 
the left which shows damage size in time dependency. For s > 2 they are significantly higher 
than for Boolean networks and for aa than for the Kauffman network. All cases with the 
same K have the same colour to show s influence. A simplified expectation d(t) = dgiu t using 
coefficient w is shown (three short curves to the left of the longer reaching equilibrium). This 
approximation is good for the first critical period when d is still small. 

These figures show that the level of damage equilibrium for aggregate of automata is much 
higher than for the Kauffman networks. To expect fl fln/ f+i - the part of the nodes in aa network 
which does not differ at t + 1 in systems A and B, we can use expectation for the Kauffman 
networks shown above. Such 0-Kauff,l+l describes signals on links of aa, not the node states of

2.3 Importance of parameter s from simulation 

The results of simulations show other important influences of parameter s, especially for its 
lower values, on the behaviour of different network types. The annealed approximation does 
not see those phenomena. It is shown in Fig. 6. However, to understand this result I should 
first describe model and its interpretation. The puzzles of such a complex view of a complex 
system are not a linear chain but, as a described system, a non-linear network with a lot of 
feedbacks resembling tautology. Therefore, some credit for a later explanation is needed. For 
now it can build helpful intuition for a later description. 

To describe Fig. 6 1 must start from Fig. 7 which is later discussed in detail. Now, please focus on 
the right distributions in first row of Fig. 7. It is P(d\N) for autonomous sf network type with 
s, K = 3, 4. It is the usual view of damage size distribution when a network grows, here from 
N = 50 to N = 4000. What is important? - That for larger N there are two peaks and a deep 
pass between them, which reaches zero frequency (blue bye) and therefore clearly separates 
events belonging to particular peaks. These two peaks have different interpretations. The 



Emergence of Matured Chaos During, Network Growth, 

Place for Adaptive Evolution and More of Equally Probable Signal Variants as an Alternative... 297 

right peak, under which there is a black line, contains cases of large avalanches which reach 
equilibrium level (as annealed model expects) and never fade out. Size of damage can be 
understand as the effect of its measure in lots of particular points during its fluctuation 
around equilibrium level. It is chaotic behaviour. The left peak is depicted on the left in A 
- number of damaged nodes, i.e. 'Avalanche'(Serra et al., 2004), because in this parameter it is 
approximately constant. It contains cases of damage initiation after which damage spreading 
really fades out. But because initiation is a permanent change (in interpretation, see Ch.3.1), 
a certain set of damaged nodes remains and this is a damage size, which is small. This is 
an ordered behaviour. Autonomous case was investigated in simulation described in Fig. 6 
and by the Kauffman approach. In Fig. 6 the fractions of ordered (r) and chaotic (c) cases are 
depicted. Together, they are all cases of damage initiation (r + c = 1). Parameters r and c have 
an important interpretation: r is a 'degree of order' , and c is a degree of chaos of a network. 
Real fadeout described by r only occurs in a random way which does not consider negative 
feedbacks collected by adaptive evolution of living systems. Assuming essential variable fixed 
we can move effects of negative feedbacks into left peak and add them into r. 
For comparison I choose five cases described as s, K: 2,3; 2,4; 3,2; 4,2; 4,3 for the five network 
types: er, ss, sf, ak, aa. In this set there are: K = 3 and K = 4 for s = 2, next: s = 3 and s = 4 for 
K = 2. Similarly for K = 3 and s = 4 the second parameter has two variants. The coefficient w 
is the smallest for case 3,2 (w = 1.33) and the largest in the shown set for 4,3 (iv = 2.25). Cases 
2,3 and 4,2 have the same w = 1.5 and for er they have the same value r. 

Each simulation consists of 600 000 damage initiations in 100 different networks which grow 
randomly up to a particular N. After that each node output state was changed 3 times (2 
times). Types of fadeout (real or pseudo) were separated using threshold d = 250/ N where 
zero frequency is clear for all cases. The shown in Fig. 6 results have 3 decimal digits of 
precision, therefore the visible differences are not statistical fluctuations. Simulations were 
made for N = 2000 and N = 3000 nodes in the networks but result are practically the same. 
As can be seen, using higher s = 4 for K = 2 causes damage spreading to behave differently 
than for s = 2 and K = 3, despite the same value of coefficient w = 1.5, except for er network 
type. Therefore, both these parameters cannot substitute for each other, i.e. we cannot limit 
ourselves to one of them or to the coefficient w. In the Kauffman approach, chaotic regime 
was investigated mainly for two equally probable signal variants, i.e. s = 2 and different K 
parameter only, but dimension of s is also not trivial and different than dimension K. 
The ss and ak networks exhibit symmetrical dependency in s and K but for the most interesting 
sf and er network types there is no symmetry (see (Gecow, 2009)). For sf the dependency on 
s is stronger but for er it is weaker than the dependency on K. These differences are not big 
but may be important. The scale-free network, due to the concentration of many links in 
a few hubs, has a much lower local coefficient of damage spreading w for most of its area 
than coefficient for the whole network. The significantly lower damage size for sf network is 
known (Crucitti et al., 2004; Gallos et al., 2004) as the higher tolerance of a scale-free network of 
attack. Also Iguchi et al. (2007) state: "It is important to note that the SFRBN is more ordered 
than the RBN compared with the cases with K = (k)" . The er network, however, contains 
blind nodes of k = which are the main cause for the different behaviour of this network 
type. Networks types create directed axis used in Fig. 6 where degrees of order and chaos are 
monotonic except K = 2 for er. 

Ending agitation for s > 2 1 would like to warn that the assumption of two variants is also used 
in a wide range of similar models e.g. cellular automata, Ising model or spin glasses (Jan & 
Arcangelis, 1994). It is typically applied as a safe, useful simplification which should be used

of precision. Cases of parameters s and K are selected for easy comparison. Note that for 
s,K = 4,2 and 2,3 the coefficient w = 1.5. 

for preliminary recognition. But, just as in the case of Boolean networks, this assumption may 
not be so safe and should be checked carefully. In the original application of Ising model and 
spin glasses to physical spin it is obviously correct, but these models are nowadays applied to 
a wide range of problems, from social (e.g. opinion formation) to biological ones, where such 
an assumption is typically a simplification. 



3. Emergence of matured chaos during network growth 

3.1 Model of a complex system, its interpretation and algorithm 
3.1.1 Tasks of the model 

This model is performed to capture the mechanisms leading to the emergence of regularities 
of ontogeny evolution observed in old, classical evolutionary biology. For example, 'terminal 
addition' which means that ontogeny changes accepted by evolution typically are an addition 
of new transformation which takes place close to the end of ontogeny, i.e. in the form 
similar to adult. (Ontogeny is a process of body development from zygote to adult form.) 
'Terminal modification' is a second such regularity, typically taken as competitive to first 
one. It states, that additions and removals of transformation are equally probable, but these 
changes happen much more frequently in later stages. I define such regularities as 'structural 
tendencies' which are the by-product of adaptive conditions during adaptive evolution of 
complex networks. Structural tendencies are differences between changeability distribution 
before and after elimination of non-adaptive changes. Structural tendencies are easily visible 
in human activity as well. This is wide and important theme. 

This main task of a model indicates the range and scale of the modelled process. It is 
not a system answer for particular stimuli that will be modelled, but a statistical effect of 
adaptive changes of a large general functioning network over a very long time period. Maybe, 
mathematical methods can be implemented, but the preferred method for such a non-linear 
model is a computer simulation which to be real, model and algorithm must be strongly 
simplified. As was described in Ch.1.2 typical behaviour of network activity is looping in 
circular attractor. This view was developed for autonomous networks, i.e. without links from- 
and to the external environment. However, interaction with the environment is intensive for 



Emergence of Matured Chaos During, Network Growth, 

Place for Adaptive Evolution and More of Equally Probable Signal Variants as an Alternative... 299 

living systems, crucial for adaptive evolution mechanism, and very complex. It includes two 
main elements which in first approximation can be separated. The first is: influence of the 
environment on network function which can be described using external inputs of network. 
The second is: elimination based on network features which can be described using external 
output signals of network (through define fitness). Fitness is actually an effect of a large 
number of events where a particular environment sends particular stimuli, and the system 
answers on the stimuli. In the effect of such a long conversation, large avalanche of damage 
in the system happens or does not happen. Many such events and similar systems, after 
averaging, define fitness. This whole process can be omitted using similarity of network 
output to arbitrary defined requirements. But this method is easy to do in simple models 
where such particular output exists. Even if environment is constant, circular attractors 
instead are expected. Constant environment may describe statistically stable environment 
over a long time period. In this period the stable function of a system with a particular 
output signal vector should be described (for the fitness definition). Evolutionary change 
of network structure changes network function and gives new fitness. This fitness is used to 
decide whether this change should be accepted or eliminated. 

3.1.2 Starting model of a stably functioning system without feedbacks 

To obtain such a description of stable function of system which can give correct statistical 
results it is easier to start from the simple case of network without feedbacks. This starting 
model is lack of simplifications and has simple interpretation. Later, when feedbacks will 
be added, some necessary simplifications, or a neglecting of the interpretational restrictions 
which do not change the results, will be introduced. 

Let each node-state of this network equal the value of the current signals function on the node 
inputs. It is not a typical system state - in the next time step (e.g. in the synchronous mode) 
nothing will be changed. Now a disturbance which permanently changes (change remains 
constant) one node function is introduced and this node is calculated. To obtain a new stable 
state of the system function, only nodes with at least one input signal which had changed 
(as a result of damage) are calculated. For this calculation the old signals on the remaining 
inputs can be used if for a given node they do not depend on the remaining nodes waiting for 
calculation. Such a node will always exist because a node does not depend on itself (above it is 
assumed that the network is without feedbacks). After a finite number of node calculations the 
process of damage spreading will stop (fade out) - it reaches outputs of the network or 'blind 
nodes' without outputs or it simple fades out. Now all the node states are again equal to the 
function value of the current node inputs as was the case at the beginning. However, despite 
this fade out of damage spreading, lots of node states are different than at the beginning, i.e. - 
damaged. Only the size of damage is important here. The damaged part of the network is a 
clear tree which grows inside the 'cone of influence' of the first damaged node (Fig.9 Ch.3.3.1) 
It is necessary to emphasize that the dynamical process of damage spreading really fades out 
- i.e. in the next time steps there are no new nodes whose states become different than in a 
not disturbed system. But in effect, the nodes which function in other ways remain in the 
new stably functioning system because initiating change is permanent. To control damage 
spreading only the disturbed system and only nodes with damaged input are calculated. 
This paper is limited to damage spreading; I will not use fitness and discuss adaptive 
evolution. For statistical investigation of damage size, particular functions do not need to 
be used. Therefore, it is not necessary to check a dependency, and a waiting; node in any 
sequence can be calculated, i.e. its new state can be drawn. In such a case, the assumption 



300 Chaotic Systems 

that all node states are equal to the value of the function of the current input signal is not 
necessary. 

3.1.3 Including feedbacks 

The process of damage spreading must fade out, because there are no feedbacks, although 
feedbacks are usual in modelled systems and cannot be neglected. In the case of feedbacks, 
sometimes an already calculated node gets a damaged input signal for a second time. For 
measuring the statistical damage size only, it is not necessary to examine its initiation for 
the second time. If such a second initiation will be processed, then the process virtually 
never stops. In one large simulated network there are a few decades of such feedbacks with 
lots of common points and probability, then all of them will simultaneously fade out when 
coefficient w > 1 is very small. Therefore, damage can really fade out only in the first few 
steps, when the probability that the loop of feedback is reached and closes is still very small. 
'Loop closes' means that some already calculated (damaged) nodes get damaged input the 
second time. Because the already calculated node is not calculated a second time, then damage 
must also fade out. But it is 'pseudo fade out' which substitutes infinite damage spreading on 
an equilibrium level. Obtained damage size is statistically identical to distribution of damage 
size checked in lots of points when damage size fluctuates around equilibrium level. 
Such assumptions of model, define simple and useful algorithm described in Ref.(Gecow, 
2010) which I use in my investigation. Existence of damage initiation cases with effective 
middle damage size is a limitation of parameters of this model. In these cases it is not clear 
if there is pseudo- or real fade out. In such a range of network parameters, the result may be 
not exact. It is more or less exact depending on fraction of the middle damage cases. This 
model and algorithm are therefore prepared for chaotic networks where they are exact. As 
was mentioned in Ch.2.3 and will be discussed below, on chaotic area the cases of real- and 
pseudo fade out are clearly separated in two peaks of damage size distribution. 

3.2 Simulation of networks growth and damage spreading 

In opposition to Kauffman's approach and simulation described above in Ch.2.3, now I 
examine networks with external outputs and inputs. For all simulation I assume m = 64 
external output signals which are watched for damage and the same number of input signals 
which are constant. Therefore networks are not autonomous but similar. The main task of this 
experiment is to get a view of how chaos emerges during network growth and when it can be 
treated as matured. This task can be translated to obtain and analyse distributions of damage 
size inside different networks and on their outputs in a large range of network sizes and for 
other different parameters like type, s, K. 

This theme was interesting because structural tendencies clearly occur in a range of 'complex' 
networks. Such complexity was connected to clear separation of right peak from the left 
one in damage size distribution. These dependency was observed from the beginning of 
the structural tendencies investigation. Similar in effects three criterion of such 'complexity' 
threshold are shown in (Gecow, 2008) in Table 1. I.e. 90% of dmx (equilibrium level, see Fig. 5), 
80% of Lmx and zero occurrence in frequency between peaks even for large statistics. These 
investigations, however, were a first. Much wider data are analysed in (Gecow, 2009) in Fig. 10 
(unfortunately, not with the latest version of the description). The upper diagrams (10.1 and 
10.2) show the position of the right peak maximum in P(d) distribution in dependency on N 
up till 4000, and the lower ones (10.3 and 10.4) analogue for P(L). In the left diagrams (10.1 
and 10.3) all 5 network types (s/, ss, er, ak, ad) are shown for s, K = 4, 2 but for right diagrams, 



Emergence of Matured Chaos During, Network Growth, 

Place for Adaptive Evolution and More of Equally Probable Signal Variants as an Alternative... 301 

only extreme sf and ak for s = 4, 16, 64 with K = 2 and only K = 3 with s = 4. In the 
effect the previous suggestion of very similar results of the above three criterions has not been 
confirmed. Therefore, in (Gecow, 2010a) a simulation experiment investigating the whole 
interesting range of parameters was performed. As in Fig.7 is shown, criterions based on 
distance to dmx or Lmx are an effect of existence in the network special node - 'environment' 
and its parameter m, but it is an important element of described reality, e.g. living systems. 

3.2.1 Description of the experiment 

Fig.7 shows the main results of simulations: distributions P(d\N) of damage size d (a 
fraction of all N nodes which have different state than in the non-disturbed network); and 
distributions P(L\N) damage size of network external output signals in number of damaged 
signals L. Each of these distributions are shown for 20 particular points of N = 50, 70, 100, 
130, 160, 200, 240, 300, 400, 500, 600, 800, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1600, 2000, 2400, 3000, 4000 shown 
in log-scale. In Fig.7, only three cases of network types and their particular parameters s and 
K are shown but all combinations of 7 network types (sh, sf, si, ss, er, ak, aa), s = 2,3, 4, 16 and 
K = 2, 3, 4 except cases s,K = 2,2 and 16,4 were simulated. This is together 7 * (4 * 3 â 2) = 70 
cases(Gecow, 2010a). As in Ref. (Gecow, 2010;a) these parameters are denoted in the form: 
two (or one, second only) letters of network type, followed by s and K parameters in number 
separated by a comma. 

Networks grow during the simulation (except er which is drawn each time). At the particular 
levels of N damage is simulated as in Ch.2.3 where all remaining variants of state of each 
node are used in turn as damage initiation. When they all are used, the network grows to 
the next level of N. Results of a few networks with the same parameters are summarised. 
For each level of N the same number of events is assumed (near 300 thousands, for s? 2,3 
- 800 000), therefore for larger N less networks are sufficient. When s=16, then there are 15 
remaining states and to obtain 300 000 events for a network containing N=4000 nodes it is 
enough to build 5 networks. As it will be shown later, it is a relatively small number and a 
large but interesting fluctuation was obtained (see Ch.3.2.3 and Fig. 8). Distribution P(d\N) 
has a discrete number of points, it is N. For all N in Fig.7 there are a fixed 200 points used to 
make comparison available, but such an operation must cause some visible discontinuities in 
the beginning of the first, left peak. 

In Fig.7 only 3 cases are shown, but they depict all the basic phenomena well. One 
autonomous case is added for comparison. This is the main view of the evolution process 
of distribution of damage size d and L during network growth. In the details of this process 
a threshold of matured chaos is searched for. In the plane parallel to the paper, a distribution 
P(d) or P(L) is shown for the particular network size N. N grows depicted in logarithmic 
scale in depth behind the paper. For non-zero values of P (as frequency obtained as simulation 
results) red colour is used, for zero value - blue. The vertical lines are blue if both connected 
values of frequency (P) are zero and green otherwise. This useful method easily depicts the 
dynamics of chaos appearance as nice landscape with the important area of blue 'bay' where 
exact zero between peaks occurs. 

The right peak (for networks with external connections) emerges from the tail of the left peak 
in the part of small damage (for autonomous network it appears faster and near dmx). In the 
first period of network growth it moves to the right, but later it turns smoothly and its position 
becomes stable, drawing an asymptotical line (black one) to the parallel line to the N axis. It 
is a vertical projection of the maximum of right peak on 'sea level' (P = 0). These lines from 
all simulation cases are collected and analysed in details in (Gecow, 2010a). In addition, the

degree of chaos c and similarity of d and L (as L/m/d, i.e. departure of L = d * m expectation) 
are analysed. There are searched criteria of chaotic features where a small network effect can 
be neglected. The results have a short description in the next chapter. The main conclusion is 
that there is no critical point which can be used for such criterion. But matured chaos appears, 
and some threshold (but smooth and little bit different in different phenomena) objectively 
exist. In such a case, any particular criterion must contain arbitrary defined value.

Small network (N = 50) typically behaves as it does on the edge of chaos and order (near 
power law as for percolation point). This dependency approximately remains as the left peak 
in the chaotic area and there is a place for life evolution. Length of d axis is constant for 
different N, those suppresses its shape for larger N even if it is the same for the number of 
damaged nodes (see Fig. 7 'avalanche' distribution P(A\N) for autonomous network). Right 
peak emerges where black line starts. For extremely ordered sh 2,4 (the least chaotic is sh 
2,3) shown in the second row in Fig.7, right peak does not appear for P(L\N) even for 
N = 4000 but for P(d\N) it just starts to appear. For extremely chaotic network er 16,3 
right peak is present already for N = 50. (The most chaotic are ak and aa 16,3.) Between 
peaks the pass forms whose minimum goes down and reaches zero frequency (forms the blue 
bay). Note, that only where this bay appears the reversed annealed algorithm used for these 
simulations becomes surely exact. For all sections of N up to this point, the algorithm gives 
only approximate results, but they sufficiently show the qualitative properties of the growth 
process and the emergence of the chaotic features. 

3.2.2 Results 

The term 'matured chaos' in the context of network size N has two main aspects, they are: 1- 
high level of chaos; and 2- small influence of 'finite size effects'. The first one splits itself into: 
a- high value of equilibrium level of damage (influence of environment can be neglected); and 
b - high value of degree of chaos c (Ch.2.3, Fig. 6). The height of equilibrium level of damage 
(l.a) for the very large networks (infinite N), i.e. dmx and Lmx, are expected by annealed 
approximation (Ch.2.2.3, Fig.5) and depend first of all on s and secondly on K. Dependency on 
N is searched, therefore not the absolute values of dmx or Lmx, but departures of these values 
are interesting. These departures are in the range of point 2, i.e. 'finite size effects'. However, 
absolute value for particular N also influences peaks separation (2.d). Degree of chaos c (l.b) 
also have asymptotic value for infinite N for particular case of network type and parameters 
s, K. In such a case maturation of chaos is mainly a domain of aspect 2 - disappearance of finite 
size effect. In its range exist qualitative aspects of shape and clarity of separation of both peaks 
from which should be taken more measurable phenomenon - appearance of zero frequency 
(blue bay) between peaks. Its existence does not depend on connection to environment (upper 
row in Fig.7). 

Each of analysed relations seems to be dependent in a different way on the observed 
parameters in detail, but generally they give similar conclusions. Differences in these 
relations' behaviour suggest that they are at least three or four different mechanisms. Each 
of them seems to be near 'scale free' and therefore there is no critical points in them which 
means that for a particular threshold, an arbitrary value must be chosen depending on 
our intention and needs (when properties of small network can be neglected). The last 
criterion (i.e. appearance of zero frequency between peaks) seems to be the most 'correct' 
and useful. It shifts very slowly with the growth of statistics (event number). This shift needs 
more investigation. This criterion works correctly only for networks with feedbacks. For a 
network without feedbacks (which in described reality is a strange case) it can be used with 
approximation. This theme will be discussed in Ch.3.3. 

3.2.3 Two causes of dispersion, reversed-annealed simulation 

Separation level of the left and right peaks depends on the wideness of the right one but what 

are the sources of this wideness? Two of them can be expected: 

1- Necessary effects of taken parameters m for L and N for d, when it is described by a binomial

Fig. 8. Individual structure influence on the right peak width. Extreme examples of 
differences in 3 particular networks (a, b, c) on N=2400, 3000, 4000 measured two times, the 
second time after a random change of all node states, while keeping the structure stable. 
Value of shift is larger (s=16) than the width of peak which is exactly repeatable (two 
consecutive cases 1 and 2). The stable character of deviation for a particular network during 
its three steps of growth is visible, especially in the right diagram. Compare to er which 
doesn't growth. This diagram contains all the simulated cases depicted only as points of 
maximum (colour lines) and its standard deviation (black lines). 

distribution if each node or output signal has equal probability to be damaged. Such a simple 
model works too well. For L K = 2 the comparison theoretical standard deviation to the 
experimental data are in the range of error (10%) but for K = 3 and K = 4 the obtained 
standard deviation is a little bit lower than theoretical which needs correction of assumption. 
It also approximately explains well the shapes for d and ak network, however, for K < 4 
experimental standard deviations are greater than the theoretical ones; up to two times for 
s, _K=4,2. This discrepancy has unknown source, it grows for more chaotic networks and 
reaches a 4 times higher value for sh 4,2. This study of dispersion sources is only a preliminary 
investigation. 

2- Each particular network has its own particular individual structure which should cause a 
deviation from the average behaviour. Above I remark (Ch.3.2.1) that for s=16 where only 
5 networks were used for the last N=4000, large fluctuations are observed. To confirm that 
the fluctuation source is the structure, and to get a scale of this phenomenon three networks 
were simulated for N=2400, 3000 and 4000. For each N level two damage measurements 
were performed: one with node states as they were obtained during network growth and 
the second one with new random states of all nodes. Fig. 8 shows two of the most extreme 
examples (ss 16,3 and sh 16,4) of the effects of this experiment in the form of full distributions. 
All results in the form of three points of the right peak's maximum, connected by line in the 
according colour accomplished by black line showing standard deviation are also shown.

As was expected, effects of changing node states and original states are identical. This method 
resembles the annealed model Derrida & Pomeau (1986); Kauffman (1993) but reversed: in 
the original annealed model, the states are kept and the structure is changed. This is the 
source of the algorithm name: 'reversed annealed'. Please note that for these simulations it is 
not necessary to use particular functions for nodes. Such functions are used (Gecow, 2009a) 
for certain structural tendencies simulation. As can be seen in Fig. 8 in the right diagram, 
deviations are typically stable during the next levels N of network growth and the distances 
of peak maxims are larger than the standard deviation of peaks for one network. It is probably 
an effect of hubs and blind nodes as more chaotic networks (aa, ak, er) exhibit the effect in a 
much smaller way. For ss, si, sf and sh the wideness of total and individual peaks, and their 
absolute differences consecutively grow and are relatively and absolutely the biggest for sh, 
but it depend on K and s parameters. 

3.3 Explanation of two peaks 

Two separated peaks, one for real fade out and the second for pseudo fade out are an 
assumption of the simplified algorithm ('reversed annealed') used for simulation. Using this 
algorithm I investigated these two peaks and the appearance of the right one. Is it a tautology? 
No, however, in the area where the second peak emerges, this algorithm is not clear and may 
produce effects which are not exactly correct. Such effects have no clear interpretation. Thus, 
it is desirable to model this area in another way to understand why we should expect two 
peaks and why they are not present from the beginning. Percolation theory is a known theory 
which explain these two peaks. Another way for intuition for a different point of view and 
different aspects will be shown here. 

3.3.1 Extremely simple lw network and cone of influence 

A good place to begin is the extremely simple network depicted in Fig.9 upper row on the 
right. Imagine that there are 32 nodes in each level. Each node has two inputs and two 
outputs like aa network for K = 2. Nodes from one level are connected to higher level nodes 
in an extremely ordered way depicted in the figure. To eliminate boundaries on the left and 
right a cylinder is created. Network ends at the top in external outputs of network which send 
signals to the environment as a result of network function. I, however, will consider network 
outputs in a more complicated way. I name this network 'lw' - 'V because it has clear levels 
and 'w' because this letter is similar to the connection pattern. 

The lw network does not contain feedbacks, it is probably the most ordered one in the sense 
of simplicity of connection pattern which requires an extremely small amount of information 
for its description. Only for a similarly simple network can one draw on paper a 'cone of 
influence' for a given node. The cone contains in its 'later' part, all nodes which can be 
damaged if the given one (in the vertex of cone) is damaged. Outputs are the base of the cone. 
Arrows depict the direction of signal flow which means that ho is a directed and functioning 
network like all the networks of our interest (RSN) Gecow (2010). In such a case, information 
in the form of signals flows up from the bottom (if cylinders stand up); this is functional order 
(or sequence) which defines terms 'early', 'later' and 'terminal' (closely near outputs, at the 
end of signal path). A similar phenomenon named 'supremacy' is investigated in Holyst et al. 
(2004) in a more theoretical way for directed scale-free network. 

Levels can be numbered by number H (height) starting from an indicated node, however, 
nodes are similar and such a method is not stable. It can be substituted by a numbering which 
starts from the stable outputs therefore, such numbering is a depth D measure. The depth

P(L\H) - damage size distribution for consecutive levels H (if initiation was made in depth 
D = H), and P(L\N) - damage size L distribution for networks which are Hmx high (all 
depth D are equally probable, N = Hmx * 32) 

D is a useful structural substitution of the functional sequence. For a cone of influence it 
is the height of it, which indicates the number of outputs which can be reached by damage 
initialised in the vertex of the cone. Not all of the later nodes and network outputs will be 
damaged. The density of filling the cone by damage depends on the coefficient w of damage 
propagation described in Ch.2.2.1 and Ref. Gecow (2010). If W > 1 and damage does not fade 
out in the first few steps, then it also becomes a cone and is greater for greater cone height. 



3.3.2 Damage on outputs and damage path through network without feedbacks, complexity 

Next, the distribution of number L of damaged output signals in dependency on depth D will 
be examined. As an equivalent of using the depth D for the real network outputs, the sets of 
node outputs in consecutive higher levels (numbered by H) from initiation of damage can be 
watched. In Fig.9 this process is shown for s = 4. The levels are numbered with H but for 
comparison to the old known term, it can be calculated N = H * 32 which is the number of 
nodes in levels from initiation of damage. As in Fig. 7 there are two peaks, zero in-between 
and the process of emergence of the right peak, however, it does not yet correspond with Fig. 7. 



Emergence of Matured Chaos During, Network Growth, 

Place for Adaptive Evolution and More of Equally Probable Signal Variants as an Alternative... 307 

To obtain the same meaning as in Fig. 7 the height of the full network (which we can assume 
to be equal to Hmx) must be defined. Distributions from all equally probable levels (from the 
beginning to the shown one = Hmx ) must also be summarized. The result is also shown in 
Fig.9, but only for two heights Hmx of network (for Hmx,N = 10,320 for Ix or 50,1600 for 
Iw and 125,4000 for both). Now we also find two peaks, but in-between there cannot be zero 
because middle levels exist and were summarized. 

Let a part of 'order' from the description of structure be removed using random connection 
between neighbouring levels. Much more information for the description of such a particular 
network is necessary those it is more complex. I use the name 'lx' for this network (Fig.9 
lower row in the right). In the left it depicts the damage propagation for lx in consecutive 
distributions of damage size for growing distance from the initiation point as above for Iw. For 
lx the right peak reaches its stable position much faster and the transitional stages contribute 
much less to the sum between peaks, which is visible in P(L\N) (here N is used to distinguish 
P(L\H) for particular level and summarized case for all levels from initiation point to Hmx). 
When s grows, e.g. two times; from 4 to 8, then the effect is similar to an increase of complexity. 
Much more is necessary to know in order to describe such a particular network with states, 
and the right peak reaches a stable position two times faster. 

3.3.3 Damage path through network with feedbacks 

It is now necessary to discuss the network case with feedbacks. This question crops up: 
how deep is a particular place of damage initiation in such a network? This question can be 
translated into a question about the length of path from initiation point to outputs, however, 
in opposite to networks Iw and lx such paths typically are very different and the clear answer 
is not defined. They are different for two reasons. First, because clear levels used in Iw and 
lx are a strong assumption which must not be taken even for network without feedbacks, e.g. 
for an network described in Ref. Gecow (2008). The second reason is because feedbacks make 
such a measure undefined. 

Feedbacks are the loops in which signals and damage can loop many times even up to infinity 
therefore there is no longest path, but the shortest path, which is only defined, is not very 
adequate. This theme is discussed more widely in Ref. (Gecow, 2009b). In a typical randomly 
constructed network there are a lot of feedbacks, they are a cause of the equilibrium state of 
damage which should remain stable to infinity. If damage passes the first period when it is 
small and has real probability of fade out, then it reaches the feedbacks loops and its path 
through network will be infinite. It corresponds to an infinite depth of initiation, still, outputs 
may also be reached fast. Therefore in a network with feedbacks there are no middle paths 
and middle damage sizes placed between peaks. Then in this area zero frequency occurs. This 
zero means that the network is so large that feedbacks are reached quickly (after a short way, 
frequently) enough that middle ways cannot happen. 

For a network without feedbacks there remains the criterion (of matured chaos) based on the 
stable position of the right peak and for practice some arbitrary percent of asymptotical level 
should be used. A large flat area between peaks of small value of probability in comparison 
to the right peak may be taken as a good approximation of zero occurrence. 

4. Conclusion 

In comparison to the main stream of investigation of transition to chaos which concerns the 
exact 'edge of chaos' (K < 2, s = 2) on the K axis, my approach expands s dimension (more 
equally probable signal variants) and moves attention into the area known as chaotic (K > 2, 



308 Chaotic Systems 

s > 2 without the case s, K = 2, 2) and large networks. When network is small, it typically is 
not chaotic, then (matured) chaos emerges during its growth. Investigation of this emerging 
reaches much higher network sizes (N = 4000 even for s, K = 4,4 and 16,3). In this area 
another transition to 'matured' chaos and its threshold is investigated, now on the N axis 
which is another, independent dimension of searched space. 

The 'matured chaos' in context of network size N is an effect of the disappearance of finite 
size effect during network growth. Important part of causes the effect is constant special node 
- connection to environment. Three or four independent mechanisms can be seen. Each of 
them seems to be near 'scale free' and therefore there are no critical points in them which 
means that for particular threshold an arbitrary value must be chosen depending on our 
needs. Appearance of zero frequency between peaks in damage size distribution seems to 
be the most 'correct' and useful criterion of matured chaos. 

Living systems are shifted following Ref. Gecow (2010) to 'matured chaos' onto the opposite 
shore of Kauffman's liquid region near the 'edge of chaos'. Evolution of living systems 
needing small changes is placed in the left peak of damage size distribution which was 
underestimated up till now. An other-than-zero limitation of order degree r (fraction of 
damage initiation which do not convert into large avalanche and create the left peak) found 
in the described experiment takes up the importance of this place.
